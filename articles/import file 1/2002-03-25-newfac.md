  <br>
</p>Elisabeth Cameron's present research centers on iconoclasm and the different cultural contexts in which objects are created with the intention of being destroyed. Cameron was born and raised in the Congo, and much of her work focuses on African cultures.<br>
<br>
Prior to her appointment at UCSC, Cameron held several teaching and curatorial positions, including associate curator of African art at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (LACMA). During her tenure at LACMA, Cameron won a Silver MUSE award from the American Association of Museums for her interactive game "Secrets of Ancestors" in the 1999 "Ancestors: Art and the Afterlife" exhibition.<br>
<br>
Cameron received her B.A. in fine arts from Agnes Scott College in Decatur, Georgia, and her M.A. and Ph.D. in art history from UCLA. Her dissertation is titled "Negotiating Gender: Initiation Arts of Mwadi and Mukanda among the Lunda and Luvale, Kabompo District, North-Western Province, Zambia."
