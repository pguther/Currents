</p>
<p>
  <a href="http://www.rockthevote.org"><img align="right" border="0" height="94" src="../art/rock_the-vote.gif" width="85" alt=""></a>UCSC ranked second among 16 campuses around the state in a "Rock the Vote Day" registration contest held October 4. UCSC registered 358 voters; the first place winner was UC Berkeley with 743 registrations.
</p>
<p>
  The event, declared "Rock the Vote Day-California" by California Secretary of State Bill Jones, was created to "provide college students in California with the opportunity to inspire and encourage each other to participate in the political process by registering," said Jehmu Greene, executive director of Rock the Vote. The organization was founded in 1990 by members of the recording industry with the goal of politically empowering young people. For more information, go to the <a href="http://www.rockthevote.org">Rock the Vote</a> web site.

<p>
  You can register to vote in the November 5 election until October 21. A Voter Registration Form can be obtained online by visiting the Secretary of State's web site at: <a href="http://www.ss.ca.gov/executive/pdf/eng_vote.pdf">http://www.ss.ca.gov/executive/pdf/eng_vote.pdf</a> (English), <a href="http://www.ss.ca.gov/executive/pdf/sp_vote.pdf">http://www.ss.ca.gov/executive/pdf/sp_vote.pdf</a> (Spanish), or at numerous locations on campus including McHenry Library, the Colleges, Carriage House, Bay Tree Bookstore, Student Health Center, or by stopping by your local library, post office, or other government office.<br>

  <a name="UCTV" id="UCTV"></a>UCTV programming focuses on literature during the month of October
</p>
<p>
  From John Steinbeck to Jane Smiley, literature takes center stage on UCTV this month. Contrasting the frenzied competition for "younger audiences" on commercial television networks, UCTV offers a distinctly alternative mix of book and poetry readings, author interviews, commentary, and thought-provoking discussion. October's special focus is being promoted through libraries, book clubs, and local media with the slogan "Words Worth Watching."
</p>
<p>
  On October 26, UCTV will premiere "Trampling Out the Vintage: Steinbeck and The Grapes of Wrath" a new documentary examining the genesis and history of the novel and its hold on the American imagination, featuring interviews with the author's son, Thom Steinbeck, and with UC faculty at several campuses including Berkeley, Davis, UCLA, and Santa Cruz.
</p>
<p>
  For a complete list of programs and broadcast times, visit the <a href="http://www.uctv.tv/words">UCTV</a> web site.
</p>
<p>
  Community Television of Santa Cruz County has expanded its carriage of UCTV programming on Channel 25 (AT&amp;T Broadband) to include the 8 to 11 p.m. block on Sunday evenings.<br>
