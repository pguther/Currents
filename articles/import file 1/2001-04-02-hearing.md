<p>
  The "College Infill Apartments" project, which would provide on-campus housing for approximately 640 undergraduates in apartment units that would be built at Cowell, Stevenson, and Porter Colleges, will be the subject of a public hearing on April 18.<br>
  <br>
  The meeting, from 6 to 8 p.m. at UCSC's Office of Campus and Community Planning, has been scheduled to receive comments on the project's Draft Environmental Impact Report. The office is located at 515 Swift Street in Santa Cruz.<br>
  <br>
  At this meeting, campus planners will provide a description of the project and its environmental impacts, and members of the public will be invited to give oral comments on the Draft EIR.<br>
  <br>
  The accommodations for 640 students would be provided in a total of 140 apartment units, to be divided among the three colleges. In all, 13 two- to four-story buildings would be erected. Residence halls, but not apartments, currently exist at the three colleges.<br>
  <br>
  If approved, the project could begin this summer, and the apartments could be ready for occupancy in spring 2003.<br>
