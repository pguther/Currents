  All UCSC staff members are invited to attend "Pancakes and Jazz with M.R.C.," the second annual free staff breakfast with Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood.
</p>Sponsored by the Staff Advisory Board (SAB), the buffet-style breakfast will be served from 7:30 to 9:30 a.m. at Stevenson Dining Hall on Wednesday, May 22.<br>
<br>
An extensive menu, including pastries, sausage and bacon, vegetarian items, as well as juice and coffee, will be served.<br>
<br>
The Latin jazz quartet Carne Cruda will perform, and there will be raffle drawings for prizes.<br>
<br>
"We wanted to attract as many people as possible, including those who were leaving their night shifts," said SAB member Karleen Meaker. "The early morning time seemed easier for many people to get there. Breakfast in the dining hall also allowed staff to participate in what is a big part of student life on campus."<br>
<br>
Meaker noted that the first breakfast received positive feedback from staffers and said the format will follow last year's.
