  <a name="Flowers" id="Flowers"></a><font color="#003399">Flowers and berries kick off Farm's cart opening June 4</font>
</h3>Spiff up your office or work area with a bouquet of fresh-picked flowers from the UCSC Farm's popular market cart, which opens Tuesday, June 4. While you're at it, pick up a basket of organic strawberries for a snack and some organic salad greens for dinner, too. All this and more will be available every Tuesday and Friday from noon until 6 p.m. through the growing season.<br>
<br>
The cart is located in front of the Barn Theater at the intersection of Bay and High Streets. The cold spring and late rain slowed down production in the fields, but the selection of fresh, organically grown fruits and vegetables gets better every week.<br>
<br>
All proceeds benefit the UCSC Center for Agroecology &amp; Sustainable Food Systems' apprenticeship program in ecological horticulture. For more information, call (831) 459-3248.<br>

</h3>
<p>
  Representatives of the biotechnology industry got an overview of UCSC's biomedical and biotechnology research activities recently at an all-day meeting at the UCSC Inn and Conference Center. The purpose of the meeting was to highlight opportunities for industry-university collaboration through UC's <a href="http://uc-biostar.berkeley.edu/">BioSTAR program</a>. BioSTAR (Biotechnology Strategic Targets for Alliances in Research) is a UC-wide biotechnology matching grants program that forges partnerships among businesses, UC scientists, engineers, and students. Up to $20 million is available this year to match partnering company investments in UC research.<br>
  <br>
  The meeting started with introductory remarks from Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood, Vice Chancellor of Research Robert Miller, and Susanne Huttner, director of the Industry-University Cooperative Research Program, which oversees BioSTAR. About two dozen UCSC researchers then gave brief presentations about their research. In addition to the formal program, there was a reception and various other opportunities for informal discussions and networking.<br>

  <a name="CPR" id="CPR"></a><font color="#003399">Fire Department offers CPR and basic first aid classes</font>
</h3>
<p>
  The Campus Fire Department is now offering CPR/Basic First Aid classes several times a month (no child CPR). Fire Department staff are now able to offer classes for up to 20 people per class on weekdays, weekends, or evenings. (Previously only two classes per month with a maximum of 10 people per class were offered.) Classes in Spanish will be given when class size reaches a minimum of six people. The objective is to train 2,000 people per year in CPR and first aid.<br>
  <br>
  The course takes approximately seven hours to complete and is on a first-come, first-served registration basis. The cost is $35, payable in advance at the campus Fire Department, cash, recharge, or check (made payable to the UC Regents). Failure to appear forfeits fee. Cancellation is required 48 hours prior to class for refund or rescheduling. No exceptions.<br>
  <br>
  For more information or to reserve space, call (831) 459-3473.<br>
