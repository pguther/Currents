  <font color="#003399" size="4">Graduate Commons, Whole Earth Restaurant open</font>
</h4>
<p>
  <img align="right" border="0" height="151" src="../art/whole_earth.01-09-03.224.jpg" width="224" alt="">The new Graduate Student Commons and its Whole Earth Restaurant are up and running in the Bay Tree Bookstore plaza area. The Graduate Student Commons, paid for in part by fees collected since 1965, provides a long-sought base for graduate students on its second floor, and the first floor provides a new location for the Whole Earth Restaurant, which had been in business next door.<br>
  <br>
  The restaurant has added hamburgers and french fries to its menu, and also has some new touches, including a coffee bar, carryout window, and pool table. Large windows are opened to the outdoor seating area whenever weather permits.<br>
  <br>
  With office space a problem for many UCSC graduate students, the commons offers a place where graduate students can check their e-mail, use the phone, hold office hours, socialize with other graduate students, conduct review sessions, or just relax between classes. The Graduate Commons facilities manager, Diane Brookes, may be reached at (831) 459-1395. There is also a Graduate Student Commons <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/gradcommons">web site</a> and <a href="mailto:gradcommons@cats.ucsc.edu">e-mail</a> account.<br>

  Police and firefighters were out in force for an emergency drill on August 24, featuring a siege in the Community Room of the Crown-Merrill Apartments and evacuation of the "wounded" by helicopter and ambulance. <img align="right" alt="terrorism drill" border="0" height="146" src="../art/drill.01-09-03.224.jpg" width="224"><br>
  <br>
  Police, who had exchanged their usual weapons for red plastic ones, "shot" the attacker dead after one student was killed and several wounded in the mock attack. Student workers were enlisted to play victims.<br>
  <br>
  Eno said the drill was a success, but highlighted some problems that could arise in such a situation. One communications difficulty, Eno said, was caused by UCSC using its own separate radio system. Eno also said that the number of fire engines being used to fight wildfires around the state meant that fewer were available to participate in the drill.<br>
  <br>
  There was also a problem police and firefighters never have in real life: not enough victims. It turns out that some who were supposed to take on the role of victims didn't show up.<br>

  <font color="#003399"><b>Getting the facts gets easier</b></font><br>
  <br>
  A new online service that allows researchers and the public to discover and use government data about California is now available.<br>
  <br>
  Taking advantage of Internet and digital library technologies, the service, called <a href="http://countingcalifornia.cdlib.org">Counting California</a>, enhances public access to the growing range of social science and economic information from government agencies.<br>
  <br>
  Researchers and the public can find current and historical census data, almanac-style statistics, county business data, and a range of education, crime, election, and demographic information from nearly a dozen different sources. The user can also have information mapped or a bar chart produced. The University of California's California Digital Library developed and hosts Counting California with support from state and federal research grants.

  <font color="#003399">Wondering what to do with that old monitor?</font>
</h4>
<p>
  <font color="#000000">Don't throw it in the trash. It's now against the law to discard TVs or computer monitors as trash. Recent regulatory changes require these items to be recycled through Campus Surplus (a free service) or disposed of as hazardous waste (expensive). Contact Steve Goldie in Campus Surplus at (831) 459-2852 to arrange for recycling.<br>
  <br>
  For more information, check the</font> <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/matman/receiving/usedcomputers.htm">Campus Surplus web page</a> <font color="#000000">or the</font> <a href="http://ehs.ucsc.edu/hw/crt.htm">EH&amp;S web page</a><font color="#000000">, which includes information on what to do with broken or shattered units.</font>

  <font color="#003399">Organic produce at the Farm market cart Tuesdays and Fridays</font>
</h4>
<p>
  <font color="#000000">The campus's popular market cart, located at the corner of Bay and High Streets, is overflowing with fresh organic produce and lovely flower bouquets each Tuesday and Friday afternoon from noon until 6 p.m.<br>

<h4>
  <font color="#003399">Staff and faculty mentors sought</font>
</h4>
<p>
  The Page and Eloise Smith Scholastic Society is bringing together UCSC alumni, faculty, and staff to serve the educational aspirations of UCSC students who are foster children, wards of the court, and orphans. There will be over 40 of these students on campus this fall. They will receive scholarships from the Page and Eloise Smith Scholastic Society, but they will also need other help.<br>
  <br>
  Can you help someone through the registration process? Could you correspond occasionally via e-mail with a student needing advice about a major? Perhaps you could help a new student connect with just the right faculty member to explore their visions or goals. If you are interested in any level of mentorship relationship with a current student who has been a foster child, ward of the court, or orphan, please contact Lynn Zachreson in the Alumni Office at (831) 459-5842.
