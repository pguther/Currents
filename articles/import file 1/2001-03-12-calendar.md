<p>
  CruzTime, a new, online calendar service for faculty and staff, has been approved for the UCSC campus. Users will be able to attend training and begin using the CruzTime system by fall quarter. A registration process will be announced later this spring.<br>
  <br>
  CruzTime will be operated by Communications and Technology Services (CATS) for campus units. Using the CorporateTime product, CruzTime automates calendar management and meeting scheduling, while helping departments manage and share resources such as conference rooms and projectors.
</p>
<p>
  CorporateTime was selected by a campus task force and approved by the campus Information Technology Committee as the product best suited to supporting scheduling of meetings.
</p>
<p>
  It is compatible with Macintosh, Windows, and Unix desktops, and the web. CorporateTime is a full-featured calendaring system that provides users with security, task list management, contact management, group scheduling and more.
</p>
<p>
  The campus calendaring project was created to develop a consensus on a personal calendaring system at UCSC. Representatives from the four academic divisions and three administrative divisions have worked over the last two years to assess and recommend a standard software package for the campus.<br>
  <br>
  Many UCSC departments now manage their office calendars using incompatible scheduling systems. CruzTime provides a common infrastructure for calendar services available to any units wishing to participate.<br>
  <br>
  The focus of CruzTime is on personal calendars rather than<br>
  classroom scheduling or event scheduling, each of which has<br>
  support systems already in place.<br>
  <br>
