  During a visit to campus Thursday, U.S. Rep. Sam Farr lauded UCSC for its large number of graduates serving in the Peace Corps and announced plans for legislation designed to allow the Peace Corps to maintain its independence.
</p>Farr, a Peace Corps volunteer himself in Colombia during the 1960s, was joined by several former Peace Corps volunteers in a talk at Quarry Plaza.
<p>
  The former volunteers spoke about their experiences, and a Peace Corps recruiting table was set up following Farr's presentation. UCSC ranks eighth in the nation in the number of its graduates serving in the Peace Corps.<br>
  <br>
  The congressman noted that while he welcomes President Bush's proposal to double the number of Peace Corps volunteers over the next five years, he believes it is important that the Peace Corps retain its independence.
</p>
<p>
  The president's newly established Freedom Corps "serves as a conduit for which Americans can locate an organization such as the Peace Corps, Americorps, Senior Corps, etc. to serve with," said Catherine Clobucker of the Peace Corps' San Francisco office.<br>
  <br>
  Bush created the wide-ranging Freedom Corps by executive order, with "opportunities for participation in homeland security preparedness and response," one of many service opportunities cited.<br>
  <br>
  Noting that Peace Corps volunteers are already sometimes suspected of being spies, Farr said there should be a clear separation between the Freedom Corps and the Peace Corps. Any perception of a Peace Corps link to intelligence-gathering would be "the worst thing that could happen to our volunteers."<br>
  <br>
  Farr is also calling for strengthening the Peace Corps through increased outreach to the Muslim world; educating volunteers in prevention and treatment of infectious diseases, including AIDS; and increased support staff for the Peace Corps at home and abroad. In addition, Farr proposes establishment of the "Shriver Fund," named for the Peace Corps' first director, Sargent Shriver. The fund would allow returned Peace Corps volunteers to develop activities in underserved areas.<br>
  <br>
  UCSC graduates' disproportionately large role in the Peace Corps--it is the smallest campus among the top 10 schools contributing graduates--also drew praise from Lynda Goff, vice provost and dean of undergraduate education. "There is a real spirit of altruism on this campus," she said, leading to the campus's "wonderful success" in providing Peace Corps volunteers.<br>
  <br>
  Students had plenty of questions for Peace Corps recruiters Thursday. Dennis McMahon, a spokesman for the Peace Corps in San Francisco, was on hand to answer questions and clear up any misconceptions. "A lot of people forget we're still around," he said. Appearances such as Farr's generate interest and offer the Peace Corps more visibility. McMahon said many people also don't realize that Peace Corps workers are paid, and that their expenses are covered.<br>
  <br>
  Three informational events are designed for those interested in learning more about joining the Peace Corps. Peace Corps staff will be on hand from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. at the Bay Tree Building, Room B, on April 4, and at 6:30 p.m. April 11 and 6:30 p.m. May 21 at the Louden Nelson Community Center, 301 Center St., Santa Cruz. Information is also available on the <a href="http://www.peacecorps.gov">web</a>.<br>
  <br>
  After his presentation, Farr reflected on how his Peace Corps days brought him to a career of public service. Working in community development in the barrios of Colombia, Farr said he taught people how to petition their government to get things done. He said he discovered he liked finding out what the community needed, then working to get it. "I thought I could do this even better in my own culture," Farr said, noting the parallels to his job as congressman.<br>
  <br>
  Farr said that his wife, Shary, tells him " 'You're still a Peace Corps volunteer--you've just changed barrios."
