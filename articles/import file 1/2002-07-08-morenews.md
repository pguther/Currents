  <a name="Seymour" id="Seymour"></a>Incredible Invertebrates star in Seymour Center summer programs
</h3>
<p>
  How do sea jellies sting? (And why don't they call them jellyfish?) What do crabs and their kin do that makes them masters of life in the sea? Tube worms and sea stars have some of the oddest table manners--find out why at the Seymour Marine Discovery Center.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The Seymour Center's visitor programs this summer focus on "Incredible Invertebrates," highlighting the amazing lives of marine animals without backbones. The programs will continue through September 1.<br>
</p>
<p>
  For a fascinating trip through the world of spineless wonders, visitors can take part in one of the "See More" Labs offered every day at the center. Lab activities include "Jumpin' Jellies," "Awesome Adaptations," and "Crab Lab." A complete schedule and descriptions of activities are available on the <a href="http://seymourcenter.ucsc.edu">Seymour Center web site</a>.<br>
</p>
<p>
  On Wednesday, August 14, UCSC researcher Allison Gong will describe the features and adaptations of marine invertebrates in a public lecture titled "We Don't Need No Stinkin' Backbones! or Lifestyles of the Cold and Spineless." Her talk begins at 7 p.m. at the Seymour Center. Admission is $5 for the general public, $4 for members. Tickets are available at the Seymour Center or by calling (831) 459-3800.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The Seymour Center, located Long Marine Laboratory, features aquariums, exhibits, a hands-on seawater table, and an 87-foot blue whale skeleton. Tours of Long Marine Lab are offered daily. The center is open Tuesday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and on Sunday from noon to 5 p.m. It is closed Monday. Admission is $5 for adults, $3 for students and seniors, and free for children ages 5 and under.<br>

  <a name="Professional" id="Professional"></a>Professional women's organization donates archive to library's Special Collections
</p>
<p>
  The Santa Cruz Business and Professional Women's Organization (BPW) has donated its archive to UC Santa Cruz, along with a donation to support the processing and cataloging of the archive, which includes historic ephemera and realia. The BPW archive will be housed in McHenry Library's Special Collections.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The local chapter of the BPW, an international and national organization promoting equity for all women in the workplace through advocacy, education, and information, was founded in 1928. The chapter's archive preserves an important part of Santa Cruz history and enriches the Santa Cruz historical archive in Special Collections.
</p>
<p>
  Members of the Santa Cruz BPW previously established a Leadership Opportunity Awards scholarship at UCSC as well as a scholarship at Cabrillo College.<br>

  <a name="Draft" id="Draft"></a>Draft on housing access to be posted before fall public forum
</p>
<p>
  The committee looking at access policies for university-owned housing for faculty and staff plans to have a draft recommendation ready two weeks before the next public forum, tentatively scheduled for mid-September. That draft will be posted on the <a href="http://planning.ucsc.edu/pac/cwc.html">Campus Welfare Committee web site.</a>
</p>
<p>
  The Campus Welfare Committee is meeting throughout the summer and plans to make a recommendation in early October to John Simpson, campus provost and executive vice chancellor. Simpson had initially directed the committee to make a recommendation on housing by June 15, but the committee requested more time to gather information and receive input from the campus community, said Assistant Chancellor Leslie Sunell, the committee chair. A campus forum on housing was held May 20.<br>
</p>
<p>
  In August, the Campus Welfare Committee will receive the results of an independent survey of demand for university-sponsored housing among faculty and staff. The committee is now working on a concept paper to be used in further discussion with the campus community in the fall. (<a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/currents/01-02/05-27/housing.html">See related Currents stories</a>.)<br>

</p>
<p>
  The Campus Fire Department is now offering CPR/Basic First Aid classes several times a month (no child CPR). Fire Department staff are now able to offer classes for up to 20 people per class on weekdays, weekends, or evenings. (Previously only two classes per month with a maximum of 10 people per class were offered.) Classes in Spanish will be given when class size reaches a minimum of six people. The objective is to train 2,000 people per year in CPR and first aid.<br>
  <br>
  The course takes approximately seven hours to complete and is on a first-come, first-served registration basis. The cost is $35, payable in advance at the campus Fire Department, by cash, recharge, or check (made payable to the UC Regents). Failure to appear forfeits fee. Cancellation is required 48 hours prior to class for refund or rescheduling. No exceptions.<br>
  <br>
