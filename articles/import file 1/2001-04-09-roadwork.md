<p>
  Caltrans has alerted the campus that construction in the middle of the Bay/Mission intersection is scheduled to begin Monday, April 9, and may last through Thursday, April 12.<br>
  <br>
  While this work is under way, southbound Bay Street traffic will be required to turn left or right onto Mission--traffic will not be allowed to continue south through the intersection (toward the Wharf).<br>
  <br>
  Similarly, SCMTD's Route 1B Lower Bay buses will detour onto Mission Street before continuing south along Bay from California toward West Cliff Drive. "Road Construction Ahead" signs will be posted along Bay Street at King Street (southbound) and at Seaside (northbound) to warn traffic of the construction work.<br>
  <br>
  Commuters should call the Mission Street Widening Project's 24-hour information hotline (420-6242) for up-to-the-hour status reports on construction delays and detours. Please remember that all work is weather-dependent.<br>
  <br>
  This work is necessary to connect a new 14-inch water main into the existing city water system and has been scheduled to coincide with the spring break at Bay View Elementary School. If all goes smoothly, the work may be completed in only two days instead of the scheduled four. Similar work conducted along Mission Street since December has allowed water and storm drain systems to be installed or renovated prior to the next phase of the Mission Street widening project.<br>
  <br>
  Stage 2 of the Mission Street widening project is scheduled to begin in early May and will affect the roadway between Otis and Bay Streets. Work will proceed on the northbound side of Mission through July, then shift to the southbound side. Current plans indicate that Stage 2 will be completed in August.

  Construction along this section of Mission is likely to have the greatest impact on university-related traffic--including the SCMTD bus routes along Laurel and Walnut Streets. Fortunately, Caltrans's efforts to schedule this work during the late spring and summer--and complete it before the start of fall quarter--should help reduce impacts on the campus and local community.<br>
