<p>
  <font color="#000000">David H. Anthony, associate professor of history and provost of Oakes College, was one of the contributors to the study guide for the documentary film,</font> <a href="http://www.irisfilms.org/longnight/"><i>Long Night's Journey Into Day: South Africa's Search for Truth and Reconciliation,</i></a> <font color="#000000">produced by Frances Reid and Deborah Hoffmann for Iris Films. The film won the Grand Jury Prize for Best Documentary at the Sundance Film Festival 2000. It presents four cases from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission hearings that illustrate the range of political violence with which the TRC struggled to deal. These were the cases of Amy Biehl, an American antiapartheid activist killed by a South African youth; the Cradock 4, organizers assassinated by police; Robert McBride, an African National Congress activist charged with triple bombings of civilian targets; and the Guguletu 7, seven young men killed in a police set-up. For the study guide, Anthony prepared a comparative history of South Africa and the United States. This powerful film is an extremely important social document. A video edition of the film is currently available through</font> <a href="http://www.newsreel.org/films/longnight.htm">California Newsreel.</a>

<p>
  Edward Houghton, professor of music and dean of the Arts Division, presented a lecture on the music of Johannes Ockeghem in October at the National Institute for Music Research in Berlin. The lecture preceded the first performance of his critical edition of Ockeghem's <i>Missa Au travail suis,</i> sung by the Tallis Scholars at the opening concerts of the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester at Philharmonic Hall. Ockeghem's 15th-century masterpiece was juxtaposed with Gustav Mahler's monumental Ninth Symphony. "Ockeghem und Mahler: Geht das?" asked the critic of <i>Der Tagespiegel</i> and also answered, "Es geht wunderbar."<br>
  <br>
  An essay by Houghton, titled "A close reading of Compere's motet <i>Sile fragor,</i>" appears in the recent book <i>Essays on Music and Culture in Honor of Herbert Kellman</i>, published in the series <i>Epitome musical</i> by the Centre d'Etudes Superieures de la Renaissance (Tours, France).
