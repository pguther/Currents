<p>
  Bringing together researchers and community organizers to improve the lives of indigenous Mexican migrants in the United States will be the focus of a two-day conference at UCSC on October 11-12.
</p>
<p>
  Sponsored by the UCSC Latin American and Latino Studies Department (LALS), the conference is titled, "Indigenous Mexican Migrants in the U.S.: Building Bridges between Researchers and Community Leaders."
</p>
<p>
  It will take place in Spanish, with English translation, at the UCSC Inn and Conference Center.
</p>
<p>
  The event is being cosponsored by Frente Indigena Oaxaqueno Binacional (FIOB), the UCSC Chicano/Latino Research Center (CLRC), and the UCSC Center for Justice, Tolerance, and Community (CJTC).
</p>
<p>
  Friday's morning session will feature a roundtable discussion among transnational indigenous organizers who will discuss "lessons from the past and challenges for the future." Guillermo Delgado, a UCSC lecturer in LALS, will take part in the discussion.
</p>
<p>
  After lunch, UCSC anthropology professor Olga Najera Ramirez, codirector of the CLRC, will moderate a panel discussion of indigenous migrant civic and social organizations.
</p>
<p>
  Jonathan Fox, a professor and chair of the LALS department, will moderate a third panel discussion on social and economic processes.

  Saturday's program continues with panel discussions on comparative perspectives on ethnic and geographic diversity; migrant social and civic participation in communities of origin; and the challenges of coalition-building. UCSC participants include Patricia Zavella, professor of LALS and codirector of the CLRC.

  A plenary discussion will examine opportunities for future research and action moderated by Manuel Pastor, professor of LALS and director of the CJTC.<br>
