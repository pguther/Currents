The book, <i>Telling to Live: Latina Feminist Testimonios</i> (Durham: Duke University Press, 2001) by the Latina Feminist Group, presents the stories of a diverse intergenerational group of 18 Latina feminists.
</p>
<p>
  In stories, poems, memoirs, and reflections, the authors describe their struggles, often against great odds, to become "credentialed creative thinkers and writers" and to succeed in academia. The book reveals the relationships of sustenance and creativity that sustained them along the way.
</p>
<p>
  This diverse group of Puerto Rican, Chicana, Native American, Mexican, Cuban, Dominican, Sephardic, Central American, and women of mixed heritage embodies the vision that compelled Latina feminists to find common ground. The authors reflect varied class, religious, ethnic, racial, linguistic, sexual, and national backgrounds as they reclaim <i>testimonio</i> as a tool for theorizing the complexities of Latina identities.
