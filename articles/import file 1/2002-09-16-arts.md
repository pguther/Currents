<p>
  From theater to music, dance to the spoken word, the new UCSC Arts &amp; Lectures season has something for everyone.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Highlights from this year's 23 world-class performances include:<br>
</p>
<p>
  * the Master Dancers of Bali, opening the Arts &amp; Lectures season on September 26 with their first tour outside of Indonesia<br>
</p>
<p>
  * humorist and author David Sedaris<br>
</p>
<p>
  * the Guarneri String Quartet, the longest-continuing artistic collaboration of any quartet in the United States
</p>
<p>
  * drummer Mickey Hart's new nine-piece band, Bembe Orisha<br>
</p>
<p>
  * the family event Imago Theater: Frogz, and<br>
</p>
<p>
  * the Afro-Cuban All Stars, a 13-piece dream band featuring four generations of Cuba's finest musicians and singers.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Arts &amp; Lectures also features opportunities for audience members to meet the artists at informal discussions before or after performances. Flamenco dancers Farruquito and Juana Amaya, classical musicians in the Arden Trio, and the Celtic folk music group Hesperus are among the performers participating in the meet-the-artist program.
</p>
<p>
  Other special events include selected shows with related film screenings prior to the performances, and a campus art exhibition complementing the "Ruben Martinez: Songs from the Borderline" performance.
