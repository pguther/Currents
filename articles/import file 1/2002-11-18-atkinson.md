<p>
  Richard C. Atkinson has announced that he will resign as the president of the University of California, effective October 1, 2003.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Atkinson, 73, took office October 1, 1995, and will have served for eight years when he steps down. He is the 17th president of the University of California system.
</p>
<p>
  "That is a lengthy period of time for positions of this kind," Atkinson told the Board of Regents at a meeting in San Francisco. "These have been extremely rewarding years -- challenging, stimulating, and deeply interesting years. But the time has come to bring them to a close, and to allow the University to move forward under new leadership. It also is time, I might add, for my grandchildren to see more of their grandfather."
