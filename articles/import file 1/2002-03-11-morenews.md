  <a name="Learn" id="Learn"></a><font color="#003399">Learn how to control gophers at March 16 workshop; concurrent workshop for kids, too</font>
</h3>If those telltale mounds of freshly upturned earth in your garden make you hiss like an agitated house cat, you'll want to learn the best ways to keep your garden gopher-free during a workshop on Saturday, March 16, at the Farm. Note: An incorrect date appeared in the March 1 paper <i>Currents.</i>
<p>
  Last year was a banner year for gophers, and this year is shaping up to be "pretty severe," according to workshop leader Thomas Wittman, who will share his tips on controlling and excluding gophers from 10 a.m. to noon at the Louise Cain Gatehouse. Wittman's talk will focus on nonpoison strategies of gopher control, including traps and exclusion.
</p>
<p>
  Cost is $10; $5 for members of the Friends of the UCSC Farm &amp; Garden. Fees are payable at the workshop. For more information, call (831) 459-3240.
</p>
<p>
  Concurrent with the gopher talk will be a workshop for children, "Predators on Our Farm." Sponsored by the Life Lab Science Program based at UCSC, this workshop for children ages 7-11 will explore bats, owls, and other predators that help control pests in the garden. Highlights include educational activities, a farm tour, and videos. The children's workshop will take place on Saturday, March 16, from 10 a.m. to noon in the Life Lab Garden Classroom at the UCSC Farm. Cost is $5 per child. Preregistration is required; for more information or to register, call (831) 459-2001.<br>

<p>
  <font color="#000000">If you haven't filed your taxes yet, here's an easy way to support the search for a cure for breast cancer. Line 56 on the 2001 California Income Tax Return Form 540 provides an opportunity to make a donation from your tax refund--or add to your tax bill a contribution--to the Breast Cancer Research Fund. The</font> <a href="http://www.ucop.edu/srphome/bcrp/">California Breast Cancer Research Program,</a> <font color="#000000">which is administered by the University of California, spearheads research efforts into the causes, prevention, detection, and treatment of breast cancer.<br>
  <br>
  Breast cancer is the most common cancer to strike women in California. In 2002, it is estimated that more than 20,000 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in California alone, and more than 4,200 women in the state will die of the disease.
