The show was curated by Cameron, a specialist in central African arts.<br>

  The objects in the exhibit comprise one of the world's most comprehensive collections of Lega art. The exhibit highlights the role the arts play in Lega society and their importance to the Lega people of the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
