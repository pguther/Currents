  Two UCSC biologists served on a UC Marine Council scientific advisory committee that has just published a report on the ecological impacts of oil rig decommissioning in California. <b>Peter Raimondi,</b> associate professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, <b>Mark Carr,</b> assistant professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, and four other UC experts authored the report, entitled <a href="http://www.ucop.edu/research/ucmc_decommissioning/">"Ecological Issues Related to Decommissioning of California's Offshore Production Platforms."</a> <b><br>
  <br></b>The UC Marine Council was established in 1999 and is chaired by Gary Griggs, director of the Institute of Marine Sciences. Shortly after it was created, state senator Dede Alpert of San Diego asked UC President Richard Atkinson to convene a blue ribbon commission to assess the ecological impacts of decommissioning California's offshore oil production facilities. This is a major issue in southern California with potentially huge financial impacts. The marine council set up the scientific advisory committee, which spent six months investigating the issue and preparing the new report.<br>
