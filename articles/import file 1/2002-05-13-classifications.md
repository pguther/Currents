  If you've got questions about any aspect of job classifications at UCSC, you can now look for answers online, thanks to a new series of Classification Process <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/staff_hr/ClassificationProcess/index.htm">web pages</a> created by Staff Human Resources.
</p>
<p>
  "Our overall objective in developing the web pages has been to demystify the classification process for campus employees, supervisors, and managers," said Willeen McQuitta, director of Staff Human Resources.<br>
  <br>
  McQuitta said the web pages evolved from a recommendation in the "<a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/staff_hr/consulting/classrpt.pdf">Classification Review Process Examination Project Report</a>" in May 2000, which cited feedback from employees and supervisors that there is a lack of information available about the classification process.<br>
  <br>
  Among the subjects covered on the web pages are <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/staff_hr/ClassificationProcess/classhome.htm">Why are jobs reclassified?</a>, <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/staff_hr/ClassificationProcess/decision.htm">How the decision is made,</a> and <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/staff_hr/ClassificationProcess/salary.htm">Salary determination.</a><br>
  <br>
  Also included is a new form, the <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/staff_hr/ClassificationProcess/index.htm">Classification Review Questionnaire.</a> "In an effort to expedite classification reviews, we are implementing this questionnaire with an eye to reducing the occurrence of time-consuming informational interviews, formerly known as desk audits," said McQuitta. She said her office will be assessing the questionnaire's viability and requesting feedback as it is used.<br>
  <br>
  McQuitta noted that information in the Classification Process web pages is general, and that those needing specific details should check the <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/comp/manual/">Staff Human Resources Procedures Manual,</a> the personnel policies and collective bargaining agreements, or contact their service center or Staff Human Resources.<br>
  <br>
  McQuitta also emphasized, "We are trying to move our department toward a self-service organization where managers, staff, and faculty will have access to information, policies, procedures and other resources at their desktop. This is in line with the University's <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/currents/00-01/09-11/arch.html">'New Business Architecture'</a> framework. The Classification Process web pages are an example of the direction we want to go."
