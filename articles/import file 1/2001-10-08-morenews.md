</h3><br>
<font color="#000000">The power of UCSC's banana slug mascot has reached Japan. A production company, shooting footage for a Japanese television newsmagazine story about slugs, visited UCSC to collect banana slug images. They videotaped students in slugwear; the multitude of slug items at the bookstore; and slugs on signs around campus. Sammy the Slug mascot made an appearance for the film crew in the Quarry Plaza. Transfixed and delighted by Sammy's cavorting, one student said, "I want to give the slug a hug," and promptly did.<br>
<br>
The film crew interviewed Lynda Goff, biology professor and dean of undergraduate education, on why the banana slug makes a good mascot. Students were also videotaped giving impromptu interviews on the power of the slug. "UCSC students are unique, and the slug is a unique mascot," one said as she explained her fondness for the mascot. "I love the banana slug."</font>
