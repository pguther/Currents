  <a name="Enron" id="Enron"></a>UC settles with Arthur Andersen's international firms in Enron lawsuit
</p>
<p>
  On behalf of Enron Corp. investors, the University of California has tentatively reached, subject to the approval of certain of the principals and the court, a $40 million settlement with Arthur Andersen's international umbrella organization in the Enron securities and pension class-action suits.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Andersen Worldwide, SC, and its non-U.S. member firms will be released from liability and dismissed from the suit; the U.S. firm (Arthur Andersen LLP) and its members will not be released and will remain in the suit.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The settlement funds will eventually be divided among class members on the basis of an allocation formula that estimates their pro-rata share of total class damages. The division of the Andersen payment between the securities and pension classes will also be determined later. <a href="http://www.ucop.edu/news/archives/2002/aug27art1.htm">See full story.<i><br></i></a><a href="#Fall"><i>Back to top</i></a>

<p>
  Preparation work for the new UCSC Engineering Building has prompted the closing of Lot 139, the lot behind Baskin Engineering Building. The lot is expected to remain closed, with the contractor likely to break ground on the new building this month. New handicapped spaces are available for those who require them. There are also some spaces reserved for university and service vehicles. Others should park in the Core West Parking Structure or Lot 150, which is also known as the North Perimeter Lot. Guests to the campus may use pay station spaces at the parking structure.
