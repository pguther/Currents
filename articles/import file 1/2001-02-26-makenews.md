  UCSC's role in the Human Genome Project was highlighted in the <i>New York Times</i> in a story on the front page of the science section about the work of <b>Jim Kent,</b> a graduate student in biology, and <b>David Haussler,</b> professor of computer science. The article characterized Kent as "a surprising hero" of the genome project for writing the computer program that assembled the first draft of the human genome sequence. The most striking praise came from the chief rival of the public genome consortium, Craig Venter of Celera Genomics, who said, "What Haussler did was he came in and saved [the consortium]. Haussler put it all together." Kent and Haussler's work was also featured in the <i>San Francisco Chronicle,</i> <i>San Jose Mercury News,</i> and <i>Santa Cruz Sentinel.</i> Haussler was interviewed by KGO radio in San Francisco and so many other media outlets, he said, "I lost track--the phone was ringing off the hook."
