  The UCSC Academic Senate will meet at 3 p.m. on Wednesday, March 6, in Classroom Unit 2. George Blumenthal, chair of the Academic Senate, sent a letter to senate members outlining some of the key issues coming up. The letter is below:<br>
  <br>
  "Several key issues relating to campus growth and planning for UCSC's future will dominate the agenda for our first 2002 meeting of the Santa Cruz Division of the Academic Senate. The meeting will take place on Wednesday, March 6, at 3 p.m. at Classroom Unit 2.
</p>
<p>
  The Committee on Planning and Budget, the Committee on Research and the Graduate Council are proposing that the Senate adopt a resolution that establishes a goal of 15 percent for the fraction of our student body pursuing graduate studies. This resolution calls upon the Senate and the administration to jointly plan to attain this goal as we approach our Long Range Development Plan limit of 15,000 students on campus. This ratio of 15 percent could have a profound effect on our campus as it shapes our student body and affects the very nature of the campus for faculty, undergraduates and the graduate students we attract.<br>
  <br>
  The Committee on Committees and the Committee on Planning and Budget are proposing that the Senate establish a special committee on the colleges. This proposal was motivated in part by the campus 10-year planning process, and it is worthwhile to take a moment to read the CPB submission on this (AS/SCP 1338) for a brief but clear articulation of their reasoning behind this proposal. The special committee would report back to the Senate on the best ways to use the colleges as a valuable resource.<br>
  <br>
  The Senate Advisory Committee is proposing a bylaw modification to lower the quorum to be more akin to other UC campuses. This change is needed for the efficient conduct of Senate business.<br>
  <br>
  Finally, the Committee on Admissions and Financial Aid will report on database management at UCSC and will report on the new BOARS discussion paper on standardized tests for freshman admissions. This paper, which is available <a href="http://www.ucop.edu/senate/current.html">online,</a> proposes that UC encourage the development of a new standardized test to replace the SAT I exam now used in UC admissions.<br>
  <br>
  I encourage you to attend and participate in this important meeting of the Senate. Because of room constraints, it will be necessary to end the meeting before 5 p.m."
