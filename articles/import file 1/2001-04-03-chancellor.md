  In recognition for outstanding leadership and achievement, Chancellor Greenwood received a Women of Achievement award in a ceremony March 28 at the Fairmont Hotel in San Jose.<br>
  <br>
  Nominated by Susan Hammer, UCSC Foundation trustee and former mayor of the City of San Jose, Greenwood was among 14 women feted at the annual event sponsored by the Women's Fund of Silicon Valley and the <i>San Jose Mercury News.</i><br>
  <br>
  The honor recognizes Greenwood's career achievements, with special focus on her efforts to support the success of other women and to inspire girls to excel in math and science.<br>
  <br>
  A number of UCSC staff, faculty, Foundation trustees, and other friends joined the chancellor for the evening. A special guest was Seanne Greenwood, granddaughter of the chancellor.<br>
  <br>
  The Women of Achievement awards program, now in its 28th year, was developed to spotlight the accomplishments of women and their significant contributions to the dynamism and diversity of Silicon Valley and the Bay Area. This year, there were 73 nominees from throughout the region.<br>
  <br>
  Nominees were chosen from a variety of categories; Greenwood was recognized in the education category.<br>
  <br>
  This year's winner for the arts category was Claire Der Torossian, founder and executive director of the Bay Shore Lyric Opera Company in Capitola. Mrs. Der Torossian is the wife of Papken Der Torossian, a newly appointed member of the UCSC Foundation Board. Previous winners include trustee Susan Hammer, in 1990.
