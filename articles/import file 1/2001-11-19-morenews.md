</h3>
<p>
  Bruce Bridgeman, professor of psychology and psychobiology, is featured on an upcoming Travel Channel program called "Out of this World." Bridgeman demystifies the effects of one of the Santa Cruz area's most beloved landmarks, the Mystery Spot, as well as similar spots around the country.
</p>
<p>
  In the segment, which will air on the Travel Channel at 8 p.m. on November 25, Bridgeman describes how the perceptual confusions that people experience at the Mystery Spot are natural phenomena explained by known principles of perceptual psychology. The real news of the Mystery Spot is how powerful these natural effects can be, said Bridgeman, who has conducted research on perception at the Mystery Spot.
