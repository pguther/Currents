</h4>
<p>
  Marcia "Toni" Landels Hyman, a past board member of the UC Santa Foundation, died of cancer December 2 at her home in San Francisco. She was 65.<br>
  <br>
  A staunch environmentalist, Mrs. Hyman supported the preservation of redwood forests, especially the Landels-Hill Big Creek Reserve in Big Sur, which her father, Edward D. Landels, helped to establish. The Big Creek Reserve is part of the University of California Natural Reserve System, and it is one of four natural reserves for which UC Santa Cruz has administrative responsibility.
</p>
<p>
  Mrs. Hyman served on the board of the UC Santa Cruz Foundation from 1997 to 2001. She was also an active supporter of the Arboretum. The New Zealand Garden at the Arboretum is named for her father.
</p>
<p>
  Mrs. Hyman loved nature and the outdoors. She enjoyed wildfower hikes, tennis, riding, and camping.
</p>
<p>
  Contributions in her name should be sent to the UCSC Foundation for the Big Creek Reserve fund at the Carriage House, UC Santa Cruz, 1156 High St., Santa Cruz, CA 95064.
