  New Faculty
</p>
<p>
  <span class="sectionhead">Stacy Kamehiro</span><br>
  Assistant Professor of Art History
</p>
<p>
  Stacy Kamehiro's work focuses on the visual cultures of Oceania. Her work is interdisciplinary in nature, drawing on art historical, historical, anthropological, and cultural studies theories and methodologies. Her research centers on the relationship between art production and identity politics (political, social, ethnic, gendered, and national identities), particularly in situations of culture contact and colonization. Kamehiro is currently studying public art and art institutions in late 19th-century Hawai'i. She joins the UCSC faculty after teaching in the Department of Art and Art History at the University of Redlands. She received a B.A. In visual arts (studio art and art history) at UC San Diego and her M.A. and Ph.D. in art history from UC Los Angeles.
