</h4>Gary Griggs, professor of Earth sciences and director of the Institute of Marine Sciences, was recently honored as an alumnus by both of the institutions where he received his degrees: UC Santa Barbara and Oregon State University.<br>
<br>
At UCSB, where Griggs received his bachelor's degree in geology, the Department of Geological Sciences honored him as one of its alumni of the year. Every year, the department celebrates the accomplishments of two of its alumni, one from industry and one from academia. Another UCSB alumnus now at UCSC, professor of Earth sciences Casey Moore, received the same honor in 1999.<br>
<br>
Oregon State University, where Griggs received his Ph.D. in oceanography, recognized his accomplishments in an "Alumni Profile" in the campus magazine. The profile noted that at UCSC, Griggs has been "a trailblazer in establishing relationships between UCSC and federal, state, academic, and community organizations."
