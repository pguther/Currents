  Large trees removed from UCSC to make way for the Physical Sciences Building are finding a new use in the Carmel River, as part of a habitat restoration project.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The Monterey Peninsula Water Management District, in cooperation with UCSC, Big Creek Lumber Company, the California Department of Fish and Game, and the Monterey Peninsula Regional Parks District, is installing large wood habitat "structures" along 400 feet of the Carmel River near in Carmel Valley Village.
</p>
<p>
  The logs used in the project were kept at Big Creek Lumber for about two years in preparation for the project and are valued at about $10,000. In addition to donating the logs, Big Creek Lumber also donated the labor to take the logs to the Carmel River.
</p>
<p>
  The 40-foot-long tree stumps, with their root balls still attached, have been placed in the river to create fish habitat for sensitive aquatic species such as steelhead, California red-legged frogs and western pond turtles.
</p>
<p>
  The trees have been partially buried in the river bank and attached to 4- and 5-ton boulders with cables to keep them from coming loose during a flood. "It's sort of a ball and chain effect," said Water Resources Engineer Larry Hampson. "The log and rock structures will provide shade and cover at most flows for steelhead throughout their life cycle," said Hampson. "Vegetation near the streamside will provide shade and food (in the form of insects) directly to the stream."
</p>
<p>
  River restoration activities are part of the district's comprehensive management program for the Carmel River, the community's primary source of supply.
</p>
<p>
  According to district fishery biologist Dave Dettman, in past years large wood was removed by public agencies, including the district, to maintain as clear a river channel as possible in storms.
</p>
<p>
  Since the listing of steelhead and California red-legged frog as federally threatened species, more attention has been focused on the key role of large wood in providing habitat for fish and frogs.
</p>
<p>
  Removal of large wood is no longer allowed as a routine activity. "Introducing large wood presents both an opportunity to improve the aquatic habitat and also a challenge for agencies responsible for channel maintenance in the urbanized portion of the river (from the ocean to approximately Camp Steffani)," said Dettman.
</p>
<p>
  Hampson noted that the $60,000 restoration effort is an example of public and private funds working together. The district is providing design, construction management, and project environmental monitoring to be reimbursed up to $69,000 by the California Department of Fish and Game, through a grant from Proposition 13 funds for the California Coastal Salmon Recovery Plan. UCSC and Big Creek donated five large redwood logs with rootballs and five Douglas Fir logs. The Regional Parks District has approved placement of the logs on its property.
