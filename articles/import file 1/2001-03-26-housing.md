  <br>
  S. Sue Johnson, chair of the University of California Board of Regents, has announced the formation of a systemwide task force to seek ways to make housing more affordable and available for students, faculty and staff.<br>
  <br>
  Members of the task force, not yet announced, will include representatives of the Board of Regents, campuses, the Academic Senate, students, and friends of the university familiar with government planning, development and financing.<br>
  <br>
  Task force members will:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Examine the current process for university construction of residence halls and apartments on campus.
  </li>
  <li>Study additional ways the university can work with third parties to provide housing.
  </li>
  <li>Study ways of providing financial assistance to those who purchase homes so that the initial purchase and monthly payments are affordable.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <br>
  "Over the past several years, economic growth factors, real estate market conditions and university enrollment growth have coalesced in a way that challenges our traditional methods of assuring the range of housing options that are necessary to support the university's academic mission," Johnson said.<br>
  <br>
  Joseph P. Mullinix, UC senior vice president for business and finance, added: "The university must explore a host of creative ideas for building and operating additional housing for all segments of our community, for fostering the development of third party housing, and for providing additional financing assistance to our faculty and staff in purchasing housing."<br>
  <br>
  Appointment of the task force is expected within the next several weeks.
