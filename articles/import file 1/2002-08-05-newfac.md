  Holger Schmidt studies the fundamental physics of optical interactions between light and matter, with applications in the development of novel electronic and photonic devices. His research interests include time-resolved laser spectroscopy of semiconductors and nanostructures; all-optical semiconductor devices; nonlinear optics; and quantum optics. Schmidt earned a diploma in physics from the University of Stuttgart, Germany, and M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from UC Santa Barbara. Before joining the UCSC faculty, he was a postdoctoral fellow in the semiconductor laser group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Since his arrival at UCSC in 2001, Schmidt has received a prestigious NSF CAREER Award (a five-year grant from the National Science Foundation).
