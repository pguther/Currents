<p>
  Members of the UCSC community gathered on Wednesday, September 11, in the Upper Quarry Amphitheater for a noon-hour ceremony honoring the many people who died in New York, Washington, and Pennsylvania a year earlier.
</p>
<p>
  Firefighters from the campus department stood at attention as participants "wove" strips of colored cloth--inscribed with personal reflections--into a large "loom" structure, to create a commemorative tapestry.
</p>
<p>
  Violinist Michelle Witt, from Arts &amp; Lectures, performed during the weaving ceremony, and fire captain Mike Quinton's tolling of a ceremonial Indonesian gong closed the event.
</p>
<p>
  Comments such as "Gone but not forgotten, Peace for all!" and "May the love and strength we show each other continue to grow, may the Lord keep us all safe" were among the messages.<br>
</p>
<p>
  On September 26, Terry Burke, Paul Lubeck, and Alan Richards will participate in a discussion, "The U.S., the Middle East and the World Since 9/11: Critical Perspectives."
</p>
<p>
  The event, from 7 to 9 p.m. in Classroom Unit 2, is sponsored by the Ad Hoc Faculty Committee on Current Events, the Center for Justice, Tolerance, and Community, Colleges Nine and Ten, the Center for Global, International, and Regional Studies, the Center for Cultural Studies, and the Institute for Humanities Research.
