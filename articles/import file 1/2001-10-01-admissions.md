  <font size="5"><b>UC dual admissions implementation delayed</b></font><br>
  <br>
  The dual admissions plan for the University of California has been delayed due to a lack of additional funds from the Legislature.<br>
  <br>
  "In our discussions about the dual admissions proposal I indicated to the Regents and the faculty that we would not proceed with the program unless we received sufficient incremental funding from the state," UC President Richard C. Atkinson wrote in a letter to the Regents on September 20. "Unfortunately, despite strong indications that legislation would be passed to support the program, the Legislature has now recessed and funding did not materialize because of the state's fiscal difficulties."<br>
  <br>
  Under the new policy, students between the top 4 percent and 12.5 percent of the class in each California high school, based on grades in UC-required courses, will be granted UC eligibility and admission provided they complete a transfer program at a California community college.<br>
  <br>
  Students in their senior year of high school would receive both an admission offer from a community college and a provisional admission offer from a UC campus, conditioned upon the student's satisfactory completion of lower-division work at the community college. After fulfilling their freshman and sophomore requirements at the community college, these students will complete their upper-division studies at the UC campus and receive a UC degree.<br>
  <br>
  The Regents had <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/currents/01-02/07-23/admissions.html">approved</a> the change on July 19. <b><br></b><br>
