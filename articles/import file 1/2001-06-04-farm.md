  Once you've tasted the UCSC Farm's fresh organic strawberries, those conventionally grown berries just don't compare. But you'll have to shop early at the campus's popular market cart, which opens on Tuesday, June 12, because the fields are just getting going, and there are never enough strawberries to go around. But that's okay, because the bounty of the Farm is vast, and the cart will be overflowing with fresh organic produce and lovely flower bouquets each Tuesday and Friday afternoon from noon until 6 p.m. The cart is located in front of the Barn Theater at the intersection of Bay and High Streets. The early-season selection includes beets, carrots, leeks, potatoes, lettuces, spinach, and chard. And the array of fruits and vegetables gets even better as the growing season progresses. Regular patrons know that summer brings sweet corn, dry-farmed tomatoes, a colorful show of sweet and hot peppers, and more. The cart will be open through the summer and into the fall. All proceeds benefit the UCSC Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems' apprenticeship program in ecological horticulture. For more information, call (831) 459-3248.
