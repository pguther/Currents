<p>
  <i>The following letter was written in response to an <a href="../04-23/plaza.html">article</a> in Currents Online on a meeting held to discuss a proposal for a campus student union in the Bay Tree Bookstore/Graduate Commons area.</i>
</p>
<p>
  I think it is a good idea for the student union to be in a more central location. However if a new building is needed, I think construction should begin in 5 years when the students who have had to put up with the bookstore construction are gone. Let the new bookstore be enjoyed for a few years without construction going on.<br>
  <br>
  Thank you<br>
