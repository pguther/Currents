  <br>
  A new child care facilities initiative, launched by University of<br>
  California President Richard C. Atkinson, will expand the services<br>
  available to students, faculty, and staff on UC campuses.<br>
  <br>
</p>Through the matching-fund proposal, which taps non-state funds through the Office of the President (the University of California's systemwide office), Atkinson hopes to begin to meet demand estimated by a recent UC report to be more than twice the number of spaces available.<br>
<br>
"High-quality, accessible, and affordable child care is a critical priority that addresses the work and life needs of all members of the university community," Atkinson said.<br>
<br>
"With the university facing dramatic growth of students in the next 10<br>
years, this new proposal will support our efforts to recruit and retain a<br>
high-quality and diverse faculty and staff workforce," said Lubbe Levin,<br>
assistant vice president of policy, planning, and research at the UC Office of the President.<br>
<br>
"The program will provide better access to child care services for faculty,<br>
staff, and students and will be especially beneficial for women, who<br>
traditionally bear the most responsibility for children," Levin said.<br>
<br>
Each campus is invited to choose one of three suggested options that best<br>
suits its needs. Campus funds of $1 million, $1.5 million, and $2 million<br>
will be matched, respectively, by UCOP matching funds of $750,000, $1 million, and $1.25 million.<br>
<br>
Improvements in campus child care services and facilities have wide systemwide support. In July 1999, the university's Academic Council recommended that UC adopt a policy on child care following the development of a proposal from the University Committee on Faculty Welfare.<br>
<br>
In response to the Academic Council's request, a Child Care Policy and Programs Task Force was created with representation from students, staff, and faculty across the system. The task force's recommendation that child care be viewed as a strategic priority was adopted last year by Atkinson and the chancellors of the 10-campus UC system.<br>
