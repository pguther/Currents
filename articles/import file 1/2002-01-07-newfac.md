David Draper is a statistician who uses Bayesian methods to address problems such as how to assess the quality of hospitals, schools, and universities, and how to evaluate the risks of nuclear waste disposal. He is president-elect of the International Society for Bayesian Analysis, and will serve as president in 2002. Draper is chair of the newly forming Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics in the Baskin School of Engineering. He received his B.Sc. in mathematics from the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, and his Ph.D. in statistics from UC Berkeley. In 1984, while teaching at the University of Chicago, he received the Quantrell Award for Excellence in Undergraduate Teaching. Before joining the UCSC faculty, Draper was a professor of mathematical sciences and head of the statistics group at the University of Bath in England.
