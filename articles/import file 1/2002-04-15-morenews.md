  <a name="UCSC" id="UCSC"></a><font color="#003399">UCSC alum pledges major gift to library</font>
</h3>
<p>
  A UCSC alum has pledged a major gift to the library--but even he doesn't yet know just how big that gift might be.
</p>
<p>
  Michael Graydon (Cowell '70), an investor in New York City, has pledged $30,000 and invested two-thirds of the gift. If the market goes up over the next eight months, the library reaps a bonus. Graydon's pledge also stipulates his total donation will be no less than the original $30,000 gift.
</p>
<p>
  The new endowment will benefit the reference collection at McHenry Library. "The reference desk is a terrific place that provides vital services," said Graydon. Reference collections are a library's essential core, critical for public service, and the usual first stop of library patrons with a research question.
</p>
<p>
  "The Graydon gift recognizes the distinctive quality of reference collections as a gateway to the world of scholarly knowledge," said Frank Gravier, head reference librarian at McHenry Library. Keeping that gateway open and up-to-date is costly. Dictionaries and reference encyclopedia sets may cost up to several thousand dollars. In the future, these purchases can be supported by Graydon's gift.
</p>
<p>
  The endowment will be known as the Angie, Sally, and Melanie Graydon Reference Library Collection in honor of Graydon's mother, wife, and daughter. "These are people to whom I owe a great deal and who have a major impact on my life," said Graydon. "I've been fortunate. And I find no joy in good fortune unless it is shared."<br>
