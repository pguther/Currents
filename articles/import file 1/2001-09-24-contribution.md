  UCSC University Professional and Technical Employees executive board voted Wednesday, September 19, to donate $250 to the Communication Workers of America on behalf of possibly 400 CWA members who lost their lives at the World Trade Center.

  UPTE members systemwide are responding similarly. UCSC UPTE also voted to donate $100 to the Santa Cruz Firefighters Association to help in their efforts of raising money for the firefighters who lost their lives rescuing civilians at the WTC.<br>

  The CWA web site has coverage of the attacks and response by CWA members <a href="http://www.cwa-union.org/">http://www.cwa-union.org/</a>.
