  Current and prospective students will be joined by parents and alumni on Saturday, April 21 for UCSC's annual Banana Slug Spring Fair.<br>
  <br>
  An array of special events, including reunions for alumni and academic information fairs for prospective students, a student block party, dance performance, tours, and a nature walk, are on the schedule.

  Prospective students can take advantage of academic advising, attend workshops explaining UCSC's college system and financial aid, and attend a range of panel discussions. College tours get under way at 10 a.m. and continue until 3 p.m. (See <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/currents/00-01/03-12/fair.html">earlier story</a>.)
