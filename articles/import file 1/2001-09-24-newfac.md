She is particularly interested in the coupling of physical and biological processes. Dekshenieks uses numerical models to calculate the effects of physical changes in the marine environment on marine organisms. She also develops instruments and related software for collecting and visualizing oceanographic data in real time. Dekshenieks earned a B.A. in environmental sciences from the University of Virginia, an M.S. in biological oceanography from Old Dominion University, and a Ph.D. in physical oceanography from the Center for Coastal Physical Oceanography at Old Dominion University. Before joining the UCSC faculty, she spent two years as a postdoctoral researcher and two years as an assistant marine scientist at the University of Rhode Island.
