</h3>
<p>
  <img align="right" border="0" height="100" src="../art/bike2work.gif" width="130" alt="">Santa Cruz County <a href="http://www.bike2work.com/">Bike Week 2002</a> is May 12-18, and Bike to School/Work Day will be May 16.

A complete list of breakfast sites can be found by following the links on the web site.
</p>
<p>
  There will also be a commute race on May 14. The race will pit a cyclist against a car driver, a bus rider, and a bike-to-shuttle rider and will conclude at the UCSC Music Center Recital Hall. The goal of the race is to demonstrate how feasible--and quick-- it is to commute by bike to UCSC.

  <a name="Put" id="Put"></a><font color="#003399">Put a team together for the Prediction Run/Walk May 14</font>
</h3>
<p>
  Work out at a comfortable pace in a beautiful setting, get a free t-shirt, and win some not-so-fabulous prizes at the 15th annual Prediction Run/Walk on Tuesday, May 14, from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. at the East Field Track. The event is sponsored by OPERS, the Bay Tree Bookstore, and Human Resources.
</p>
<p>
  To participate, all you need to do is select your team (four staff/faculty members), name your team, estimate your time, and send in your entry form. Contact OPERS/Dan Wood at (831) 459-2531 if you do not have an entry form. <b>The entry deadline is May 7.</b>
</p>
<p>
  Each person on a team of four predicts his/her time to run or walk a distance of 1/2 mile at a comfortable pace. The captain of the team predicts how long, in minutes and seconds, the team will need to complete two miles (four 1/2 mile laps). During the relay, one person from the team will hand a baton to the next person. Participants do not have to run or walk fast to win the event; the closest actual time to the predicted time wins. Bring your own creative baton and leave your watches at work.<br>

  <a name="Work" id="Work"></a><font color="#003399">Work by faculty artist E. G. Crichton on display at Santa Cruz museum</font>
</h3>
<p>
  A video installation, entitled <i>In the Year of Her Age,</i> by E. G. Crichton, assistant professor of art, is on view at the <a href="http://www.santacruzmah.org">Santa Cruz Museum of Art and History</a> through July 21.<br>
  <br>
  Crichton developed <a href="http://www.santacruzmah.org/347_contemporary_configurations3.html"><i>In the Year of Her Age</i></a> from two research interests: a decade's worth of collected clapping chants, jump-rope rhymes, and the fortune-telling games of childhood, and a more recent interest in the inscriptions and forms of gravestones. Using video collages and text, Crichton mingles the repetitive singsong of children's rhymes with epitaph references, creating an installation that suggests memory, secrets, and cycles of time.<br>
  <br>
  Check the <a href="http://www.santacruzmah.org/2_visitor.html">museum's web site</a> for location and hours, or call (831) 429-1964.<br>
