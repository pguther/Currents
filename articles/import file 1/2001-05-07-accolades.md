<p>
  The Cancer Research Fund of the Damon Runyon-Walter Winchell Foundation has awarded a Runyon-Winchell postdoctoral fellowship to Robyn Hickerson. The three-year fellowship will support Hickerson's research in the laboratory of Harry Noller, Sinsheimer professor of molecular biology. This award is given to outstanding young scientists conducting theoretical and experimental research that is relevant to the study of cancer and the search for cancer causes, mechanisms, therapies, and prevention. Hickerson is studying the workings of the ribosome, a tiny molecular machine present in all cells that translates genes into proteins.
