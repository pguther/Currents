  The Columbia Scholastic Press Association (CSPA) has recognized <i>Leviathan</i> magazine for its excellence in journalism in its Annual Critique for 2000. CSPA is the leading authority on student publications all over the country. Each year CSPA receives thousands of entries from college publications all over the country and presents awards based on design, concept, content, individual accomplishment, and overall excellence. <i>Leviathan</i> received a Gold Medalist Certificate for overall excellence by earning a score of 977 out of a possible 1,000 points. The points earned are based on CSPA's judgment of various components of the magazine. In addition to this, the magazine also received two All-Columbia Honor Awards for concept and content. <i>Leviathan,</i> launched as a Jewish student publication, is now a magazine designed to provide all students with a forum for political expression. The content of <i>Leviathan</i> ranges from investigative articles to political essays to fiction and poetry. The staff consists of coeditors Bryan Shoffit and Aaron Selverston, along with approximately 15 student journalists and graphic artists. "We are definitely proud of our last issue," said Selverston<i>.</i> "But we are anticipating our next issue to be even better." The 2001 issue will be available on the UCSC campus and throughout Santa Cruz in April. Selverston can also be proud of receiving individual recognition from CSPA. Both he and Nikki Anderson received a Gold Circle Award for their work designing last year's cover.
