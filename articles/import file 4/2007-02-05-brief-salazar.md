  Author and media critic <a href="http://www.normansolomon.com/">Norman Solomon</a> will receive the third annual Ruben Salazar Journalism Award at 7 p.m. on Wednesday, February 7, in the College Nine/College Ten Multipurpose Room.
</p>
<p>
  A question-and-answer period will follow the event, which is free and open to the public.
</p>
<p>
  A nationally syndicated columnist on media and politics since 1992, Solomon has written 11 books. The latest, <i>War Made Easy: How Presidents and Pundits Keep Spinning Us to Death,</i> was published in July 2005. Solomon is also founding director of the <a href="http://accuracy.org/">Institute for Public Accuracy</a>, which facilitates communication between independent policy analysts and working journalists.
</p>
<p>
  The annual award honors the memory of independent journalist Ruben Salazar, who was killed during a Vietnam War protest in East Los Angeles when he was hit in the head by a police tear gas canister. Democracy Now! host Amy Goodman and cohost Juan Gonzalez are previous award winners.
</p>
