  A delegation of seven businesswomen from Santa Cruz's sister city of Alushta, Ukraine, got a look around the UCSC campus last week.
</p>
<p>
  Following a welcome session with Chancellor Denice D. Denton on Thursday, February 2, the group visited the Women's Center; met William Nickell, lecturer in Russian literature and language; and talked with students in the Stevenson College Fireside Lounge. The Music Center Recital Hall performance Friday by pianist Pablo Ziegler and the Trio for Nuevo Tango was also on their itinerary.
</p>
<p>
  Delegation members told Chancellor Denton that math and science classes in Ukrainian universities are made up mostly of women--the opposite of the American pattern. The top jobs, however, go mostly to men, they said.
</p>
<p>
  Delegation leader Olga Klymoyvich--like Chancellor Denton, an engineer--invited the chancellor to visit Ukraine. Chancellor Denton, who traces some of her family's roots to Bohemia, said she hopes to visit Ukraine, and encourage exchanges of students and faculty.
</p>
<p>
  The businesswomen were accompanied by Enda Brennan, chair of the Sister City Committee, and Nancy Eidam, committee vice chair, on their visit to campus. Accompanied by their interpreter, they are visiting Santa Cruz through February 15.
