  Drivers and passengers will get extra reminders to buckle up from May 15 through June 4, courtesy of the UCSC Police.
</p>
<p>
  UCSC's officers are joining local and state police in the nationwide "Click it or Ticket" campaign administered by the National Highway Traffic Safety campaign.
</p>
<p>
  A random sampling of vehicles will be checked before and after the campus enforcement effort to see if compliance has increased; a 2 percent boost in seat-belt usage is the goal. Last year, the compliance rate increased from 92 percent to 98 percent, so campus police are hoping for 100 percent compliance this year.
</p>
<p>
  Tickets for a first-offense seat-belt violation in Santa Cruz County are $101, with much higher fines if a vehicle is pulled over and a passenger under age 16 is unbuckled or improperly buckled.
</p>
<p>
  Campus police will also be participating on May 16 in a countywide enforcement campaign called BADGES, for "Before Aggressive Drivers Get Everybody Stopped." The focus will be on equipment violations, such as broken or nonfunctioning brake lights.
