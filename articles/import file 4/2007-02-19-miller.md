  Music professor Leta Miller has received a $24,000 fellowship from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) for a book project titled "San Francisco's Musical Life, 1906-45." The award was designated as a <i>We the People</i> grant--a special recognition given by the NEH for model projects that advance the study, teaching, and understanding of American history and culture.

  This project builds on Miller's research in mid-20th-century American experimental music over the last decade. She has published two books on composer Lou Harrison, as well as a critical edition of his works for <i>Music in the United States of America</i> (MUSA). Since 2000, Miller has also written more than a dozen articles on John Cage, Henry Cowell, Charles Ives, and others for such publications as <i>American Music, 20th-Century Music,</i> the <i>Journal of Musicology, Musical Quarterly,</i> and the <i>Journal of the American Musicological Society</i>. She is currently the executive director of the Arts Research Institute at UCSC.
