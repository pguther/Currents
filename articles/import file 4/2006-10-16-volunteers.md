<p>
  Students, staff, and faculty members wanting to help out in the community are invited to attend the annual Volunteer Fair from 12:30 to 4 p.m. on Thursday, October 19, in Quarry Plaza.
</p>
<p>
  The event is sponsored by the <a href="%3Chttp://volunteer.ucsc.edu%3E%20http://volunteer.ucsc.edu">Student Volunteer Center</a>, which matches students, staff, and faculty members with community needs.
</p>
<p>
  Representatives of off-campus community organizations will be available to provide information, and a marrow donor registration drive will also be conducted. People wanting to be entered into the National Marrow Donor Program registry may fill out a consent form and have a cheek swab sample taken (no blood sample is needed for the initial testing).<br>
  <br>
  Patients with life-threatening blood diseases such as leukemia and aplastic anemia, as well as certain immune system and genetic disorders, need someone to donate healthy marrow or blood stem cells.
