  Get out of the office for a few days this spring and spend some quality time with other UCSC staff women in a relaxing rural setting--and get paid to do it! The 20th annual <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/womenatwork">Women at Work Retreat</a> will be held this year on April 26 and 27 at the St. Francis Retreat Center in San Juan Bautista.
</p>

  The retreat will focus on building job-related skills, career development opportunities, and networking among campus staff. Space in available for 114 and the cost is $100 per person, including meals and overnight accommodations. Campus supervisors have been asked to provide release time and funding for those interested in attending. A limited number of partial or full scholarships are available.
