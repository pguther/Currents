  Keith Beauchamp, the filmmaker drawing acclaim for <i>The Untold Story of Emmett Louis Till,</i> and Angela Glover Blackwell, founder and CEO of the national advocacy group PolicyLink, will speak at UCSC's Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Convocation February 28.
</p>
<p>
  Held at the Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium, the annual convocation will begin at 7 p.m.
</p>
<p>
  Beauchamp's documentary focuses on the 1955 case in which a 14-year-old Chicago boy visiting relatives in Mississippi was murdered for whistling at a white woman in a store. The case is considered by many to be a turning point in the African American struggle for civil rights.
</p>
<p>
  Beauchamp will introduce his 70-minute film and answer questions at two free screenings. The on-campus screening will be at 7 p.m. February 27 in the UC Santa Cruz Media Theater; the downtown showing will be at noon on February 28, at the Del Mar Theater in Santa Cruz. Priority seating will be given to those with tickets. Ticket registration is available online at <a href="http://bas.ucsc.edu/events/">http://bas.ucsc.edu/events/</a> or by calling (831) 459-5003.
</p>
<p>
  Angela Glover Blackwell's wide-ranging PolicyLink organization has been active in the post-Hurricane Katrina rebuilding effort, stressing the importance of involving evacuees and residents in the rebuilding.
</p>
<p>
  At no charge, Policylink is consulting with the Louisiana Recovery Authority on housing and other rebuilding issues, and developing a media and communications strategy to connect displaced residents
</p>
<p>
  She is coauthor of the 2002 book <i>Searching for the Uncommon Common Ground: New Dimensions on Race in America</i> (W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2002). Blackwell's coauthors are Stewart Kwoh and Manuel Pastor, UCSC professor of Latin American and Latino studies, who will serve as emcee of the King convocation.
</p>
<p>
  In addition to UCSC, the 2006 Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Convocation is sponsored by the City of Santa Cruz, the <i>Santa Cruz Sentinel,</i> KUSP Radio, Inner Light Ministries, and the Santa Cruz Branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, or NAACP.
