  Gary Griggs, professor of Earth and planetary sciences, and architect Deepika Shrestha Ross will talk about their recent research on the physical evolution of the Santa Cruz coastline in a University Library Lecture on Tuesday, April 17. Their presentation will take place at 4 p.m. in Special Collections on the third floor of McHenry Library. Light refreshments will be available.

  Griggs and Ross will use specific examples from their new book, <i>Then &amp; Now: Santa Cruz Coast,</i> published by Arcadia Press (see <a href="http://press.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=946">earlier story</a>). They will examine the scientific and cultural impact of the natural erosion process and the effects of the changing coastline on the Santa Cruz community between Rio Del Mar and Davenport.
