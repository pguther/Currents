  Chancellor Denice D. Denton addressed diversity issues at two recent national conferences. Last week, she spoke on a panel at a conference on Women and Leadership at Stanford University. In January, she delivered the keynote address and served on a panel at a workshop in Arlington, Virginia, on women in chemistry.
</p>
<p>
  The January meeting, "Building Strong Academic Chemistry Departments Through Gender Equity," was sponsored by the National Science Foundation, Department of Energy, and National Institutes of Health. Joseph Konopelski, professor and chair of chemistry and biochemistry at UCSC, also participated in the conference, which involved 55 chemistry department chairs and 60 other academic, government, and national chemistry leaders.

  Recognizing the importance of a diverse workforce in maintaining the U.S. strength in science and engineering, the participants identified specific strategies that chemistry departments, universities, and federal agencies can implement to encourage and enable broader participation by women in academic chemistry departments.
