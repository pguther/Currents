  The Earth Sciences Department has changed its name to Earth and Planetary Sciences. The name change was officially approved on July 10 by David Kliger, campus provost and executive vice chancellor.

  The new name more accurately reflects faculty scholarship and long range plans, as well as the undergraduate and graduate curriculum of the department. There are no name changes to the department-sponsored majors and degree programs.
