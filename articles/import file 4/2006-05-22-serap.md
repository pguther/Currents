  The Student Employee Recognition Awards Program (SERAP) ceremony honored 270 students for their outstanding service to the university and academic excellence during the 2005-06 academic year. Student employees fill a variety of vital positions across the campus ranging from greeting campus visitors, gardening, and recycling, to accounting and helping faculty with their research.

  More than 500 people attended the May 12 event, including parents, siblings, supervisors, campus leaders, faculty, and staff. Employers gave their students certificates of appreciation and cash awards ranging from $100 to $2,000.
