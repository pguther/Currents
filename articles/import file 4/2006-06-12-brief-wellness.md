  The Wellness Center is gearing up for the new academic year by encouraging users to pay their exercising costs through payroll deduction.
</p>
<p>
  "The most economical option is to buy the annual pass through payroll deduction," said Katie Savacool, Reception Center Supervisor in the Office of Physical Education, Recreation and Sports.
</p>
<p>
  Staff and faculty may buy day passes, pay each quarter, pay annually, or sign up annually for payroll deduction. Those using payroll deduction get a price break, including a discount for summer quarter.
</p>
<p>
  Wellness Card sales for 2006-07 begin June 26. After that date, those using the Wellness Center will need to stop by the OPERS administration office on the second floor of the East Field House to have their cards updated. Forms authorizing payroll deduction for the Wellness Center are <a href="http://opers.ucsc.edu/opersadmin/payroll_deduction_form0607web.pdf">available online.</a>
</p>
<p>
  The Wellness Center will be closed June 16-18 and June 24-25, and open just from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. June 19-23 before beginning summer hours. (Hours of operation for OPERS facilities, including the swimming pool, are posted on the OPERS web site, <a href="http://opers.ucsc.edu/">http://opers.ucsc.edu/</a>.
