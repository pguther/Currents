<p>
  The UCSC Leadership Academy is seeking applicants for its six-month pilot program. The goal of the academy is to build a skilled, diverse pool of academic and staff employees with the knowledge and competencies to be successful in leadership roles at UCSC.
</p>
<p>
  The program hopes to attract a cross section of participants from the campus, with priority given to grades PSS L through MSP IV. Applications are due to the Training and Development Office by January 10.
</p>
<p>
  The pilot program will run from January through June. Each month includes a three-hour session with presentations, panel discussions, and case studies delivered by UCSC leaders and subject-matter experts, followed by a session later in the month dedicated to discussion, skills training, and networking.
</p>
<p>
  There will also be two full days of leadership-skills training and a full-day field trip to the Board of Regents meeting in San Francisco.
</p>
<p>
  Applicants must commit to the six-month curriculum; be able to thoughtfully contribute ideas and feedback for program revisions; and be open to serving as mentors for future programs.
</p>
<p>
  Following the pilot, the academy will be revised and launched to the campus community in fall 2007 and will include a mentoring component and team projects.
