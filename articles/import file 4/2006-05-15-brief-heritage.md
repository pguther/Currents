  Human rights activist Yuri Kochiyama will speak about her book, <i>Passing It On: A Memoir,</i> at the University of California, Santa Cruz, at 2 p.m. on Wednesday, May 17, at the Merrill Provost House.
</p>
<p>
  The book reception event celebrates and honors Kochiyama's extraordinary life and accomplishments. Her memoir coincides well with UCSC's Asian American/Pacific Islander Heritage Month theme, "Preparing Today for Tomorrow: Momentum for Movements." (See earlier <a href="http://currents.ucsc.edu/05-06/05-08/brief-trask.asp">Currents story.</a>) The event is free and open to the public.<br>
  <br>
  Later in the month, traditional and contemporary cultural identities will be highlighted through music, poetry, dance, theater, and food. The Cultural Showcase will take place from 6 to 8 p.m. on Wednesday, May 31, at the College Nine/College Ten Multipurpose Room.
