  The UCSC Women's Rugby Team won the Division II National Collegiate Championships in convincing fashion on Saturday, at Stanford's Steuber Rugby Stadium.

<p>
  The 22-10 victory capped an undefeated season in which the Banana Slugs dominated league play, then went 4-0 in playoffs. The team has gone 18-2 the last three years against Division II opponents. A rally to honor the team will take place Friday at 12:30 p.m. on the grass triangle outside the main campus pool.<br>
