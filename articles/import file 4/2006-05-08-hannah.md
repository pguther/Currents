  Art lecturer Hanna Hannah has been selected for a Rydell Visual Arts Fellowship for 2007. She is one of four local visual artists who will receive $20,000 grants from the Community Foundation of Santa Cruz County in 2006-07 as the first recipients of the Rydell Fellowships.
</p>
<p>
  Developed by the Community Foundation with input from the local arts community, the new award was created to honor the wishes of Roy and Frances Rydell, both lifelong advocates of the arts. They established the Roy and Frances Rydell Visual Arts Fund at the foundation in 1985 to promote Santa Cruz County artists and arts organizations.
</p>
<p>
  A panel of three nationally recognized arts professionals judged the artists' works to select the fellowship recipients. The panel members were Courtney Fink, executive director, Southern Exposure Gallery, San Francisco; Rita Gonzalez, assistant curator and special assistant to the deputy director at the Center for Art of the Americas, Los Angeles County Museum of Art; and James Benson, associate director and chief curator of The Contemporary Museum in Honolulu.
</p>
<p>
  Hannah has exhibited since the late 1970s, and her solo exhibits include the Schmidt/Dean in Philadelphia; Braunstein Gallery, San Francisco; and Miami University Art Museum, Ohio. Hannah's group shows include the Palo Alto Art Center History's Mirror; ef Gallery, Tokyo, Collapsing Histories; Geoffrey Young Gallery in Great Barrington, Massachusetts, For the Birds; Philadelphia Art Alliance, Articles of Faith; and Las Vegas Art Museum, Works on Paper.
</p>
<p>
  Hannah's work can be found in collections at the Miami University Museum, Oxford, OH; Museum of Art and History, Santa Cruz; and the Palace of the Legion of Honor (Achenbach Foundation), San Francisco. Her art has been covered in various publications, including <i>Artforum</i> magazine, the <i>Philadelphia Inquirer, San Francisco Chronicle, San Francisco Examiner, Oakland Tribune</i>, and <i>Artweek</i>. Hannah has an M.A. in French studies from Tufts University, and an M.F.A. from the San Francisco Art Institute.
