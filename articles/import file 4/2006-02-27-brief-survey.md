<p>
  Ecology Action is partnering with the United Way of Santa Cruz to frame community natural environment goals for 2010. Residents of Santa Cruz County are invited to be part of this goal-setting process by filling out an <a href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/s.asp?u=746711782140">online survey</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The survey allows each participant to enter up to three goals for the county's natural environment and to log on again with more if they wish. Once the goals are set, collaborative action plans are set by community organizations to achieve them.
</p>
<p>
  The survey is part of the larger <a href="http://www.appliedsurveyresearch.org/cap_report.htm">Community Assessment Project</a>, conducted by United Way of Santa Cruz County.
