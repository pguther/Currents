  The Dr. Earl H. Myers and Ethel M. Myers Oceanographic and Marine Biology Trust of Pebble Beach has granted $13,300 to nine UCSC students who conduct marine-related research.
</p>
<p>
  Each year the trust supports the work of outstanding student researchers in the Monterey Bay Area. The trust was established by the estates of Earl H. Myers, an internationally known oceanographic biologist at Stanford University's Hopkins Marine Station who died in 1975, and his wife and research assistant Ethel M. Myers, who died in 1985.
</p>
<p>
  The awards include the Ferd Ruth Award, established in honor of the late Ferd Ruth and given this year to UCSC student Matt Bromage. Ferd Ruth and his son Steve have managed the Myers Trust since its inception.
</p>
<p>
  This year's awards, which range from $1,000 to $2,900, went to the following graduate students:
