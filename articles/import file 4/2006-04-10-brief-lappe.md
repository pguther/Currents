  If Santa Cruz is the heart of the alternative foods movement, it will welcome one of its own on April 17 when author Anna Lappe comes to town.
</p>
<p>
  Lappe, daughter of "small planet" food guru Frances Moore Lappe, will give a free public talk on Monday, April 17, at 7 p.m. in Classroom Unit 2 at UCSC. Her visit, part of the Education for Sustainable Living Program's Spring Lecture Series, is being sponsored in part by the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems.
</p>
<p>
  Lappe is coauthor with chef Bryant Terry of the new book, <i>Grub: Ideas for an Urban Organic Kitchen</i> (Tarcher/Penguin 2006), which offers readers ideas and hands-on tools and menus to create healthy lives for themselves and their communities.
</p>
<p>
  Lappe's first book <i>Hope's Edge: The Next Diet for a Small Planet</i> (Tarcher/Penguin 2002), cowritten with her mother, chronicles social movements around the world that are addressing the root causes of hunger and poverty. Winner of the Nautilus Award for Social Change, <i>Hope's Edge</i> has been published in several languages and is used in classrooms across the country.
</p>
<p>
  Lappe and her mother, author of the groundbreaking book <i>Diet for a Small Planet</i>, lead the Cambridge-based Small Planet Institute, a collaborative network for research and popular education, and the Small Planet Fund, which has raised more than $250,000 for democratic social movements worldwide since 2002.
</p>
<p>
  Lappe has contributed to a number of books, including <i>Feeding the Future: How the Battle Over Food Will Change Your Life</i>. She is a board member of the Center for Media and Democracy and was named one of the country's leading environmental changemakers by <i>Organic Style</i> magazine. She holds an M.A. in economic and political development from Columbia University's School of International and Public Affairs. She is currently a Food and Society Policy Fellow, a national program of the W.K. Kellogg Foundation. She lives in Brooklyn, N.Y.
