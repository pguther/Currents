<p>
  UCSC Extension English Language and International Programs is seeking faculty and staff members interested in serving as host families for international students.
</p>
<p>
  Hosts get to know students from all over the world, learning about new cultures and perspectives, and often forming lasting friendships.
</p>
<p>
  Hosts are paid about $800 a month for their service as a host family, and may contact a local homestay coordinator with any questions or issues that arise.
