  "Reconstructing 100 Million Years of Human Evolutionary History" is the title of the Fall Synergy Lecture by David Haussler, professor of biomolecular engineering. The talk will take place on Tuesday, October 17, at 4 p.m. in the Current Periodicals Room of the Science &amp; Engineering Library.
</p>
<p>
  Haussler is a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator and director of the Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering at UCSC. He is involved in broad international efforts in genomic research aimed at discovering and characterizing all regions of the human genome that are crucial to biological function.
</p>
<p>
  In this lecture he will discuss his current work on reconstructing the genome of the common ancestor of all placental mammals. From this genome reconstruction, scientists hope to be able to document most of the genomic changes that occurred in the evolution of the human lineage over the past 100 million years. Understanding these changes promises insights into human health and disease. Haussler's talk will highlight some of his recent findings.
