  For nine years, the New Teacher Center (NTC) has brought together hundreds of educators from across the country each February to discuss the preparation of new teachers and what they need to be successful in the classroom.
</p>
<p>
  This year, the annual symposium takes place February 5-6 at the Fairmont Hotel in San Jose, with a preconference February 4. Sessions will focus on three themes: quality mentoring, leadership and professional identity, and equitable learning and social justice.
</p>
<p>
  Organizers expect more than 1,000 attendees from over 40 states and several countries to gather this year. UCSC Acting Chancellor George Blumenthal will give the welcoming address on February 5.

  The NTC links policy, practice, and research to support beginning teachers and administrators. Presenters will highlight programs, systems, and research from a variety of educational contexts and perspectives.

  Keynote speakers include Eugene Garcia, former dean of social sciences at UCSC, who is currently vice president for education partnerships with the Mary Lou Fulton College of Education at Arizona State University. Other keynote speakers are Lee Shulman, president of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, and mountaineer Stacy Allison, the first American woman to stand on top of Mt. Everest.
