<p>
  Sitar virtuoso Nishat Khan will perform in concert on Saturday, April 8, at 7:30 p.m. in the Music Center Recital Hall.
</p>
<p>
  The event is part of UCSC's ongoing Indian classical music series. Khan will be joined by noted tabla artist Abhijit Banerjee.
</p>
<p>
  Heir to one of India's most renowned musical families, Khan has been compared to Jimi Hendrix (<i>Chicago Sun-Times</i>) and J. S. Bach (<i>Washington Times</i>) because of the ingenious, highly personal interpretation of his musical heritage. Undeniably one of the foremost virtuosos of the sitar, Khan transcends all musical barriers with his provocative emotional expression and supreme technical mastery.
</p>
<p>
  Khan's extraordinary creativity is not bound by conservative orthodoxy--he has mastered not only the North Indian classical idiom but also realms as diverse as Gregorian chant, Western classical music, abstract jazz, and Flamenco. His sensitive phrasing and intuitive grasp of various musical cultures has led to collaborations with such renowned performers and composers as John McLaughlin, Philip Glass, Paco Pena, Evelyn Glennie, and Django Bates.
</p>
<p>
  Khan has been honored with numerous awards, including a U.S. Congressional Award for Contribution to Culture and Community in 2005. Khan was also invited to perform in 2004 alongside Eric Clapton, Carlos Santana, Jeff Beck, John McLaughlin, and others at the Crossroads Festival in Dallas, Texas.
