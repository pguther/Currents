  Assistant professor of theater arts Alma Martinez will appear in the Bay Area premiere of Nilo Cruz's 2003 Pulitzer Prize-winning play <i>Anna in the Tropics</i>, opening March 11 at Theatre Works in Palo Alto.
</p>
<p>
  Martinez will be reprising the role of "Ofelia," a role she played opposite Jimmy Smits (<i>West Wing, Star Wars</i>) and Herbert Siguenza (<i>Culture Clash</i>) last summer for an L.A. Theatre Works radio play presented on NPR. A CD of the play can be purchased through the L.A. Theatre Works website at: <a href="http://www.latw.org">www.latw.org</a>.

  Last spring, Martinez performed in the West Coast premiere of <i>Electricidad</i> by McArthur Award-winner Luis Alfaro at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles. That production--including a photo of Martinez--is featured in a cover story in this month's issue of <i>American Theatre Magazine</i>, the premiere professional theatre publication in the country. Martinez' picture is also featured on the book cover of a new anthology of plays just published by Luis Valdez titled <i>Mummified Deer and Other Plays</i>. She played the lead character in the world premiere of <i>Mummified Deer</i>, also directed by Valdez.
