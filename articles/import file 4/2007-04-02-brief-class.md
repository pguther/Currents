  The <a href="http://ucscrecreation.com/">Recreation Department</a> is offering a weekend Wilderness First Aid class April 14-15. Instruction and certification will be provided by the Wilderness Medicine Institute (WMI) of the National Outdoor Leadership School (NOLS).
</p>
<p>
  Fast-paced and hands-on, this course covers a wide range of wilderness medicine topics for people who travel in the outdoors. It is ideal for trip leaders, camp staff, outdoor enthusiasts, and individuals in remote locations.

<p>
  WMI's curriculum is unique and includes many advanced topics that other programs leave out such as dislocation reduction, focused spinal assessment, and epinephrine administration.

  WMI's course is pre-approved by such organizations as the American Camping Association, the United States Forest Service, and other governmental agencies. This course may also be used to recertify Wilderness First Responders - go to <a href="http://www.ucscrecreation.com">www.ucscrecreation.com</a> for more information on this.
