  UCSC's <a href="http://danm.ucsc.edu">Digital Arts and New Media (DANM) program</a> is at the forefront of a new discipline that merges the creative and academic potential of digital media and emerging art forms in exciting and unfamiliar ways. DANM was established in 2004 to address the increasingly central role of digital technology in the arts and to examine the impact of digital arts on culture. The program offers a two-year M.F.A. program that brings together students and faculty from across the art and academic spectra to collaborate on artistic practice and scholarly research.
