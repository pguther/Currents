  UCSC's Arts &amp; Lectures, in cooperation with the Theater Arts Department, will present the world premiere of Ben Munisteri Dance Projects' <i>Terra Nova</i>, this Friday and Saturday evening, April 13 and 14, at the UCSC Mainstage Theater. The shows begin at 8 p.m.
</p>
<p>
  <i>Terra Nova</i> melds choreography, computer animation, and motion-capture technology into a landscape of moving images and ideas. Choreographed by Ben Munisteri under the creative direction of assistant UCSC theater arts professor Ted Warburton, the productions also feature computer animation by New York University's Peter Birdsall, plus lighting design by David Cuthbert, and set design by Kate Edmunds--both UCSC assistant theater arts professors.
</p>
<p>
  Munisteri has recently been hailed by the <i>New York Times</i> for his originality and new perspective on contemporary dance. The <i>Cincinnati Enquirer</i> has described his work as "wildly engaging" adding that, "Munisteri's dances are full-bodied choreographic feasts." These performances are funded in part by the National Endowment for the Arts, the National Science Foundation, and the UCSC Arts Research Institute.
