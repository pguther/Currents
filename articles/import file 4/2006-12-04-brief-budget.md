  Five years ago the Planning and Budget Office undertook a project to provide easy access to budget and institutional data. The result was the online book staff named "A Bird's Eye View." It provides information on the permanent operating budget for the campus and each of its major units as well as recent data on degrees conferred, the majors of our students, the number of faculty budgeted in each department, student enrollments by department, and extramural awards.

  On the fifth anniversary of the Bird's Eye View, the Planning and Budget Office is pleased to provide the campus with <a href="http://planning.ucsc.edu/budget/reports/birdseye"><i>The UC Santa Cruz Budget: A Bird's Eye View, 2006-07</i></a>.
