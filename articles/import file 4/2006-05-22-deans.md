  UCSC has appointed deans to head two academic divisions: Stephen Thorsett has been named dean of the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences, and Georges Van Den Abbeele has been named dean of the Division of Humanities. The UC Board of Regents approved the appointments on May 18, effective July 1.

  Thorsett, a professor of astronomy and astrophysics, has served as acting dean of physical and biological sciences since 2005, when the previous dean, David Kliger, was appointed campus provost and executive vice chancellor.
