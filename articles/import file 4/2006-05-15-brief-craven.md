  The Arboretum begins a second season of the Third Thursday Music Series on May 18 with a performance by the Joe Craven Trio. The concert starts at 6:30 p.m. at the Dean McHenry Amphitheater on the grounds of the Arboretum.

  Joe Craven wears many hats and plays many things. For almost 17 years, he was the highly respected multi-instrumentalist with the David Grisman Quintet. He has played with Jerry Garcia, Stephane Grappelli, Ramblin' Jack Elliott, Psychograss, Darol Anger, Ken Nordine, and many others. Craven's recently released album <i>Django Latino</i>, which showcases melodies by two of the most significant musicians of 20th-century string jazz within a landscape of cumbia, merengue, samba, tango, and Latin jazz, is getting rave reviews.
