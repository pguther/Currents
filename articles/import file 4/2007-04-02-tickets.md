  A spirit of cooperation filled the air as representatives of Santa Cruz and UCSC gathered to celebrate the debut of a joint ticketing system for campus, Civic Auditorium, and community events.
</p>
<p>
  "This proves we really can make beautiful music together when we want to," said Acting Chancellor George Blumenthal at the March 28 reception in the Civic Auditorium lobby.
</p>
<p>
  The new system--Santa Cruz Tickets--is a comprehensive community ticket office from which patrons can buy tickets to most local performances and events through one source, either online at <a href="http://santacruztickets.com">santacruztickets.com</a>, in person at the City's Civic Auditorium Box Office, or the UCSC Ticket Office. (See <a href="http://press.ucsc.edu//text.asp?pid=1085">press release</a>)
</p>
<p>
  Santa Cruz Mayor Emily Reilly said the idea of forming a joint ticketing operation "is one of those things that seems like a simple thing." Putting it all together was a difficult project, however, involving about 30 people, she said.
</p>
<p>
  "This would not have happened without every link in the chain saying 'we can do this.' " Reilly added that special thanks should go to city staffers Shannon Toombs and Andy Botsford.
</p>
<p>
  "A lot of people worked above and beyond the call of duty," Blumenthal said, recognizing UCSC staff members Luisa Cardoza and Jessi Bond in particular for their work on the project.
