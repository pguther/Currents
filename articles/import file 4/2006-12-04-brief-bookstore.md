  Finish your holiday shopping right here on campus. The Bay Tree Bookstore will hold its annual Holiday Staff and Faculty Appreciation Open House on December 13 from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. The event will feature 20 percent off all UCSC and Slug apparel, insignia, and seasonal gift items. The bookstore has a great selection of UCSC ornaments this year sure to please all your campus fans and alums.

  There will be 20 percent off children's books, 2007 calendars, and all general fiction at the open house and continuing until the campus closes at the end of the day December 22. Hardback books are always discounted 20 percent. Discounts are not applicable on previously marked down items or textbooks.

  The Computer Department will be raffling off a new Apple iPod Shuffle, and there are some terrific deals on "End Of Life" Intel Duo Core MacBooks (still a great holiday gift item!) while supplies last. Be sure to check on other great holiday offers from Apple and the Bay Tree Computer Department.

  Light refreshments will be served throughout the day.
