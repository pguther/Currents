  Associate professor of history Lisbeth Haas has been awarded two research grants for this coming academic year. She received $3,000 from a University of Houston-based grant program titled "Recovering the U.S. Hispanic Literary Project," to facilitate research on her book-in-progress titled "Indigenous Histories of Colonial and Mexican California<i>."</i> Haas will use the funds to travel to an archive in Bologna, Italy, to study a 19th-century manuscript and then to southern California to work with native Luisenos and a linguist on their interpretation of the manuscript.

  She also received a $1,500 seed grant from UC MEXUS to work on a project titled "Across Borders: Transnational Economies and Regional Histories in the Americas." Haas will examine the 20th-century histories of regions of the United States and Mexico deeply affected by globalization. Her work will focus on places such as Independence, Galax, Hillsville, and Friis in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Southwestern Virginia that had highly populated towns with factories that specialized in textiles, furniture, and mining for much of the 20th century.
