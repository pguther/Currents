  The Center for World History is presenting a lecture series this winter and spring titled "Itineraries in the Muslim Mediterranean, 1350-1950: Individuals, Change and Memory in a World Region." The lectures are open to the public and are intended to make available different perspectives on the transformation of the Muslim Mediterranean in modern times.
</p>
<p>
  The series will explore the transformation of the Muslim culture zone in the Mediterranean from the 14th to the 20th Centuries as seen through the lives of six notable men and women, Muslim and non-Muslim. The lectures begin with a talk on January 23 by UCSC history professor Terry Burke. The complete schedule is listed below.
