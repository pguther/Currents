  Former UCSC chancellor Karl Pister and UCSC professor Michael Cowan have received the 2006 Oliver Johnson Award for Distinguished Service in the Academic Senate.
</p>
<p>
  The awards are given in memory of longtime Senate activist Oliver Johnson to honor demonstrated outstanding and creative contributions to shared governance at the divisional and systemwide level.
</p>
<p>
  Prior to serving as UCSC chancellor from 1991 to 1996, Pister spent 45 years at UC Berkeley as a professor in the College of Engineering and as an academic administrator. He served as dean of the college from 1980 until 1990. Pister began his Senate service the same year he joined the UC Berkeley faculty, 1952. He served for several years on Berkeley's Educational Policy Committee and the Universitywide Committee on Educational Policy, before becoming systemwide Senate chair in 1979.

  Cowan, a professor of American studies and literature and senior adviser to the chancellor, has served on numerous committees and task forces of the Academic Senate.
</p>
<p>
  He began serving on Senate committees in 1969, his first year at UCSC, and was the only person to serve twice as chair of the UCSC Academic Senate, from 1979 to 1980 and from 1994 to 1996. He worked closely with the administration on divisional and systemwide planning and budget committees before becoming Universitywide Academic Senate chair in 2000. In 1997, Cowan received the first Dean McHenry Award for Distinguished Leadership, given by the UCSC Academic Senate to acknowledge outstanding service.
