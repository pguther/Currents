  The UCSC Library is celebrating the 25th anniversary of Shakespeare Santa Cruz (SCC) with an exhibit highlighting some of the beautiful and unique Shakespearean materials from the library's collections.
</p>
<p>
  The show, titled "Oh Wonderful, Wonderful... Celebrating Shakespeare at the Library" runs through September 15.
</p>
<p>
  A <a href="http://library.ucsc.edu/ref/shakespeare/">web site</a> has also been developed to accompany the exhibit, with descriptions of the displayed materials, links to related Shakespeare web sites, as well as images of 25 years of Shakespeare Santa Cruz posters.
</p>
<p>
  The central exhibit is located on the main floor of McHenry Library. Eight cases are filled with Shakespeare materials from the library's collection, as well as some items from the SSC props and archival departments.
