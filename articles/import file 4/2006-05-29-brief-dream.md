  <i><b>Benjamin Britten's Opera Finds New Setting in Dali-esque Dreamscape</b></i>
</p>
<p>
  Each spring the UC Santa Cruz Music Department presents a fully staged opera complete with theatrical sets, professional costumes, top graduate and undergraduate singers from the department, and the 40-piece UCSC Orchestra expertly conducted by Professor <a href="http://www.nicolepaiement.com/">Nicole Paiement</a>.
</p>
<p>
  This season vocal instructor Brian Staufenbiel returns to direct Benjamin Britten's entrancing English language opera <i>A Midsummer Night's Dream</i> (first performed in England in 1960) with libretto by the composer and Peter Pears in an adaptation of Shakespeare's famous play. The opera will be performed in English with supertitles.
</p>
<p>
  Staufenbiel and his expert design team have invented a postmodern midsummer night's dreamscape in which strange fairies roam the streets, and kings and queens rule a Dali-esque urban land. The same design team that brought you <i>Don Giovanni</i> in 2005 and <i>Street Scene</i> in 2004 is back again with lighting design by Sylvie Vray, scenic design by Legend Theatrical, costume design by Marti Kranak, and wigs and make-up by Jeanna Hurd.
</p>
<p>
  Noted Shakespeare scholar and UCSC professor emeritus of literature Michael Warren will present a preconcert talk, titled "Britten and <i>A Midsummer Night's Dream</i>," on June 4 before the closing matinee. The Sunday talk begins at 12:45 p.m. in the Recital Hall. Tickets are required.
</p>
<p>
  <i>A Midsummer Night's Dream</i> plays Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, June 1, 2, and 3 at 7:30 p.m. and Sunday, June 4, at 2 p.m. in the Music Center Recital Hall. Seating is reserved. Tickets are available in advance at the UCSC Ticket Office: (831) 459-2159, $18, $14 seniors, $10 students with ID.
