  Tish Hinojosa has become one of the most acclaimed artists in the contemporary Latin and folk scene. With a purity of voice she embraces pop, rock, Tejano, and international styles.
</p>
<p>
  Born in San Antonio, the daughter of Mexican immigrants, Tish Hinojosa developed a borderless approach to music, incorporating elements of Mexican folk and country with contemporary pop and rock. Her 1989 debut album, <i>Homeland,</i> immediately put her on the international musical map. With her next release, <i>Culture Swing</i>, Hinojosa won the NAIRD Award for Best Folk Album. Over the eleven subsequent releases, countless tours of North and South America and Europe, Hinojosa developed a loyal audience. Her music and social activism on behalf of children, Latinas, and farm workers have won her numerous awards. In her latest release, <i>Heart Wide Open</i>, she continues to express her distinctive musical styles and background.
