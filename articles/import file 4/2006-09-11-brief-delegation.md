  Watsonville's sister city delegation from Pinghu, China, got a good look at an American university September 1 during a breakfast visit to University House followed by a campus tour.
</p>
<p>
  Acting Chancellor George Blumenthal welcomed the group, headed by Pinghu executive vice mayor Hu Shui Liang, to the campus.
</p>
<p>
  Blumenthal noted that UCSC faculty are now collaborating with Chinese researchers on 130 research projects and that as a faculty member he wrote papers with Chinese astronomers.
</p>
<p>
  Joining the delegation at the breakfast were Watsonville mayor Antonio Rivas, Cabrillo College president Brian King, and members of the Cabrillo College Board of Trustees.
</p>
<p>
  UCSC representatives included history professor Gail Hershetter, whose area of expertise includes modern Chinese social and cultural history; Kevin Browne, executive director of admissions and registrar and part of a UC delegation to China this summer; and David Keller, assistant director of residential and family services, also part of the UC delegation.
