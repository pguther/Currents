  A question-and-answer period will follow the event, which is free and open to the public.

  A nationally syndicated columnist on media and politics since 1992, Solomon has written 11 books. The latest, <em>War Made Easy: How Presidents and Pundits Keep Spinning Us to Death,</em> was published in July 2005.
