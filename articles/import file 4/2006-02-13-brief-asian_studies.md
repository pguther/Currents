  For years, UC Santa Cruz has been the only campus in the UC system without an Asian Pacific American studies program. Why has the effort failed? What intersecting issues of knowledge, politics, and power must be considered in any future development of Asian Pacific American studies at UCSC?

  Key players in the field will join students and faculty from UCSC to address these questions at "Inter-Disciplining Asia-Pacific-America: A Symposium on Knowledge, Politics, and the University" on Friday, February 17. The symposium will be held at the Bay Tree Building, Conference Room D, from 9:30 a.m. to 6 p.m.
