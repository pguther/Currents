<p>
  The UC Travel Council is asking travelers and travel coordinators to take a few minutes and complete a short online <a href="http://survey.chr.ucla.edu/research/tc0607sourc.htm">travel survey</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The UC Travel Council, working under the direction of UC senior management, is comprised of representatives from all 10 campuses and both labs. The Travel Council is designing a comprehensive travel management program for the UC system; negotiating new contracts for airfare, hotels, and car rentals; and exploring other tools that are easy to use and cost effective.
</p>
<p>
  Input from travelers and travel coordinators is essential to the success of this project. The answers to the survey questions will help the Travel Council design a management program that supports the needs of UC travelers, travel arrangers, and travel preparers.
</p>
<p>
  The online survey is available through December 1 at <a href="http://survey.chr.ucla.edu/research/tc0607sourc.htm">survey.chr.ucla.edu/research/tc0607sourc.htm</a>
