  Independent photojournalist Dahr Jamail returns to UC Santa Cruz to give an update on the current conditions on the ground in Iraq on January 24. His presentation is from 7 to 9 p.m. at the Cowell College Dining Hall.
</p>
<p>
  Jamail was last on campus in October 2005 for a lecture-slide presentation before a capacity crowd at the Music Recital Hall (see <a href="http://currents.ucsc.edu/05-06/10-24/journalist.asp"><i>Currents</i> story</a>).
</p>
<p>
  Jamail began reporting from Iraq in late 2003 in response to the failure of the U.S. media to accurately report on the realities of the war in Iraq for the Iraqi people and U.S. soldiers. His dispatches were quickly recognized as an important media resource. He is now writing for the Inter Press Service and the <i>Asia Times,</i> and he is a special correspondent for <i>Flashpoints</i> news radio. His reports have been published in the <i>Guardian, Independent</i>, and <i>Sunday Herald</i> (all U.K.), and the <i>Nation</i> magazine and heard on <i>Democracy Now!</i> and the BBC.

  Jamail's presentation is free and open to the public. Parking permits are required through 8:30 p.m. Visitors driving to campus may park in lot 109 (permits and maps available at the parking kiosk near the main entrance to campus).
