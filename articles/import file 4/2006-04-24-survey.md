  An online diversity survey, launched in February by the Academic Senate's Committee on Affirmative Action and Diversity (CAAD), produced a wealth of information about the diversity climate on campus--and a number of prizes for some of the students, staff, and faculty who took time to fill out the survey.
</p>
<p>
  Organizers of the survey have scheduled the last in a series of campus forums in mid-May to present highlights from the study. "In addition to sharing information on some of the findings, this meeting will help us to complete the final report, which we plan to make available before the end of the quarter," said Gina Dent, associate professor of feminist studies and former chair of CAAD.

  The forum will take place on May 16, from 4 to 6 p.m. in Bay Tree Conference D.

  Meanwhile, number of students, staff, and faculty were randomly selected to receive prizes for participating in the survey. The prize winners are:
