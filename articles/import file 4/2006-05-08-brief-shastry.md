  Sriram Shastry, professor of physics, is <a href="http://www.iop.org/EJ/journal/-page=featauth/-author=492/0305-4470/8">featured on a web site</a> of the Institute of Physics (IOP) called "60 Seconds with... Author's Edition." The site showcases interviews with authors who have published papers in IOP journals that were key to the advancement of physics research in their particular subject area.
</p>
<p>
  The interview with Shastry was prompted by a paper published in 2005 in the <i>Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and General</i> that addressed questions relating to "quantum integrable systems." The interview is wide-ranging, including questions such as "What book are you reading right now?" Shastry's answer: Jane Austen's <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>, "perhaps for the 20th time."
