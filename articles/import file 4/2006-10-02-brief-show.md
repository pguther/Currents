  The Smith Gallery has opened its 2006-07 exhibition season with "A Shout in the Street: Early Soviet Posters." Also on exhibit in the Smith's Annex Gallery is "Victory Over the Sun: El Lissitzky's Graphic Portfolio."
</p>
<p>
  The exhibitions are free and open to the public. Gallery hours are Tuesday through Sunday, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. The gallery is wheelchair accessible.
</p>
<p>
  "A Shout in the Street" presents a spectrum of bold,<br>
  beautifully designed posters, from revolutionary to<br>
  educational, and ranging in style from cartoonish to<br>
  abstract, constructivist, and avant-garde. Posters were a key art form in the Soviet idea of a mass, socialistic art, and the Russian Revolution of 1917 was a major event for artists.
</p>
<p>
  "Victory Over the Sun" was a scandalous show when it was presented in 1913 in St. Petersburg.<br>
  Following the Russian Revolution, in 1923, artist and architect El Lissitzky designed a series of lithographs for a so-called "electro-mechanical" staging of the opera. The Smith Gallery is displaying<br>
  the full series of El Lissitzky's graphic portfolio of<br>
  "Victory Over the Sun," along with some selected materials from last year's live staging of the play.
