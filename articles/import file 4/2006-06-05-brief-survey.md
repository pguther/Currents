  The second annual Business Operations survey has now been launched; faculty, staff, and students who have conducted business transactions of a purchasing, staff personnel, or accounting-related nature in the past year are requested to participate. The survey is short, and shouldn't take more than five minutes of your time. To participate, point your internet browser to <a href="http://survey.ucsc.edu/BAS/BUS_OPS">survey.ucsc.edu/BAS/BUS_OPS</a>.

  The survey asks you to rate the importance of various functions (e.g., that urgent matters are handled in one day, that advice is accurate, that online information is easy to access), and your satisfaction of how well those functions are currently being handled by three central offices: Purchasing, Staff Human Resources, and Financial Administrative Services Transactions office (or FAST). The results of this type of survey (often called importance-performance surveys) show the gaps between expectations and performance. This allows staff from the central organizations to quickly gauge their customers' satisfaction levels, and help determine how best to prioritize improvements to their systems and services.

  This is a follow-up survey to the one conducted shortly before the consolidation of service centers last spring. Results from last year's survey are posted at <a href="http://bas.ucsc.edu/performance">bas.ucsc.edu/performance</a>. This year's survey will run through June 30; results will be posted at that same web address by August 1. Questions about the survey can be directed to Susan Willats, BAS Office of Planning and Analysis, at (831) 459-3759 (or <a href="mailto:willats@ucsc.edu">willats@ucsc.edu</a>).
