  The government of India and universities from the United States and India have inaugurated an ambitious e-learning collaboration to enhance science and engineering education at Indian universities. The aim is to boost the supply of world-class engineers available for corporate and academic research in both countries.
</p>
<p>
  The president of India, APJ Abdul Kalam, participated in the network's launch in December, giving the inaugural lecture via satellite from New Delhi to students at a dozen far-flung Indian college campuses.

  Boosting engineering education in India--especially at second- and third-tier universities--would groom a more tech-savvy workforce for American R&amp;D operations in India and around the world. Three U.S.-based companies have already committed funding to the program, QUALCOMM, Microsoft, and Cadence Design Systems.

  The American universities involved are the University of California (Office of the President, UC San Diego, UC Berkeley, UCLA, and UC Santa Cruz), Calit2 and its sister institute CITRIS, Cornell, Carnegie Mellon, Case Western, State University of New York at Buffalo, Harvard, Princeton, Yale, Purdue, Georgia Tech, University of Massachusetts-Amherst, University of Washington, University of Texas-Austin, University of Wisconsin-Madison, University of North Dakota, University of Maryland, University of Michigan, and University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.<br>
