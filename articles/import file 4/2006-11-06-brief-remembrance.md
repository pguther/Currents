    caption: "A moment of remembrance was celebrated Friday afternoon for former Chancellor Denice D. Denton. Faye Crosby, chair of the Academic Senate, called the meditative interlude at the College Ten Namaste Lounge 'an unconventional ceremony for an unconventional woman.' The 30-minute pause from day-to-day activities featured Karlton Hester on flute and Patrice Wallace on bass, playing gently. It was one of several events sponsored by the Academic Senate and supported by the Chancellor's Office around the one-year anniversary of Chancellor Denton's investiture weekend. Acting Chancellor George Blumenthal remembered Chancellor Denton as a woman of extraordinary accomplishment and a mentor to many. Photo: Guy Lasnier"
