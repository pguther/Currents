  Non-represented staff employees will receive a $475 award this year, Willeen McQuitta, director of Staff Human Resources, announced in a <a href="http://shr.ucsc.edu/">memo</a> posted June 8. The award, which is part of the 2005-06 Staff Recognition and Development Program, will be given to all eligible staff on June 16.<br>
  <br>
  The memo outlined the eligibility criteria:
</p>
<p>
  * Employees are in title codes that are not exclusively represented.<br>
  <br>
  * Employees with career, partial-year career, by agreement, and limited appointments will receive the award based on their distribution percent time in the Payroll/Personnel System (PPS) in effect on June 1, 2006.<br>
</p>
<p>
  * Awards for part-time employees will be prorated, based on the employee's distribution percent. The minimum award will be $100.<br>
</p>
<p>
  * Employees must be on pay status for the period between January 1, 2006 and April 30, 2006 and must have received gross pay during this period.
