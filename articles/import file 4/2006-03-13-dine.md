  Michael Dine, professor of physics, will give a series of lectures on theoretical physics this month at the Technion (Israel Institute of Technology) in Haifa, Israel. Dine, a leading theoretical physicist, will give a Distinguished Lecture Series titled "Beyond the Standard Model: A Confrontation with Fundamental Questions." The series comprises three lectures and is sponsored by the Institute of Theoretical Physics at the Technion.

  Dine's research has addressed many of the questions left unanswered by the standard model of particle physics, including the nature of dark matter, the origin of the asymmetry between matter and antimatter, and the physics underlying cosmological inflation. He has been a leading figure in the exploration of string theory as a tool to understand the new physics beyond the standard model.
