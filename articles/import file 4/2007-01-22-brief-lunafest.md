  LUNAFEST, a fundraising film festival dedicated to promoting awareness about women's issues, highlighting women filmmakers, and bringing women together in their communities, will screen in Santa Cruz at the Rio Theater on Saturday, January 27.
</p>
<p>
  LUNAFEST films are pulled from the top festivals across the nation including Tribeca, the Los Angeles Short Film Festival, and London International Film Festival. This year's films range from animated shorts to fictional drama, and cover topics such as women's health, body image, spirituality, relationships, cultural diversity, and breaking barriers. See below for a brief description of each of the films.
</p>
<p>
  The doors open at 6:30 p.m. and the films will be shown from 7 to 9 p.m. The Rio Theater is located at 1207 Soquel Avenue in Santa Cruz.
