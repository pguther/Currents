  The Forest History Society and the American Society for Environmental History have named history professor Mark Cioc as the new editor of their jointly published journal, <i>Environmental History</i> (EH). Cioc assumed the editor-elect's duties on January 1 and will become editor on January 1, 2006, when Adam Rome of Pennsylvania State University steps down. Cioc's first journal issue will be January 2006.

  Cioc received a Ph.D. in history from UC Berkeley, in 1986. He served as assistant professor of history at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst from 1987 to 1989 before joining the UCSC faculty in 1989. He served as provost of Stevenson College from 1994 to 1998 and is currently the campus director of the UCDC Program.

  Cioc has been on the <i>Environmental History</i> journal's editorial board since 1993 and served as associate editor from 1996 to 2001. He is currently coediting an anthology: "How Green Were the Nazis?," which will be published by the Ohio University Press later this year and is finishing a book, entitled "The Game of Conservation: International Wildlife Treaties of the 20th Century." Cioc's most recent book <i>The Rhine: An Eco-Biography, 1815-2000</i>, was published in 2002 by the University of Washington Press.
