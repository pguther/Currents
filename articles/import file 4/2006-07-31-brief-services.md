<p>
  Beginning on August 7, the McHenry circulation desk will be the single service point for McHenry circulation, reserves, and interlibrary loan transactions.<br>
  <br>
  McHenry reserves, interlibrary loan, and circulation units have spent the last year preparing for the consolidation of the service desks. Staff members are trained on all three services and it is expected that patrons will benefit greatly from the ease of accessing all of our services at a single desk.<br>
  <br>
  A single telephone number, (831) 459-5185, now reaches all three services.
