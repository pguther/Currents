  UCSC researchers attracted a record $128.5 million in external grants and contracts to the campus in the 2005-06 fiscal year.
</p>
<p>
  The increase continues an upward trend in research funding at UCSC that has brought in almost half a billion dollars over the past five years.
</p>
<p>
  "UCSC's grants and contracts awards grew at the fastest annual pace ever experienced by any UC campus--a 28 percent increase," said William Clark, director of UCSC's Office of Sponsored Projects.
</p>
<p>
  "Each of the campus's five divisions grew, and some units more than doubled over the past year, including the Department of Computer Science and the New Teacher Center."
</p>
<p>
  More than 79 percent of awards were from the federal government. The single largest award was $23 million from NASA for the University Affiliated Research Center (UARC), located at NASA Ames Research Center. This also made NASA the largest funding source ($30.4 million), followed by the National Science Foundation ($25 million) and the National Institutes of Health ($20.8 million). The Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation ($4.7 million) was the largest private source of research funding.
