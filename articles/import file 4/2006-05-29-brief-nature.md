  The 67 artworks displayed in this year's exhibit depict everything from mammals to microbes in great detail using media ranging from colored pencil, scratchboard, coquille, watercolor, acrylic, and digital media.

  Graduates of the Science Illustration Program go on to illustrate for a variety of prestigious institutions and publications such as the <i>Smithsonian, National Geographic, Scientific American,</i> and the American Museum of Natural History. UCSC is one of the few universities in the U.S. with a specialized program in scientific illustration.<br>
