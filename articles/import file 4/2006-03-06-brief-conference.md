  UCSC's sixth annual Expanding Your Horizons Conference drew about 250 young women and adults to campus on March 4.
</p>
<p>
  The goal of the conferences, held throughout the United States, is to encourage young women to study math and science by showing the benefits of such education to their lives and by stimulating their interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics careers. The conference is open to young women in eighth through 12th grade as well as interested adults.
</p>
<p>
  UCSC Earth sciences lecturer and paleontologist Hilde Schwartz opened the gathering with a presentation called "The Long Neck, the Rex, and the Raven: How Dinosaurs Saved the World."
</p>
<p>
  Career workshops and hands-on science activities were held throughout the day, led by professional women, faculty, and graduate students in math, science, engineering, and medicine. UCSC Chancellor Denice D. Denton, a champion for women in math, science, and engineering careers, offered closing remarks, "Math and Science: Girls Rule."
