  Anyone with questions for Acting Chancellor George Blumenthal will have plenty of chances to speak up in October.

  In his first appearance at the <a href="http://sab.ucsc.edu">Staff Advisory Board's</a> Forum as acting chancellor on October 24, Blumenthal will offer an update on campus issues followed by questions.

<p>
  The board's fall-quarter forum will take place from 12:30 to 1:40 p.m. at the Stevenson Event Center. In addition to hearing from Acting Chancellor Blumenthal, those attending will also hear an update on the Staff Advisory Board. Refreshments will be provided.
