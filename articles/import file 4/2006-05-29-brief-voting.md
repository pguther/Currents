  Students voted to increase their transportation fees and establish a new intramural and sports club team activities fee in balloting May 17 through May 23. Proposals on renewable energy, recreation programs, and Seymour Marine Discovery Center also passed.
</p>
<p>
  A modification to the student voice and empowerment fee language failed, as did a UCSC athletics measure, and a graduate student government fee increase. (See earlier <a href="http://currents.ucsc.edu/05-06/05-15/brief-voting.asp"><i>Currents</i> article</a>)
</p>
<p>
  The fees must be approved by President Dynes before they become official.
</p>
<p>
  Student Union Assembly officers were also elected. Complete results will be posted online at <a href="http://elections.ucsc.edu/">elections.ucsc.edu/</a> once the SUA releases the tallies.<br>
