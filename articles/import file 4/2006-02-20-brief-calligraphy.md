  Learn the fundamentals of Shodo Japanese calligraphy, using traditional ink and brush. Shodo is a traditional art that is practiced by common people as well as by Zen and Shinto priests and artists. In Japan there is a saying: A person's writing shows their character. Shodo teaches you how to meditate and express your inner strength in your art and life. In this workshop, instructor Yoshi Shibatayou will start with the meditation of making ink, then continue on to learn basic strokes using a calligraphy brush. The class is February 23 from 7 to 10 p.m. at Bay Tree Conference Center, Room D. The cost is $15 for UCSC students and Wellness Card holders.<br>
