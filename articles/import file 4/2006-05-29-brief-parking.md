<p>
  Parking costs--from meters to annual permits and vanpools--are going up for 2006-07. The hourly rates on meters will increase by 25 cents per hour, the cost for all close-in annual and quarterly parking permits will rise by about 5 percent, scratch-off packets will cost about 5 percent more for the first and second packet (10 percent for the third), and vanpool rates will go up by 16 percent. <span class="style1">(The rate of increase for scratch-off packets was incorrectly stated as "about 12 percent" in the printed June <i>Currents</i> because of incorrect information provided<i>.</i>)</span>
</p>
<p>
  In addition, remote parking permits will increase by about 10 percent, and staff and faculty bus passes will go from $24 to $36 annually, with the exception of vanpool riders, who receive either a free packet of scratch-offs or a free bus pass.
</p>
<p>
  Those needing parking over the summer need to purchase permits by July 1.
</p>
<p>
  Students, staff, and faculty are encouraged to submit <a href="https://tapsosxserver.ucsc.edu/staff2006/sf2006.htm">online applications</a> to obtain 2006-07 parking permits.
</p>
<p>
  There will be some new parking permit options for 2006-07:
</p>
<p>
  * "A Limited Day" permits are now offered on an annual basis (July 1, 2006 through June 30, 2007) by payroll deduction to eligible faculty and staff. (Previously this type of permit had to be purchased quarterly.) Faculty and staff members who work a regular schedule of 1, 2, 3, or 4 days per week may purchase an "A Limited Day" permit. This permit is a good option for employees who work less than five days per week, and whose schedule remains the same from week to week.
</p>
<p>
  * For added convenience "A Carpool" permits are now available on a multiyear (nonexpiring) basis when all participants are career employees.
