  Start the year off right with a recreation activity. There are classes in a wide variety of interest areas, including surfing, backpacking, ski and snowshoe trips, kayaking, rock climbing, holistic health, wine tasting, cooking, music, dance, wilderness first aid and first responder, survival skills, spring break trips, and day hikes. The winter 2007 <i>Recreation, Intramural &amp; Sports Guide</i>, available all over campus, describes the offerings in detail.

  One class you may want to check out is <strong>Astronomy Workshop: Stars, Moons, Myths and Lore</strong>, with NASA/Ames researcher Joe Jordan. The class offers an evening of stargazing where you can learn everything you want to know about astronomy and space. Constellation mythology and lore from many cultures and ages will also be featured. The wonders of the night sky, the basics of observational astronomy, "cosmic ecology," and information on resources and equipment are covered first at an indoor lecture-discussion, which will be followed by a hike to the upper campus to view constellations, planets, galaxies, and nebulae (weather permitting). The cost is $15.
