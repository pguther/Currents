  Area youth shared in UCSC's celebration of Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday at the King Basketball Classic January 15, one of several campus events celebrating black history during winter quarter.
</p>
<p>
  Middle School teams from throughout the area competed at the West Gym, with athletic director Linda Spradley doing the play-by-play.
</p>
<p>
  The event blended basketball with African American history. Youngsters won prizes at halftime for their statements about King.
</p>
<p>
  "Goodie bags" including UCSC-related gifts and admissions information were also given to participants.
</p>
<p>
  "It exceeded my expectations," said Sis. Paula Livers-Powell, director of the African American Resource &amp; Cultural Center. The center's University Brothers/University Sisters played an active role in the tournament, cosponsored by the center and OPERS.
