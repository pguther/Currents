<p>
  Judit Moschkovich, associate professor of education, submitted a statement to the National Mathematics Advisory Panel during the group's Nov. 5-6 meeting in Palo Alto.
</p>
<p>
  Moschkovich submitted the statement on behalf of TODOS: Mathematics for All, an organization that advocates for an equitable and high-quality mathematics education for all students, in particular Hispanic and Latino students and students from minority populations, such as Native Americans and African Americans.
</p>
<p>
  The advisory panel was established by executive order of President Bush in April to improve student performance in mathematics. Panelists meeting at Stanford University heard testimony about student readiness for college-level mathematics, as well as updates on trends in international math and science study, the use of instructional technology, and other topics. Those who were unable to attend were invited to submit written comments addressing four areas: conceptual knowledge and skills; learning processes; instructional practices; and teachers.
</p>
<p>
  Moschkovich addressed the needs of Latino English learners in mathematics classrooms, discussing mathematical proficiency, conceptual understanding in mathematics, and why communication is important for learning mathematics.
