  Dana Priest, the award-winning <i>Washington Post</i> reporter who broke the story about the CIA's secret overseas prisons, will give a free public lecture March 6 at UCSC. Her talk, titled "The CIA's Secret War," will begin at 7:30 p.m. in the Colleges Nine and Ten Multipurpose Room.
</p>
<p>
  Priest, who earned a bachelor's degree in politics from UCSC in 1981, will be in town to accept the campus's first Distinguished Social Sciences Alumni Award. She covers national security for the <i>Post</i> and is the author of the 2003 book <i>The Mission: Waging War and Keeping Peace with America's Military</i>, which documents the U.S. government's growing reliance on military solutions to diplomatic problems. She is also an analyst for NBC News.
</p>

  "Dana Priest's crusading work brings enduring honor to UC Santa Cruz, and we are proud to claim her as a Social Sciences alumna," said Michael Hutchison, interim dean of the Division of Social Sciences and a professor of economics at UCSC. Priest was the unanimous choice of the committee of four UCSC faculty members and four alumni who reviewed nominations submitted by faculty, staff, and alumni.
</p>
<p>
  Priest's November story about the CIA's clandestine interrogation sites generated worldwide debate about the legality and morality of such facilities. In her story, she reported that the CIA has operated a secret network of detention and interrogation sites in up to eight countries, including a Soviet-era compound in Eastern Europe. More than 100 suspected terrorists, including 30 al Qaeda leaders, have been held in the covert prisons, which only a handful of officials in the United States and each host country knew about, she wrote.
