<p>
  Wireless computing has taken the campus by storm. So much so that big changes are hoped for next year.
</p>
<p>
  This Saturday morning technicians from Information Technology Services will shut the system down for two hours to complete some minor upgrades to improve service reliability. More extensive upgrades are in the planning stages with a target of midsummer or fall for completion, although funding remains an issue.
</p>
<p>
  CruzNet, the wireless Internet access system at UCSC, has been up for a bit more than two years. It went live campuswide in September 2003 with 160 access points. More were added in early 2004. CruzNet allows computer users across campus to connect wirelessly with the Internet and has proven extremely popular.
</p>
<p>
  Demand has been increasing, with students, staff, and faculty wanting more wireless access points in more areas, said Frank Koch III, ITS network tech supervisor, project manager for the original rollout.
</p>
<p>
  Usage has "grown tremendously," Koch said.
</p>
<p>
  The initial installation was funded with a one-time grant of $500,000, said Richard Chew, network services manager. Chew said ITS will be seeking funding to expand and upgrade.
</p>
<p>
  In 2003, about 100 users might have been logged on at one time, Koch said. That number has ballooned to 1,058 users at any one time today, he said.
</p>
<p>
  "We built a lot of growth potential into it, anticipated a lot of usage," Koch said.
</p>
<p>
  Now, the growth in usage and demand for more access is driving efforts to upgrade the system. Also, as technology advances, new equipment will allow for faster service and more security. Increasing system security is a goal, Chew said.
</p>
<p>
  Koch said there are now 223 access points on campus --essentially radio transmitters that send and receive radio waves from personal computers outfitted with the proper gear. Today's laptops typically have wireless capability built in. Wireless "cards" can be added to older models. (See <a href="http://its.ucsc.edu/services/network/cruznet/index.php">map of the coverage area</a>.)
</p>
<p>
  Occasionally, in the core area of campus, the system can reach maximum capacity, Koch said. ITS plans to double from 256 to 512 the number of IP addresses, or "openings," for the libraries, Science Hill, and College Nine and College Ten.
</p>
<p>
  On Saturday morning, technicians will make some changes to "rebalance the campus," said Robert Cartelli, network programmer analyst. Cartelli said technicians would shift some of the load from one server that gets a lot of usage to a third. They'll also make some minor upgrades in the technical underpinnings of the system.
</p>
<p>
  But the bigger changes are still to come, Koch said. There are plans to provide full encryption, allowing computer users to fully use all their applications including e-mail programs and messaging systems. In the early days, way back in 2003, efforts to provide full access to all Internet applications caused problems for the system and were subsequently shut down. Security is an issue because in wireless computing, data--sometimes sensitive--passes through the air where it can be intercepted.
</p>
<p>
  Also, as new access points are added they use more advanced technology allowing faster connections and wider transmission ranges. Eight new connection points are being added to Kerr Hall as part of renovations there, and more are being added to the Delaware Street facility.
</p>
<p>
  "Usage has been going up each and every year since we started," Chew said. "We're hoping by next fall to increase it even more."

<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  For the staff of UCSC's Gift Administration Office, holiday giving has an extra meaning: the annual rush of donors hurrying to capture tax deductions by making year-end donations to the campus.
</p>
<p>
  "Beginning in December and continuing into early January, we process between 600 and 1,000 donations to UCSC each week," said Kathryn Buckholdt, manager of Gift Administration, which is located off campus at 509A Swift Street. "Next to fiscal closing, it's our busiest time of the year."
</p>
<p>
  They are expecting a higher volume than usual this year, as donors take advantage of the <a href="http://giving.ucsc.edu/">Katrina Emergency Tax Relief Act</a>, which provides two federal tax breaks on gifts to tax-exempt organizations, including UCSC.
</p>
<p>
  To keep up with the rush, at least two members of the five-person Gift Administration staff work on each of the two vacation days of campus closure. "It's what we choose to do," said Buckholdt. "We get so busy it's hard to walk away and leave the work."
</p>
<p>
  One staff member even works on New Year's Eve, processing last-minute credit card donations arriving via UCSC's <a href="http://giveto.ucsc.edu">online giving site</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The campus benefits from their dedication. One year-end donor, Karoline Delaney (Crown '87), was reflecting on her annual giving when she decided to create a library subject endowment. "Because my degree is in chemistry," said Delaney, a patent attorney, "I have a special interest in wanting to benefit the scientific collections." She e-mailed a library staff member on December 29th, and by the next day the new Karoline A. Delaney Chemistry Endowment, honoring UCSC's Chemistry Department and professors, was established. Gift Administration's prompt processing helped make this possible.
</p>
<p>
  Although this story had a happy ending, donors are encouraged to send gifts as early as possible. This helps avoid unanticipated delays, such as postal-delivery problems or bank-cutoff dates for processing. UCSC faculty and staff members campuswide are also urged to forward any gift checks they may receive from donors to the Gift Administration Office--campus mail stop "UR Swift--as soon as possible.
</p>
<p>
  Large or small, each donation receives the same attention from Gift Administration, and each donation makes a difference for the campus.
</p>
<p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  The University of California has a new newsletter for UC faculty, staff, and students who are balancing academic goals or careers with family life. Called <a href="http://parents.berkeley.edu/ucfamilies/">UC Families</a>, the newsletter is web-based and parent-run and comes out about twice a month. In addition, the UC Families home page provides resources for families on UC campuses, UC-wide policy and benefits information, and archives of past advice and discussions.
</p>

<p>
  A senior writing lecturer, an epidemiologist in the international fight against AIDS, and a staff member who helps nontraditional students thrive have been selected to receive the UCSC Alumni Association's highest honors for the 2005-06 year.matter.
</p>
<p>
  Don Rothman will receive the Distinguished Teaching Award; Cheryl Scott, the Alumni Achievement Award; and Corinne Miller, the Outstanding Staff Award. The three will be honored along with 31 student award winnerss at the Alumni Association Awards Luncheon February 4.
</p>
<p>
  Students reflecting on courses with teaching award winner Don Rothman describe him as "amazing," "exceptional," and "bursting with enthusiasm." When asked how the course could be improved, many offered such comments as "It's perfect," "don't change a thing," or "don't retire." In nominating Rothman for the award, former student Ajia Mujic (Porter College, 2004) described his exemplary commitment to students. "Frequently, I found myself with Don in discussion both inside and out of class poring over ideas that our reflective writing had brought to mind...he has displayed to me the highest level of commitment to the quality of education offered by UCSC."
</p>
<p>
  Rothman's 32-year teaching career has been closely connected with UCSC's Oakes College. He began at the college in its early years, and helped define its academic vision and meet the needs of its diverse population. He also served as Oakes provost for a time in the 1990s. (<a href="http://currents.ucsc.edu/05-06/08-22/writing.asp">See Currents Online article</a>)
</p>
<p>
  Rothman was instrumental in creating and shaping the UCSC Writing Program, and has been generous in sharing his expertise. In 1977 he founded the Central California Writing Project, dedicated to helping elementary and secondary teachers and university faculty improve the teaching of writing across all disciplines. He has published many articles on the promise of writing to enhance democracy, and was honored in 2002 with a Distringuished Teaching Award from the UCSC Center for Teaching Excellence.
</p>
<p>
  As director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) operations in Tanzania from 2001 to 2005, alumni award winner Cheryl Scott was in the thick of the global battle against AIDS. Nearly 1.5 million Tanzanians, or an estimated 10 percent of the population, were living with HIV/AIDS at the end of 2003<strong>.</strong> Under Scott's leadership, CDC-Tanzania assisted the Tanzanian government to improve their national HIV/AIDS surveillance system, strengthen laboratory services, advance blood-transfusion safety and develop a network of antenatal health centers that target prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission.
</p>
<p>
  Scott's work in Tanzania was part of a wide-ranging public health and clinical career that has taken her around the world, with experiences in the Ivory Coast, Kenya, India and the Caribbean. Scott began her CDC career in 1993 as an investigator in the elite Epidemic Intelligence Service and also has worked in maternal and child health and disaster epidemiology in California, New York, and New Jersey, where she was the state maternal and child health epidemiologist. She has recently returned to the United States and is working as a medical director at CDC headquarters in Atlanta.
</p>
<p>
  A 1974 Oakes graduate in biology, Scott earned her medical degree from Boston University School of Medicine in 1982 and a master's degree in public health from Johns Hopkins in 1986. She completed a preventive medicine residency at CDC headquarters in 1995. She is published in the areas of reproductive and child health, disaster epidemiology, and HIV surveillance and laboratory strengthening. Scott is a captain in the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps and has received several Public Heath Service awards. (<a href="http://review.ucsc.edu/spring05/40Years/scott.asp">See UCSC Review story</a>)
</p>
<p>
  What began as a small support system for "nontraditional" women students--those not fitting the 18- to 22-year-old profile--has blossomed under staff award winner Corinne Miller's leadership. Services for Transfer and Re-entry Students (STARS) now welcomes more than 3,000 transfer and nontraditional students and has a solid record for student success. "As a testament to the quality of these programs, a greater proporiton of transfer and re-entry students are elected to Phi Beta Kappa than from the general population," wrote Ronaldo Ramirez, director of development in Student Affairs, in nominating Miller for the staff award. Last year, STARS took another progam under its wing, becoming the administrative base for the Rennaissance Scholars Program and the Page and Eloise Smith Scholastic Society, serving foster and homeless youth.
</p>
<p>
  Miller's leadership and advocacy inspired the UCSC Women's Club, the Soroptimists International, and the American Association of University Women to fund endowed scholarships for STARS students. Another group STARS works closely with, the UCSC Lifelong Learners organization, has developed a UCSC scholarship endowment.
</p>
<p>
  Miller's skill at finding housing, tutors, and jobs for students is matched by an amazing talent for motivation. "After you spend time with her, you really feel like there is nothing you can't do," said Yvonne W. Rodriguez, a 2001 physics graduate now working on her PhD in physics at UCSC. "Thank goodness she has an open-door policy so that you can stop in anytime you need support."
</p>
<p>
  In her more than 20 years of helping students, Miller's commitment has gone beyond any job description. "Corinne Miller and her staff created a small haven for those of us who did not fit into the normal college scene," wrote former re-entry student Patricia E. Boyer, who went on to get a master's degree from Harvard after graduating from UCSC.
</p>
<p>
  The Alumni Awards Luncheon will be held at noon on Saturday, February 4, at the College Nine/College Ten Multipurpose Room. In addition Rothman, Scott, and Miller, the luncheon will honor student winners of awards funded by the UCSC Alumni Association. RSVPs are required by January 27, and may be made by calling (831) 459-2530, (800) 933-SLUG, or<a href="http://alumni.ucsc.edu/">checking the alumni website.</a> The cost of the luncheon is $18.

In nominating Rothman for the award, former student Alija Mujic (Porter College, 2004) described his exemplary commitment to students. "Frequently, I found myself with Don in discussion both inside and out of class poring over ideas that our reflective writing had brought to mind...he has displayed to me the highest level of commitment to the quality of education offered by UCSC."
</p>
<p>
  Rothman's 32-year teaching career has been closely connected with UCSC's Oakes College. He began at the college in its early years, and helped define its academic vision and meet the needs of its diverse population. He also served as Oakes provost for a time in the 1990s. (<a href="http://currents.ucsc.edu/05-06/08-22/writing.asp">See Currents Online article</a>)
</p>
<p>
  Rothman was instrumental in creating and shaping the UCSC Writing Program, and has been generous in sharing his expertise. In 1977 he founded the Central California Writing Project, dedicated to helping elementary and secondary teachers and university faculty improve the teaching of writing across all disciplines. He has published many articles on the promise of writing to enhance democracy, and was honored in 2002 with a Distinguished Teaching Award from the UCSC Center for Teaching Excellence.

  As director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) operations in Tanzania from 2001 to 2005, alumni award-winner Cheryl Scott was in the thick of the global battle against AIDS. Nearly 1.5 million Tanzanians, or an estimated 10 percent of the population, were living with HIV/AIDS at the end of 2003<strong>.</strong> Under Scott's leadership, CDC-Tanzania assisted the Tanzanian government to improve its national HIV/AIDS surveillance system, strengthen laboratory services, advance blood-transfusion safety, and develop a network of antenatal health centers that target prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission.
</p>
<p>
  Scott's work in Tanzania was part of a wide-ranging public health and clinical career that has taken her around the world, with experiences in the Ivory Coast, Kenya, India, and the Caribbean. Scott began her CDC career in 1993 as an investigator in the elite Epidemic Intelligence Service and also has worked in maternal and child health and disaster epidemiology in California, New York, and New Jersey, where she was the state maternal and child health epidemiologist. She has recently returned to the United States and is working as a medical director at CDC headquarters in Atlanta.
</p>
<p>
  A 1974 Oakes graduate in biology, Scott earned her medical degree from Boston University School of Medicine in 1982 and a master's degree in public health from Johns Hopkins in 1986. She completed a preventive medicine residency at CDC headquarters in 1995. She is published in the areas of reproductive and child health, disaster epidemiology, and HIV surveillance and laboratory strengthening. Scott is a captain in the U.S. Public Health Service Commissioned Corps and has received several Public Heath Service awards. (<a href="http://review.ucsc.edu/spring05/40Years/scott.asp">See UCSC Review story</a>)
</p>
<p>
  What began as a small support system for "nontraditional" women students--those not fitting the 18- to 22-year-old profile--has blossomed under staff award-winner Corinne Miller's leadership. Services for Transfer and Re-entry Students (STARS) now welcomes more than 3,000 transfer and nontraditional students and has a solid record for student success. "As a testament to the quality of these programs, a greater proportion of transfer and re-entry students are elected to Phi Beta Kappa than from the general population," wrote Ronaldo Ramirez, director of development in Student Affairs, in nominating Miller for the staff award. Last year, STARS took another progam under its wing, becoming the administrative base for the Renaissance Scholars Program and the Page and Eloise Smith Scholastic Society, serving foster and homeless youth.
</p>
<p>
  Miller's leadership and advocacy inspired the UCSC Women's Club, the Soroptimist International, and the American Association of University Women to fund endowed scholarships for STARS students. Another group STARS works closely with, the UCSC Lifelong Learners organization, has developed a UCSC scholarship endowment.
</p>
<p>
  Miller's skill at finding housing, tutors, and jobs for students is matched by an amazing talent for motivation. "After you spend time with her, you really feel like there is nothing you can't do," said Yvonne W. Rodriguez, a 2001 physics graduate now working on her Ph.D. in physics at UCSC. "Thank goodness she has an open-door policy so that you can stop in anytime you need support."
</p>
<p>
  In her more than 20 years of helping students, Miller's commitment has gone beyond any job description. "Corinne Miller and her staff created a small haven for those of us who did not fit into the normal college scene," wrote former re-entry student Patricia E. Boyer, who went on to get a master's degree from Harvard after graduating from UCSC.
</p>
<p>
  The Alumni Awards Luncheon will be held at noon on Saturday, February 4, at the College Nine/College Ten Multipurpose Room. In addition to Rothman, Scott, and Miller, the luncheon will honor student winners of awards funded by the UCSC Alumni Association. RSVPs are required by January 27, and may be made by calling (831) 459-2530, (800) 933-SLUG, or <a href="http://alumni.ucsc.edu/">checking the alumni web site.</a> The cost of the luncheon is $18.

        <title>Staff renew push for fee discounts for employees' children, spouses, partners</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 05 Dec 2005 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>

        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  UC staff leaders are reviving the long-discussed proposal to offer educational fee discounts to employees' spouses, domestic partners and children, and they say it could be on the Board of Regents' agenda as early as January.
</p>
<p>
  "The timing is right to bring it back," said Rosemary Anderson, chair of the Council of University of California Staff Assemblies, or CUCSA. Anderson is executive assistant to associate vice chancellor of Colleges and University Housing Services Jean Marie Scott at UCSC.
</p>
<p>
  Anderson said CUCSA is working with allies on the Board of Regents to put the fee discount proposal back on the table. Also, UCSF work-life professional David Bell, who served as CUCSA chair in 2004 and is now one of two staff advisers to Regents' committees, said he is "strategizing" with the UC Office of the President on the proposal.
</p>
<p>
  Anderson, Bell and other staff and faculty leaders continue to maintain that the discounts would aid in employee recruitment and retention.
</p>
<p>
  And, Anderson said, "This would go a long way in boosting morale. What a great gesture for our dependents to attend the university that we all serve."
</p>
<p>
  She said staff is "ideally looking at a full waiver," though partial discounts also have been discussed. A faculty proposal in 2004 called for phased-in discounts: 50 percent for three years and 100 percent after that.
</p>
<p>
  A full waiver for four years of undergraduate study, two semesters or three quarters a year, would be worth about $21,600, based on 2005-06 fees. Regular-status UC employees already get a two-thirds discount on registration and educational fees for regular-session courses of up to nine units or three courses per quarter or semester, whichever provides the greater benefit.
</p>
<p>
  The Academic Council put forth recommendations in 2000, 2002 and 2004 for fee discounts for dependents. "And our position really hasn't changed," UCLA professor Cliff Brunk, council chair, said this week.
</p>
<p>
  UC President Robert Dynes rejected the Academic Council's 2004 proposal to extend fee discounts to dependents, citing "four years of state budget cuts" and higher priorities such as faculty salaries and maintaining educational program quality.
</p>
<p>
  Anderson commented that the Board of Regents put off the proposal "because of the perceived associated cost."
</p>
<p>
  Indeed, in a 2002 letter to the Academic Council, then-President Richard Atkinson estimated an annual cost of $5.6 million to waive all educational fees for employees' dependents.
</p>
<p>
  Anderson said, "That's really a relatively small amount of money in terms of gain," while Brunk noted, "It does have a real expense associated with it. It's just a question of where you want to put your money now."
</p>
<p>
  Brad Hayward, executive director of strategic communications for the UC Office of the President, said: "There is a long list of competing priorities for funding as our budget situation slowly begins to recover, and this proposal would need to be factored into that conversation."
</p>
<p>
  Hayward said the UC will "certainly take a close look at what CUCSA proposes. We know there historically has been wide employee interest in such a benefit, though it is also a benefit that likely would be used by relatively few employees at any one time."
</p>
<p>
  In calculating its $5.6 million cost estimate in 2002, the UC administration looked at October 2000 enrollment and employment data and identified 2,044 students as dependents of 1,905 employees. That number of employees accounted for about 1.3 percent of the work force of 150,640 full- and part-time workers in April 2000.
</p>
<p>
  At the time, Atkinson acknowledged that more dependents might enroll if fee discounts were available, "but there is no accurate way to predict the impact (that) approval of the benefit would have on these figures."
</p>
<p>
  The Academic Council's 2004 resolution sought 100 percent fee waivers for qualified dependents of all faculty and other eligible employees, described as having membership in the UC Retirement Program and five years of service.
</p>
<p>
  Anderson said that in the San Francisco Bay Area alone, she knows of staff members who left for Stanford, Santa Clara and St. Mary's to get free tuition for dependents.
</p>
<p>
  Those universities are private. Fee discounts for employee dependents are not as prevalent among public institutions. In the California State University system, however, employees can take two courses or six units per term without paying educational fees, and any employee can transfer this benefit to a spouse or child.
</p>
<p>
  The University of Maryland is among the public institutions that offer tuition discounts to employee dependents. Those with in-state residency pay zero tuition, a savings of $6,566 for 2005-06. However, they are required to pay $1,255 in mandatory fees.
</p>
<p>
  Dave Rieger, assistant director for benefits at UM at College Park, said the administration "grumbles" now and then about doing away with the fee waivers, "but it kind of gets pooh-poohed."
</p>
<p>
  Maryland's tuition remission program dates back at least three decades. He said changes to the policy since 1990 include: Participants cannot previously have obtained an undergraduate degree; they cannot get a waiver on graduate studies; and the fee waiver is available only after the employee has been on staff for two years.
</p>
<p>
  "If this were to go away," Rieger said, "we'd have a hard time getting decent people that we'd want to stay."

<p>
  Rock samples collected last year show surprising variation in the chemistry of an undersea volcano on the Juan de Fuca Ridge near Seattle.
</p>
<p>
  The variation comes from the mantle, the source of the magma that erupted from the volcano to form the rocks, and may influence the microbial communities that now inhabit the volcano, said James Gill, professor of Earth sciences at UCSC.
</p>
<p>
  "By terrestrial standards this is a piddly little volcano, but we're finding more chemical variation per unit area than has been found before in a seafloor volcano," Gill said.
</p>
<p>
  A remote-controlled submersible called <i>Tiburon</i> collected the rock samples that Gill and others are using to study the volcano. The submersible, owned by the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI), is connected to the research ship <i>Western Flyer</i> by a fiber-optic cable and controlled by a joystick while it dives to depths of more than 2,000 meters. The ability to collect fragile samples, to know their location within meters, and to see their geological context was essential to the mission, Gill said.
</p>
<p>
  "The submersible allows us to pinpoint the location of samples and document surrounding rock formations in a way that's impossible with manned submersibles," he said.
</p>
<p>
  In addition to rock samples, <i>Tiburon</i> also collected hours of high-definition video footage from the ridge site, allowing scientists to view the undersea environment in exquisite detail while sitting safely on the surface. The video footage shows bulging lava formations called pillow basalt and towering mineral chimneys that grow around undersea hydrothermal vents. The vents provide heat and minerals that support an entire food chain of strange undersea creatures.
</p>
<p>
  The global mid-ocean ridge system is the largest single volcanic feature on Earth and is responsible for the continual renewal of the Earth's crust. Scientists know that the mantle rises and melts in ridge areas, forming magma that ultimately forms new oceanic crust. But exactly where the magma comes from and how it forms the crust remain unclear.
</p>
<p>
  Gill and his co-workers, including UCSC graduate students Jenni Kela and Jason Woodcock, hope that the rock samples collected by <i>Tiburon</i> will help them answer these questions. Preliminary analysis of the more than 250 rock samples collected by <i>Tiburon</i> shows some surprising results.
</p>
<p>
  "The volcano looks symmetrical, but we're finding that the basalt rock on the east flank of the volcano cannot have formed from the same magma as the rock on the west flank," Gill said.

  The two sides of the volcano probably formed at different times when the underlying magma had different characteristics, he said. Further analysis will help researchers determine when the rocks formed to draw a clearer picture of how the volcano has acted in the past.
</p>
<p>
  "We hope to use the chemistry of the rocks and the chronology of when they formed to develop a geologic model of volcano activity," Gill said. "This may help us understand why the mantle delivers so much chemical diversity here, but not in other volcanoes."
</p>
<p>
  The researchers speculate that the volcano's chemical diversity contributes to the differences in their active hydrothermal vents, and that these differences extend to the biological systems the vents support. This research was conducted as part of a project sponsored by the National Science Foundation that focuses on the geology and biology of oceanic ridge spreading systems. The project, called Ridge 2000, includes scientists from a wide range of disciplines who study everything "from mantle to microbes" to understand how the interior of the Earth ultimately affects life in this novel environment, Gill said.

        <title>Simulations shed light on Earth's history of magnetic field reversals</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_7774" align="alignright" width="100"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/12/coe.05-12-05.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7774" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/12/coe.05-12-05.jpg" alt="Robert Coe" width="100" height="121" /></a>Robert Coe[/caption]

<p>
  A new analysis of computer simulations of Earth's magnetic field suggests that its behavior was different early in Earth's history, resulting in greater stability and fewer reversals of the magnetic field.
</p>
<p>
  The findings by UCSC researchers are helping to reconcile the geologic record of magnetic field reversals with the current understanding of how the Earth's core generates the planet's magnetic field.
</p>
<p>
  Robert Coe and Gary Glatzmaier, both professors of Earth sciences, combine studies of the paleomagnetic records preserved in rocks with complex computer models of the "geodynamo" that generates the magnetic field. Working together, they are gaining new insights into the effects on the magnetic field of processes occurring deep within the Earth.
</p>
<p>
  The magnetic field arises as a result of interactions in the Earth's iron-rich core, which consists of a solid inner core and a fluid outer core. The flow of heat from the core drives fluid motions in the outer core that produce an electric current and generate the magnetic field.
</p>
<p>
  On human timescales, the magnetic field reliably aligns compass needles, helps animals navigate, and deflects some of the Sun's radiation. But on geologic timescales, it is far from stable--weakening, strengthening, and sometimes even reversing itself. A reversal of the magnetic field would cause the needles on compasses to point south instead of north.
</p>
<p>
  In the last 15 million years (a relatively brief interval in Earth's history), the magnetic field has reversed roughly four to five times every million years. But records from the ocean floor indicate that reversal rates have been much lower at various times in the past. In fact, during a period that began 120 million years ago, there are no records of any magnetic reversals for nearly 35 million years, Coe said.
</p>
<p>
  The geodynamo simulations show that the shape of the magnetic field may be an important factor controlling reversal rates. The symmetry and stability of the simulated field varies depending on the pattern of heat flow imposed at the core-mantle boundary. When the field is symmetrical in Northern and Southern Hemispheres, the simulations show frequent reversals. Conversely, when the field is strongly antisymmetric, with the Northern and Southern Hemispheres displaying opposite features, it reverses infrequently or not at all.
</p>
<p>
  This finding is consistent with studies by other researchers of the paleomagnetic record of Earth's magnetic field during the 35 million years with no reversals, indicating that it was much more antisymmetric then than it is today.
</p>
<p>
  The simulation that produced the most antisymmetric and most stable field is one with an inner core only one-quarter of its current size. Scientists believe that as the core cools, iron crystallizes out of the fluid outer core onto the solid inner core, causing the inner core to grow slowly over time. Thus, this simulation mimics conditions deep in Earth's past and predicts that reversals would have occurred much less frequently then than now. A survey of the sparse literature on the magnetic field 2 billion and more years ago suggests that this may well have been the case, Coe said.
</p>
<p>
  "The data are consistent with simulations showing that field symmetry influences reversal rate," he said.

        <title>Ancient sediments show influence of southern ocean circulation on climate</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 05 Dec 2005 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  About 34 million years ago, the Earth's climate transitioned from a "greenhouse climate" to the "icehouse climate" of today, forming a massive ice sheet on the Antarctic continent.
</p>
<p>
  A new study by Linda Anderson, an ocean sciences researcher at UCSC, suggests that oceanographic features in the Southern Ocean--the intensity of current flow and the amount of stratification (the formation of distinct layers at different depths)--may have played a key role in the transition.
</p>
<p>
  Anderson analyzed the chemical properties of seafloor sediments laid down millions of years ago to piece together a picture of how Southern Ocean circulation may have looked deep in the past. The periods covered in her study include the transition from the Eocene to the Oligocene epochs about 33 million years ago and a similar transition between the Oligocene and Miocene epochs about 23 million years ago. These transitions coincided with a configuration of Earth's orbit around the Sun that facilitated ice growth. Some additional factor on Earth, however, amplified the climate response during these transitions.
</p>
<p>
  The geological record suggests that this additional factor was a reduction of greenhouse warming due to a decrease in atmospheric carbon dioxide. The Southern Ocean may have played a role in the drawdown of atmospheric carbon dioxide through its influence on the global carbon cycle, Anderson said.
</p>
<p>
  Her study suggests that, unlike today, the mixing of the Southern Ocean around the time of the climate shift was neither as intense nor as deep as it is now. As a result, the ocean was more stratified and regional characteristics of deep and intermediate waters were maintained. This layered structure may have had important consequences for global carbon cycling, setting the stage for the transition from greenhouse to icehouse.
</p>
<p>
  Phytoplankton--tiny plants growing in the surface waters--use carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and transform it into organic carbon. When the plants (or animals that feed on them) die and decompose, most of the organic carbon is recycled, but a small amount is buried within the deep ocean. In a layered ocean, dead organisms can drift into the deeper layers before they decompose, effectively burying the organic carbon in the depths.
</p>
<p>
  Shifting continents have gradually changed the Southern Ocean over the past 30 million years so that water now whips around Antarctica in a strong current known as the Antarctic Circumpolar Current. The strength of the current blocks the influx of nutrient-poor surface water and, as this current squeezes through the narrow passage between South America and Antarctica, it mixes the water from top to bottom. As a result, most of the organic carbon formed within the Southern Ocean today is oxidized before it can be buried.
</p>
<p>
  The impact of organic carbon burial on the atmospheric carbon dioxide depends on the relative burial of organic carbon to total carbon. The types of organisms that fix organic carbon are important, because some form shells of inorganic carbon in a process that releases carbon dioxide. Regional characteristics of the water affect which organisms are favored ecologically by controlling the nutrient content of the surface ocean. The integral relationship between biology (the organisms that fix the organic carbon) and the physical structure of the ocean (both the delivery of nutrients and removal of organic carbon for burial) ultimately control the atmospheric carbon dioxide, Anderson said.
</p>
<p>
  As scientists search for ways to remove carbon from the atmosphere and reduce global warming, understanding organic carbon burial mechanisms of the past and the role of the structure of the ocean will give us important insights into how the global system may behave in the future, Anderson said.
</p>
<p>
  "We have a long way to go to understand the modern Earth system, but because we only have one Earth, we must turn to the geological record to provide us with test cases," she said.

        <title>Soil ecologist investigates role of plant roots in regulating carbon cycling, reducing global warming</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_7743" align="alignright" width="230"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/12/cheng.05-12-05.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7743" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/12/cheng.05-12-05.jpg" alt="Soil ecologist Weixin Cheng Photo: Jennifer McNulty" width="230" height="153" /></a>Soil ecologist Weixin Cheng Photo: Jennifer McNulty[/caption]
<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  Soil ecologist Weixin Cheng is at the leading edge of scientific efforts to quantify the impacts of plant roots on the cycling of carbon between the atmosphere, where carbon dioxide contributes to global warming, and terrestrial ecosystems, where large amounts of carbon are stored in soil organic matter.
</p>
<p>
  Cheng, an associate professor of environmental studies at UCSC, studies complex above- and below-ground systems to gather data on the movement of carbon in terrestrial ecosystems.
</p>
<p>
  Plant roots contribute as much as 50 percent of the total carbon dioxide produced by terrestrial ecosystems, and they also play a major role in adding organic carbon to soil. But many studies of soil carbon have measured it in incubated soil samples that lack roots and vegetation.
</p>
<p>
  "We've been oversimplifying the ecosystem," said Cheng, who has developed new techniques of measuring below-ground carbon cycles.
</p>
<p>
  In the greenhouse, Cheng is evaluating numerous plants, including soybeans, corn, wheat, Ponderosa pine, cottonwood, and amaranths.
</p>
<p>
  By focusing on the rhizosphere, the soil that surrounds the roots of a plant, Cheng has documented changes in the rate of soil organic matter decomposition that vary from 70 percent suppression to 300 percent stimulation, a range that underscores Cheng's assertion that soil processes cannot be understood under plantless conditions.
</p>
<p>
  Cheng isolates the impacts of different plant species by controlling atmospheric carbon dioxide and using soil samples with varied "signatures" based on carbon-13 isotope levels. The variation in soils allows Cheng to mix-and-match plant-soil combinations in the greenhouse and isolate preexisting soil carbon from carbon produced by plant roots. In addition, he uses a small, specialized videocamera to document below-ground root changes over time.
</p>
<p>
  "These methods generate a whole array of new questions," he said. "How do different plant species differ? Do different soils respond to different plants in different ways? It makes the research much more difficult."<br>
  <br>
  The answers, however, can be invaluable to land managers developing strategies to store more carbon in the soil to counteract global warming.

        <title>Parking lot expansion, car-sharing program discussed at forum</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  Expansion of the East Remote parking lot, introduction of a car-share program, and a continuing shift away from campus core parking could be in UCSC's future.
</p>
<p>
  That was the word from Transportation and Parking Services director Wes Scott at a November 30 forum on transportation and parking sponsored by the Staff Advisory Board. Scott answered questions submitted in advance by the Staff Advisory Board and fielded questions from the audience at Baskin 152 on a range of issues.
</p>
<p>
  Speculating on the next major change in parking facilities, Scott said the East Remote parking lot on Hagar Drive would be a good candidate for expansion, with a deck over the existing lot to provide another level of parking. It would also make sense, he said, to establish a transit hub--similar to that now at Quarry Plaza--nearby. "That's the vision of the future," Scott said.
</p>
<p>
  Expanding on the plan later, Scott noted that the East Remote lot was among locations discussed in the <a href="http://lrdp.ucsc.edu/draft2005lrdp/2005LRDP(LRDP,1-27-05draft).pdf">Draft Long Range Development Plan</a> as possible sites for increased parking.
</p>
<p>
  In the nearer term, Scott said TAPS is exploring a car-share program it expects to start this spring. Under the pilot program, users would pay a single fee covering everything from fuel to maintenance. The cars would probably be hybrids, and the program is expected to be limited to those 21 and older, because of insurance costs.
</p>
<p>
  As envisioned, the car-sharing program would allow users--students, faculty, and staff--to reserve a car online once they had paid a fee to join the system. Users would pay an additional charge depending on their usage of the program. The cars could be reserved for a very short time to run an errand or for a few days, and would not be limited to campus use, Scott explained after the forum.
</p>
<p>
  Many of the questions at the forum concerned difficulties with parking, but Scott did not have much encouraging news. The emphasis on "infill" construction--building on available sites within the campus core--means that parking will continue to be shifted to the campus periphery. "The ultimate vision for the campus core is to be primarily pedestrian," he said. "The days of parking close in are coming to an end."
</p>
<p>
  Parking and transit problems at the satellite offices at 2300 Delaware also prompted questions at the forum. While Metro buses make hourly runs between 2300 Delaware and campus, the service can be problematic for those needing to drop off paperwork on campus.
</p>
<p>
  Scott noted that TAPS gets its funding solely from parking fees and its share of parking fines ($3 per ticket). Employees at 2300 Delaware do not pay for parking, meaning there is no revenue source to fund shuttles. He predicted free parking at 2300 Delaware will end at some point, but offered no timetable. "You guys will have <i>plenty</i> of notice," he said. In the meantime, he reminded the audience that a single parking permit can be shared among employees at 2300 Delaware, and suggested it might be helpful to lease a vehicle from fleet services.
</p>
<p>
  On other topics, Scott said:
</p>
<p>
  * Additional parking facilities cannot be built until utilization studies show the current lots are being utilized at 90 percent of capacity. The latest surveys show UCSC lots average 75 percent of capacity.
</p>
<p>
  * Adding more shuttles to serve early-arriving and later-departing employees in the parking lots is not possible at this time because of the extra cost.
</p>
<p>
  * Bike shuttle service to the campus from Olive Street has been extended until 1 p.m. on weekdays. Also, the Metro district's plan to add racks that can carry more bicycles has been delayed by a patent dispute over the racks.
</p>
<p>
  <em>*</em> Comments and suggestions are welcome at <a href="mailto:taps@ucsc.edu">taps@ucsc.edu</a>, and members of the campus community are invited to attend meetings or learn more about the <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/taps/pages/tactoc.html">Transportation Advisory Committee</a>.

<p>
  In <i>Nightingale</i>--the first thesis project of UCSC's new graduate program in Digital Arts/New Media--dancers onstage trigger digital effects through their intricate movements, creating streams of light and colors that appear on images of their bodies projected on screens behind them.
</p>
<p>
  Featuring video illuminated on three screens, interactive digital media, theater improvisation, and original sonic compositions, <i>Nightingale</i> is the result of an ambitious collaboration between five Digital Arts/New Media graduate students and BarnStorm, the new student-run company of UCSC's Theater Arts Department.
</p>
<p>
  The production was choreographed by assistant theater arts professor Ted Warburton, who worked with student media designer Jess Damsen to pilot the use of a technology called ActiveSpace, developed by professor John Crawford at UC Irvine. With computer hardware newly purchased by the Digital Arts/New Media program, UCSC students can now take advantage of an interactive dance system that allows dancers to generate digital effects from their movements on stage.
</p>
<p>
  "The basic idea is that one camera captures the image of a dancer, another camera registers the movement of that dancer onstage, and that movement triggers effects depending on how they are programmed," explained Porter College lecturer and DANM grad student Bob Giges. "The effects are then projected on screens behind the dancer."
</p>
<p>
  Giges wrote the script for the production for his M.F.A. thesis project, taking the classic Hans Christian Andersen tale of <i>The Nightingale</i> and embedding it into a contemporary story about relationships in turmoil. He said he deliberately included additional forms of live interaction to draw the audience in.
</p>
<p>
  "We would interview audience members before the show and ask them probing questions about their relationships--such as 'what problem do you need to tell your partner about urgently?' said Giges. "We recorded all their answers on a digital recorder. And as the writer of the play, three times I called for playback of these testimonies, which led to improvisation by the romantic leads--who incorporated the problems of the audience into the relationships of their own characters on the stage."
</p>
<p>
  <i>Nightingale</i> was directed by Digital Arts/New Media grad student Timothy Jordan and featured a number of undergraduate and graduate students from a variety of disciplines in all of the acting roles and technical positions. Giges said the production took more than six months to launch, culminating in five performances in November at the Barn Theater.
</p>
<p>
  Giges, who has taught film and writing classes at Porter College for the past 25 years, will graduate with UCSC's first Digital Arts/New Media M.F.A. class in June. He said he plans to rewrite the <i>Nightingale</i> script and send it around to major venues to see if it can be produced professionally. Giges added that he is proud of UCSC's new graduate program, which he helped develop as an assistant to the Arts Division dean in 2001.
</p>
<p>
  "The M.F.A. is the highest degree for artists, and we have never had a professional training ground for artists at UCSC," Giges noted. "The M.F.A. is definitely a significant feather in the cap for the campus."

<p>
  Dozens of UCSC researchers are among the 11,000 scientists from all over the world gathering this week in San Francisco for the 2005 Fall Meeting of the American Geophysical Union (AGU).
</p>
<p>
  Presentations at this premier meeting of the Earth and space sciences cover a vast range of topics, including the latest research on climate change, earthquakes, volcanoes, planetary exploration, and Earth's magnetic field. Some of the findings that UCSC researchers will present at the meeting are described in the stories below--a small selection from an impressive UCSC contingent.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Simulations shed light on Earth's history of magnetic field reversals:</strong> Analysis of computer simulations of Earth's magnetic field suggests that its behavior was different early in Earth's history, resulting in greater stability and fewer reversals of the magnetic field. (<a href="http://currents.ucsc.edu/05-06/12-05/simulations.asp">Full story</a>)
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Unmanned submersible finds surprises in an undersea volcano:</strong> Rock samples collected last year show more variation in the chemistry of an undersea volcano on the Juan de Fuca Ridge near Seattle than has been documented in any other seafloor volcano. (<a href="http://currents.ucsc.edu/05-06/12-05/submersible.asp">Full story</a>)
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Ancient sediments show influence of Southern Ocean circulation on climate:</strong> Oceanographic features of the Southern Ocean may have played a key role in the transition from a "greenhouse climate" to an "icehouse climate" 34 million years ago through their influence on the global carbon cycle. (<a href="http://currents.ucsc.edu/05-06/12-05/sediments.asp">Full story</a>)
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Soil ecologist investigates the role of plant roots in regulating carbon cycling and reducing global warming:</strong> Plant roots influence the cycling of carbon between the atmosphere, where carbon dioxide contributes to global warming, and terrestrial ecosystems, where large amounts of carbon are stored in soil organic matter.

<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  John Dizikes, a professor emeritus of American studies, will give this year's Emeriti Faculty Lecture on December 8 in the UCSC Media Theater at 7 p.m. The presentation, which will include music, is free and open to the public.
</p>
<p>
  Dizikes's talk, titled "Nation and Homeland in Nineteenth Century Italian Opera," is about the response of Italian opera composers to the rise of nationalism in 19th-century Italy. The major theme of aspiring to create a unified homeland, found throughout Italian history and opera, will be his focus.
</p>
<p>
  Dizikes's teaching and research interests range from politics to history of the arts. He is the author of numerous books and articles, including <i>Opera in America: A Cultural History</i> (Yale University Press, 1993), which won the 1993 National Book Critics Circle Award for criticism, and <i>Yankee Doodle Dandy: The Life and Times of Tod Sloan</i> (University of Nebraska Press, 2004).
</p>
<p>
  Dizikes came to UCSC in 1965. A winner of the UCSC Alumni Association's Distinguished Teaching Award, Dizikes served as Cowell College provost, and mentored thousands of students during his career at UCSC. He continues to be an active member of the campus community.
</p>
<p>
  The Emeriti Faculty Lecture is sponsored by the Office of the Chancellor. For questions or accommodation requirements, contact Kristin Palma at (831) 459-5075 or <a href="mailto:kpalma@ucsc.edu">kpalma@ucsc.edu</a>.

        <title>Anna Tsing awarded book prize from the American Ethnological Association</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_7728" align="alignright" width="200"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/12/tsing_bookcover.200.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7728" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/12/tsing_bookcover.200.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="303" /></a>[/caption]

<p>
  Anna Tsing, professor of anthropology, has received the 2005 Senior Book Prize from the American Ethnological Association (AEA) for her book, <i>Friction: An Ethnography of Global Connection</i> (Princeton University Press, 2004). Tsing shares the prize with Michael Fischer, professor of anthropology and science and technology studies at MIT, who was honored for his book <i>Emergent Forms of Life and the Anthropological Voice</i>. The recipients were announced at the association's business meeting on December 1.
</p>
<p>
  In <i>Friction</i>, Tsing challenges the widespread view that globalization invariably signifies a "clash" of cultures, and she develops the concept of friction in its place as a metaphor for the diverse and conflicting social interactions that make up our contemporary world. She focuses on the Indonesian rainforest, where local and national environmentalists, international science, North American investors, advocates for Brazilian rubber tappers, UN funding agencies, mountaineers, village elders, and urban students, among others, all combine in unpredictable, messy misunderstandings, but misunderstandings that sometimes work out.
</p>
<p>
  The Senior Book Prize is presented every other year by the AEA to recognize books by senior scholars that "speak to contemporary social issues with relevance beyond the discipline and beyond the academy." For the 2005 awards, the selection committee considered books published in 2003 and 2004. The committee was cochaired by the recipients of the previous award, Kim Fortun, associate professor of science and technology studies at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, and Adriana Petryna, assistant professor of anthropology at the New School for Social Research.<br>

        <title>UCSC team reaches the finals in Nanochallenge 2005</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 05 Dec 2005 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>

<p>
  A team of UCSC researchers was among 20 finalists who traveled to Italy in November to present their ideas to a panel of expert judges in a nanotechnology business plan competition. The UCSC team ultimately placed fifth out of 70 entrants in the Nanochallenge 2005 competition, organized by Veneto Nanotech.
</p>
<p>
  David Deamer, professor and chair of biomolecular engineering, participated in the competition together with graduate student Roger Chen, who was responsible for the financial aspects of their business plan. The group also included Holger Schmidt, assistant professor of electrical engineering, Mark Akeson, adjunct professor biomolecular engineering, and Aaron Hawkins of Brigham Young University.
</p>
<p>
  Their project involved the use of nanotechnology in a device for rapidly identifying single molecular structures. Called "Aropor," the fluorescence-activated molecular identifier could be used, for example, to detect virus-infected individuals passing through airports if a pandemic occurs, Deamer said.
</p>
<p>
  The contest was a valuable opportunity to present nanotechnology ideas in terms of business proposals and get feedback from potential investors, Deamer said.

<p>
  Meeting November 16-17, the University of California Board of Regents approved an increase in student fees, and also took action on compensation issues.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>* Undergraduate fees increased 8 percent.</strong> The 2006-07 budget proposal includes funding for student enrollment growth, expanded support for graduate education, improvements in the student-faculty ratio, additional aid for low- and middle-income families, and permanent state support for academic preparation programs. The Regents approved fee increases of 8 percent ($492) for resident undergraduates, 10 percent ($690) for resident graduate academic students, and 5 percent (dollar amounts varying by school) for most professional school students in 2006-07. (<a href="http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/2005/nov16a.html">Read full story</a>)
</p>
<p>
  <strong>* Merit increases for senior officers approved.</strong> The Regents approved regular annual merit increases averaging 2.5 percent for senior UC management, including President Robert C. Dynes, chancellors and other UC officers. On Oct. 1, UC staff employees not covered by union contracts received general salary increases based on a 3.5 percent funding pool (increases for union-represented employees are governed by collective bargaining agreements). (<a href="http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/2005/nov17.html">See full story</a>)
</p>
<p>
  <strong>* Compensation proposal approved</strong>. The UC Board of Regents approved RE-61, a proposal aimed at ensuring competitive compensation and benefits for all UC faculty and staff. Under the proposal, UC will establish specific goals in order to achieve market-competitive salaries for all employees over the next 10 years. A third part of RE-61 regarding the use of private funds to augment the salaries of certain senior positions was not discussed.

        <title>Campus provost outlines his office's priorities</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  In his opening remarks at the fall-quarter meeting of UCSC's Academic Senate, Campus Provost David Kliger described six operational areas of the campus that he considers priorities for the current year.
</p>
<p>
  The six are:<br>
  <br>
  * <strong>Increase the rate of faculty hiring.</strong> While the campus already has projections for the ultimate size of each Academic Division, Kliger said he will make short-term investments that will "increase the rate" of faculty hiring in the near future.<br>
  <br>
  * <strong>Provide additional support to units and/or activities that generate money for the campus.</strong> UCSC, he said, should "invest in those areas of campus that will generate more revenue," he said, citing University Relations, the Office of Research, and Graduate Studies as examples of such areas.<br>
  <br>
  * <strong>Replenish UCSC's leadership team.</strong> Kliger noted that the campus is engaged in three searches for deans and a number of other senior-level posts. "These are all going to be critical positions for us," he said.<br>
  <br>
  * <strong>Make additional progress consolidating UCSC's information technology and business processes.</strong> Kliger described himself as "surprised and pleased" by how smoothly the consolidations have gone to date, but said a tremendous amount of work remains to be done to ensure optimal service to campus units.<br>
  <br>
  * <strong>Improve employee compensation.</strong> Kliger said the state budget and UC Office of the President are significant drivers of this, but added that "the chancellor and I have it as a high priority to push this issue at a systemwide level."<br>
  <br>
  * <strong>Look for additional solutions to UCSC's faculty housing difficulties.</strong> In addition to getting construction started on Ranch View Terrace, Kliger said he will seek to "maximize affordability" by exploring possibilities on a number of fronts--including support for new Office of the President loan programs and funding, an augmentation of campus financing, and a modification of resale policies for existing units.<br>
  <br>
  "We have a lot of challenges ahead of us," Kliger concluded. "But challenges are what keep life interesting."

<p>
  Displaying characteristic good humor, Secretary of State Bruce McPherson laid it on the line for a student-dominated crowd that attended his talk November 17 about the importance of voting in the democratic process.
</p>
<p>
  "Only one of four of you cared enough to participate in the most basic right and duty we have in our democracy," McPherson said, referring to the low participation of potential voters aged 18 to 24. "What's up with that? That's a pathetic statistic."
</p>
<p>
  McPherson addressed about 300 people who turned out for the Social Sciences Division's Distinguished Guest Lecture, discussing the recent special election, the initiative process, and doing his best to inspire young people to vote.
</p>
<p>
  A former legislator from Santa Cruz, McPherson served in the state Assembly and the state Senate. He became the 30th secretary of state of California on March 30, 2005. He was a reporter and editor at the <i>Santa Cruz Sentinel</i> for 26 years before entering politics.
</p>
<p>
  "I'm a Republican from Santa Cruz--just get over it," McPherson ribbed the audience. "I was known as the oxymoron of the Legislature."
</p>
<p>
  Voting is the basis of democracy, said McPherson, who reminded the audience that voting rights were originally restricted to white men who owned property. Access to the ballot box expanded with the 15th Amendment in 1870, which prohibited restrictions based on race, and the 19th Amendment, which gave women the right to vote in 1920. The Voting Rights Act in 1965 offered assistance to non-English-speaking voters, 18-year-olds won the right to vote in 1971, and those with special needs were guaranteed equal opportunities to vote in 1990.
</p>
<p>
  "The right to vote hasn't come easily, and it certainly wasn't equal from the get-go," he said. "We should acknowledge that by voting on every Election Day."
</p>
<p>
  McPherson, who as secretary of state administers state elections, got a "little more close and personal" with the crowd, asking, "What is it about you 18- to 24-year-olds that you don't like voting?" Of California's 22 million eligible voters, about 16 million are registered. Last November, 76 percent of registered voters in the state cast a ballot--the highest turnout in a presidential election in 24 years. But younger voters are failing to participate, he said, adding that his office has resurrected the practice of sending birthday cards to Californians on their 18th birthday, encouraging them to register to vote.
</p>
<p>
  Voting is an extension of community involvement, and greater participation could yield bigger margins and create a greater mandate for successful candidates and propositions, he said, recounting several recent races that were decided by a single vote.
</p>
<p>
  "Don't tell me every vote doesn't count," said McPherson, who spoke for about 25 minutes before fielding questions for more than 45 minutes. "If people don't vote, democracy doesn't work. It's as simple as that."
</p>
<p>
  Discussing the results of the November 8 special election, in which voters rejected all eight propositions, McPherson said voters were sending a clear message to the Legislature: "Get your act together, tackle the tough issues facing California," he said.
</p>
<p>
  The initiative process has been "co-opted by special interests" and should be an option of "last resort," said McPherson. "Voters aren't suffering from election fatigue, they're suffering from initiative fatigue," he said, suggesting that the practice of paying signature-gatherers who circulate petitions to get items on the ballot and the threshold for qualifying initiatives for the ballot should be revisited.
</p>
<p>
  Responding to questions about California's new electronic voting machines, McPherson offered assurances that he has imposed the strictest standards in the nation and that the system will have a "paper trail" that will prevent voting for more than the allowed number of candidates and will allow voters to see how they voted before leaving their polling place.
</p>
<p>
  "Once you lose faith in the accuracy of the electoral system, the system isn't any good--people don't have confidence in it," said McPherson.
</p>
<p>
  In other remarks, McPherson said he thinks term limits have created an "ongoing state of flux" in Sacramento and have concentrated power in the executive branch, but he credited them with bringing more women and people of color into the Legislature. He thinks redistricting is "desperately needed in this state," and he said he doesn't see public support for public financing of campaigns, particularly given the state's ongoing budget crunch.
</p>
<p>
  Interim Social Sciences Dean Michael Hutchison introduced McPherson and presented him with a UCSC jacket and golf head covers as a parting gift.

        <title>Sociologist says class-based childrearing patterns perpetuate social inequality</title>

<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  As a sociologist, Annette Lareau wanted to know more about how social inequality gets perpetuated from generation to generation.
</p>
<p>
  She wanted to identify the "mechanisms in daily life that sustain the patterns of inequality" in U.S. society.
</p>
<p>
  Curious about the role of class, Lareau undertook an ambitious study that focused on childrearing practices among racially diverse middle-class, working-class, and poor families.
</p>
<p>
  Two books and countless hours of fieldwork later, Lareau says that although race is important in many aspects of daily life, parenting methods varied by class more than by race in her study. She sums up the differences she saw by saying middle-class parents "see their child as a project, while working-class and poor families put a lot of energy into getting through the day and keeping their children safe."
</p>
<p>
  Lareau uses a gardening analogy to describe her findings, referring to the middle-class style as one of "concerted cultivation," and calling the working-class and poor style "natural growth." While each approach has benefits and drawbacks, middle-class parenting habits foster a sense of entitlement that helps children navigate the educational system from elementary school to college, she said.
</p>
<p>
  Lareau, a UCSC alumna (Merrill '74, sociology) and a professor of sociology at the University of Maryland, discussed her work during a sociology colloquium earlier this month. She is the author of two books, <i>Home Advantage</i> and <i>Unequal Childhoods: Class, Race, and Family Life</i>. She discussed her 1993-95 fieldwork, and a follow-up study 10 years later, with about 30 people who attended the colloquium, "Unequal Childhoods Grown Up: Class, Race, and Family Life," cosponsored by the UCSC Center for Justice, Tolerance, and Community. She is spending a year at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences in Palo Alto.
</p>
<p>
  Middle-class parents actively foster and assess the talents, opinions, and skills of their children, and the organization of daily life reflects that engagement, said Lareau. Parents schedule multiple leisure activities that require a high level of adult interaction, including sports, lessons, and other pursuits. Conversational style involves extended negotiations between parents and children, challenges by children of adult statements, and a back-and-forth dialogue that relies on reasoning and problem solving. Regarding schooling, parents are critical consumers and intervene on behalf of their children, and they train their children to take on that role during their school years. These factors combine to create an emerging sense of entitlement among middle-class children, said Lareau.
</p>
<p>
  Working-class and poor parents care for their children and allow them to grow, but children are expected to find their own recreation in daily life and rarely participate in formal leisure activities. In conversation, parents issue directives and children rarely question or challenge adults. Parents are dependent on institutions, such as schools, to assess the performance of their children, and they rarely develop an independent view of their child's achievement or abilities. Their interactions with institutions, including schools, are marked by a sense of powerlessness and frustration, and they are more distrustful of schools, which Lareau pointed out are "arms of the state." Parents feel especially vulnerable when their childrearing practices conflict with school policies, particularly regarding corporal punishment, she said.
</p>
<p>
  By the age of 10, children are emulating these "informal, taken-for-granted skills of daily life" that Lareau believes contribute to the stratification of society. In the classroom, middle-class children seek individualized tasks and opportunities to "customize" their education, while working-class and poor children tend to work within the framework of activities presented by teachers, said Lareau.
</p>
<p>
  Although middle-class children are more likely to be stressed, childrearing practices that foster the talents and skills of children and encourage them to advocate for themselves "can be extremely powerful at key life moments, like getting into college," said Lareau.
</p>
<p>
  "It's more important than taking your kid to the art museum or exposing children to Beethoven," said Lareau, referring to other behaviors that may reproduce inequality.
</p>
<p>
  Lareau's findings are based on classroom observation in three public schools and in-depth interviews with parents of 88 children aged 9 and 10 and their teachers. She and her research team also did extensive family observations of 12 families that included 20 daily visits within one month and an overnight visit. During the follow-up study, she interviewed the children of the 12 families, as well as parents and others.
</p>
<p>
  The follow-up study with 12 young people was "somewhat depressing. There were no surprises," said Lareau.
</p>
<p>
  More middle-class children graduated from high school than working-class and poor children, they were more likely to have a driver's license, and more went to college. Middle-class parents were more involved with the college-application process and tended to make the final decision regarding where their children would enroll.
</p>
<p>
  Lareau and her fellow researchers found it taxing to traverse the "different class worlds" they encountered during the project. One indication of the contrast was Lareau's failure to find even one middle-class child who was uninvolved in a single organized activity.
</p>
<p>
  Similarly, she said working-class and poor families have much more contact with kin than middle-class families, who are "too busy" to see family. Closer kin relations appears to be a key benefit to children of working-class and poor parents.
</p>
<p>
  Lareau was struck by the emergence of this new middle-class childrearing strategy, with its "frantic pace" that causes children to become bored "in a heartbeat."
</p>
<p>
  "The middle-class parents were not raised this way," she said. "It has emerged in the last 30 to 40 years." Lareau sees the high level of parental intervention as an expression of anxiety as the middle-class scrambles to preserve their position in society.
</p>
<p>
  "Schools are the 800-pound gorilla," said Lareau. "It's hard to find well-paying jobs that don't take you through the college pathway."
</p>
<p>
  Middle-class parents are more attuned to that fact and become very involved in the college-selection process by arranging campus visits, navigating the application process, hiring coaches to help with essays, and more.

<p>
  There's still time to discover your inner Santa Claus. Throughout campus, students, staff, and faculty are organizing to buy holiday gifts for needy families and to help the Second Harvest Food Drive.
</p>
<p>
  Financially struggling UCSC student parents and their children are the focus of the Giving Tree program run by Child Care and Early Education Services.
</p>
<p>
  Each tree--set up in all campus child-care facilities and at other campus locations--features paper ornaments with gift requests. Gift-givers as well as those receiving the gifts remain anonymous under the program. Those wishing to participate may call (831) 459-2967 or e-mail <em><a href="mailto:celinamg@ucsc.edu">celinamg@ucsc.edu.</a></em>
</p>
<p>
  In Environmental Studies, gifts are being gathered for two teen-aged expectant mothers through the Santa Cruz Volunteer Center's <a href="http://scvolunteercenter.com/adopt-a-family/default.asp">Adopt-A-Family program</a>.<br>
  <br>
  "We're all about contributing to the environment around us in many different ways," said Marissa Maciel, faculty services coordinator. "This is a way of bridging the gap between the campus and the community." More information on the program is available by calling (831) 427-5075, or checking the <a href="http://scvolunteercenter.com">web site</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The Christmas Project has become a tradition in many UCSC offices, including the Academic Resources Center. Gifts are provided for children and adults in farmworker families. Longtime Christmas Project participant Larry Trujillo, executive director of student academic support services, will be working with the program again this year. To take part, call Trujillo at (831) 459-3630.
</p>
<p>
  Another tradition is the Toys for Tots drive, collecting new, unwapped gifts at bins in UCSC's fire station and police station. Toys--for newborns to 12-year-olds--may be dropped off at any time from November 28 through December 20. Often, campus holiday parties include toy donations, which will be picked up by firefighters if reqested.
</p>
<p>
  One of the most visible holiday efforts is the Second Harvest Food Drive, which will have a Campus Mail Services truck parked at the main campus entrance from 7:15 to 9:30 a.m. from December 1 to 9 to collect food donations.
</p>
<p>
  Students representing about 20 different student organizations will be going door-to-door in the community this week, dropping off Second Harvest bags for residents to fill with food and donations. The bags will be picked up and the food loaded into the bus.
</p>
<p>
  The students' efforts are being coordinated by the <a href="http://volunteer.ucsc.edu/">Student Volunteer Connection</a>, which also encourages students to donate meals from their meal plans or money from their Flexidollar accounts to help Second Harvest. The donations are coordinated through UCSC Dining Services, and each meal donated provides $19 to Second Harvest.
</p>
<p>
  While food donations are always welcome, donors are also being asked to consider cash donations this year. Cash donations have the benefit of being available for use year-round, and Second Harvest is able to distribute more than $9 worth of food for every dollar donated.
</p>
<p>
  Cosponsored by the Academic Senate and the Staff Advisory Board, the Second Harvest drive has a goal of collecting 50,000 pounds of food--or its equivalent in combined food and cash donations--by December 2.
</p>
<p>
  "The annual holiday food drive is an easy and meaningful way for the campus community to contribute to one of the most basic needs in our community," said Donna Blitzer, UCSC director of government and community relations. "Second Harvest Food Bank supports over 120 local nonprofit agencies that distribute food to almost 45,000 people every month, most of whom are children." Blitzer and Campus Mail Services director Manuel Grijalva are cochairs for the drive.
</p>
<p>
  Checks payable to Second Harvest Food Bank may be sent through interdepartmental mail to Campus Mail Services.

        <title>$4 million in federal funding secured for two major UCSC research programs</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 28 Nov 2005 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>

        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  Funding for two major interdisciplinary research programs led by UCSC has been included in a federal appropriations bill for fiscal year 2006.<br>
  <br>
  The bill has been approved by both houses of Congress.
</p>
<p>
  The bill includes about $2 million for each of the programs: the Center for Integrated Marine Technologies (CIMT), an ongoing effort to improve long-term monitoring of ocean ecosystems, and the Bio-Info-Nano Research and Development Institute (BIN-RDI), a science and technology partnership based in Silicon Valley.
</p>
<p>
  The BIN-RDI is planned as a broad partnership of government, academia, and industry focusing on the convergence of biotechnology, information technology, and nanotechnology. Based at the NASA Ames Research Center at Moffett Field, it is a key component of UCSC's Silicon Valley Initiative.
</p>
<p>
  The BIN-RDI will support both open-exchange fundamental research and industry-supported start-up research aimed at developing breakthrough bio-info-nano fusion technologies. It will also provide an educational test-bed for novel curricula and teaching methodologies to develop a workforce for the future, and will exert national influence on technology policy and investment, said Carl Walsh, UCSC vice provost for Silicon Valley initiatives.
</p>
<p>
  "The BIN-RDI offers a great opportunity to build on UCSC's successful partnership with NASA Ames in the University Affiliated Research Center, while leveraging the research strengths of UC, NASA Ames, and industry to maintain the Silicon Valley's leadership as the global center for innovation," Walsh said.
</p>
<p>
  Congresswoman Anna Eshoo helped get funding for the BIN-RDI included in the appropriations bill.
</p>
<p>
  "I'm very proud to have helped secure federal resources for the Bio-Info-Nano Research and Development Institute," Eshoo said. "This project capitalizes on the very best of NASA Ames, UC Santa Cruz, the entire UC system, and the many other private-sector and academic partners. This effort will launch a new generation of skilled workers and scientists, fostering American innovation in the 21st century. It's exactly what we should be doing to keep America the world's leader in groundbreaking research and technology."
</p>
<p>
  The CIMT, established in 2002, brings together scientists from six partner institutions around Monterey Bay to study the processes that drive California's highly productive coastal ecosystems. The center serves as a regional pilot project for a national integrated ocean observing system, a top priority of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and other federal agencies. Congressional funding for the center dried up after three years, however, and researchers have struggled to keep it running for the past year. The renewed funding comes at a crucial time, said Gary Griggs, director of UCSC's Institute of Marine Sciences and chair of CIMT's board of directors.
</p>
<p>
  "This is really great news, because the Central Coast is one of only a few places in the world with a highly productive coastal upwelling system, and through CIMT we are well on our way to putting in place a coastal observation system and figuring out how this whole system works," Griggs said. "This renewed funding will enable us to continue doing the technology development and integrated long-term monitoring needed to observe trends in the system over time."
</p>
<p>
  Congressman Sam Farr negotiated funds for the program as a member of the House Appropriations Committee.
</p>
<p>
  "Ocean observation provides the foundation of knowledge we need to develop and enact more effective ocean management policies, like ecosystem-based management," Farr said. "CIMT is a critical contributor to this research on both a local and national level, and I am pleased to be able to secure this funding for them."

        <title>Diversity forums draw broad participation from campus community</title>

<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  A free-ranging discussion of diversity on campus touched on issues from the stratospheric cost of living and the needs of the "hidden disabled" to academic curriculum and the concentration of Latino staff in low-level food, custodial, and groundskeeping jobs.
</p>
<p>
  Far broader than a discussion of race and gender diversity, the discussion took place November 18 during the fourth of five public forums sponsored by the Academic Senate's <a href="http://senate.ucsc.edu/caad/">Committee on Affirmative Action and Diversity (CAAD)</a>
</p>
<p>
  In an effort to assess the diversity climate on campus, CAAD designed the gatherings to be information-sharing events that will be followed next quarter by a web-based survey questionnaire. The committee will present its findings in the spring.
</p>
<p>
  Gina Dent, associate professor of feminist studies, facilitated the interactive three-hour session, which included a presentation of current data about the campus. The session, which was recorded for use in compiling the final report, was an opportunity for students, staff, and faculty to offer input, ask questions, express opinions, and help shape the committee's work. About 40 people attended.
</p>
<p>
  "It's easy to treat the language of diversity cynically, to say it's the same as affirmative action but we're just calling it something different," said Dent, who noted that the campus remains legally bound to use affirmative action to comply with federal standards and laws, even in the wake of Proposition 209.
</p>
<p>
  "Or, we could build a more substantive agenda," she said, opening the door to a sweeping discussion of the campus climate.
</p>
<p>
  UCSC is widely perceived by outsiders as having few of the conventional "diversity issues," but Dent called it a "majority-white campus, consistently among the whitest campuses in the UC system, in terms of student population."
</p>
<p>
  Among undergraduates, 51 percent are European American, 18 percent are Asian/Pacific Islander, 14 percent are Hispanic, 11 percent declined to state, 3 percent are African American, 2 percent are international, and 1 percent are American Indian.
</p>
<p>
  Graduate students are 49 percent European American, 16 percent declined to state, 16 percent are international, 9 percent Asian/Pacific Islander, 8 percent Hispanic, 1 percent African American, and 1 percent American Indian.
</p>
<p>
  Campuswide data show undergraduate attrition after three years averages about 30 percent, with higher rates among African American and American Indian students. Campuswide, about 64 percent of students graduate after six years, but the rates are much lower among certain groups, including African American (50 percent), Native American (52 percent), and Mexican American (58 percent). Among Latinos, Filipinos, and Asians, 62 percent graduate after six years.
</p>
<p>
  Several members of the audience said students of color and members of the gay, lesbian, bi, trans, and intersex community have told them they feel uncomfortable and unwelcome at UCSC, and students refer to some colleges as "racist." Dent said some students spoke during forums about their reluctance to walk through certain colleges, while others changed their major because they prefer the environment at some colleges.
</p>
<p>
  Examples of student discontent abound, added Dent: "Undergraduate students demand ethnic studies departments year after year, while faculty consistently say they don't want to create those departments. What can be done creatively so that both constituencies can have what they want?"
</p>
<p>
  Among staff, race and gender diversity remain challenges, she said.
</p>
<p>
  "Staff diversity is considered the biggest problem by the Office of Equal Employment Opportunity and Affirmative Action (EEO/AA)," said Dent.
</p>
<p>
  Seventy percent of staff are white, 20 percent are Latino, 5 percent are Asian/Pacific Islander, 3 percent are African American, 1 percent are American Indian, and 1 percent are unknown, according to campus records.
</p>
<p>
  Forty-one percent of staff are white women, 28 percent are white men, 16 percent are women of color, 14 percent are men of color, and 1 percent are unknown.
</p>
<p>
  Fifty-two percent of Latinos are concentrated in lower-level food, custodial, and grounds jobs, although only 14 percent of job titles on campus are in those categories.
</p>
<p>
  Managers expressed distress that hiring policies effectively discourage the promotion of current staff. One manager described the "wealth of talent in lower-level positions where there is a lot of diversity," but complained about the lack of structure to help people "travel up."
</p>
<p>
  Analysis of faculty data could be enhanced, said Dent.
</p>
<p>
  "Academic HR knows a lot about us as faculty, but more could be generated from the information that's been gathered," she said, citing as one example that promotions and age are not in a format that can be analyzed.
</p>
<p>
  Like staff, ladder-rank faculty are 73 percent white, with 13 percent Asian/Pacific Islander, 7 percent Latino, 3 percent African American, and 1 percent American Indian. Fifty percent are white men, 24 percent are white women, 12 percent are men of color, 11 percent are women of color, and 3 percent are of unknown ethnicity.
</p>
<p>
  By division, the "most extreme gender and ethnic diversity problems in terms of seniority" among faculty are in the Physical and Biological Sciences and Social Sciences--precisely where the bulk of near-term future hires will take place, said Dent. "We could exacerbate that, or we could change it," she said.
</p>
<p>
  Top faculty positions are dominated by white men, while the greatest number of women of color are at the assistant professor level, said Dent. Among top professors systemwide, there appears to be a "barrier step" between Step 5 and Step 6, the top of the scale, she said. "The burden of such a strenuous review results in many faculty choosing to remain at Step 5," said Dent.
</p>
<p>
  The <i>Academic Personnel Manual</i> guidelines for personnel actions were recently revised to encourage faculty to engage in "diversity work," such as mentoring and diversity-oriented research, noted Dent.
</p>
<p>
  Conceding that data are incomplete and sometimes problematic, Dent encouraged discussion of the campus culture. "Data is never going to capture everything we want to know. That's why this is an ethnographic study," she said. "Has the culture changed to accommodate every kind of person present equally?"
</p>
<p>
  A 19-year employee of the campus expressed the frustration of many when she said she has watched the revolving door go around as people from diverse backgrounds work for about two years and leave. "There's something about the climate here that we need to tease apart," she said, issuing a plea for programs that will support a diverse campus community.

<p>
  By the time Camper Van Beethoven first played the Catalyst in downtown Santa Cruz in 1986, the band had already completed a national tour as the opening act for R.E.M.
</p>
<p>
  One of the most influential indie rock bands of the 1980s, the idiosyncratic group-- featuring three UCSC alums--returned to Kresge College in November to give a free concert for UCSC students.
</p>
<p>
  Camper won widespread critical acclaim and took college radio by storm with its first three albums--full of satiric, irony-laced lyrics and a dazzling array of musical influences.
</p>
<p>
  After the band's first album hit the Top 30 in England and its first three recordings all made the Top Ten in <i>Village Voice</i> polls, Camper went on to make its major label debut on Virgin Records in 1989, releasing the landmark album <i>Key Lime Pie</i> before dissolving in 1990 during a tour in Sweden. Following a hiatus of more than a decade, the band got back together in 2002 and last year released a new CD titled <i>New Roman Times</i>.
</p>
<p>
  But it all started at UCSC.
</p>
<p>
  Although the band was conceived in the inland empire of San Bernardino County when guitarist/vocalist David Lowery (B.A. math, Kresge '84) first met bassist Victor Krummenacher (music major, Porter), the two musicians quickly relocated to UCSC where they eventually formed a core band of six members that included drummer Chris Pederson (B.A. philosophy, College Eight '83), violinist/guitarist Jonathan Segel (B.A. music, Porter '85), drummer Chris Molla (B.A. music, Porter '88), and guitarist Greg Lisher, part-owner of the local store Artisans, on the Pacific Garden Mall.
</p>
<p>
  "The last time we played at Kresge was in 1983, outside in front of the laundromat," recalled Lowery after the Kresge show. "We moved to Santa Cruz and that's when the band really developed. I lived at Kresge College in 1980-81 and we all had side projects until Camper Van Beethoven became more popular than all of them. We started playing on campus and then began playing shows at house parties in town."
</p>
<p>
  Lowery added that UCSC and the town of Santa Cruz had a tremendous influence on all of the band members. "I think there was a nexus of people in Santa Cruz who did a lot of interesting things in the late '70s through the '80s--from film and dance, to art and journalism."
</p>
<p>
  Camper began to play regularly in Davis, San Francisco, Berkeley, Sacramento, and Los Angeles. In the summers they went on regional tours, playing gigs at nightclubs in college towns around Arizona and the Southwest. Incorporating a wide variety of innovative musical styles, the band saw itself as an antidote to the punk rock bands of the era.
</p>
<p>
  "We were playing in front of a lot of punk rock bands--people like Jello Biafra and the Dead Kennedys, The Minutemen, and The Meat Puppets all took a liking to us,' said Lowery. "But we dispensed with the dogma of punk. We wanted to play a classic rock for our own generation which included everything from punk rock and early electric music, to ska, British folk music, and West Coast psychedelia, to world and surf music."
</p>
<p>
  "We saw ourselves more in the tradition of Frank Zappa and the Mothers of Invention, Kaleidoscope (founded by David Lindley), Captain Beefheart, and the surf bands that came from the area where we grew up, " Lowery added.
</p>
<p>
  After the band split in 1990, the various members continued to pursue a number of projects. Lowery released six albums with his acclaimed band Cracker and began working as a producer for bands such as Sparklehorse and FSK. Krummenacher, Lisher, Pederson, and late Camper addition David Immergluck (guitar and various stringed instruments) formed the band Monks of Doom, with Immergluck eventually emerging as an in-demand sideman with John Hiatt and the Counting Crows. And Segel established a solo career, as well as leading the bands Hieronymus Firebrain and Jack & Jill.
</p>
<p>
  Lowery said the free UCSC show--cosponsored by the campus radio station KZSC and Kresge College--was part of a brief Bay Area tour that also included performances in downtown Santa Cruz and Monterey. "We like to go to an area and stay for a week," said Lowery. "We're starting to reintroduce ourselves to northern California, the West Coast, and North America."
</p>
<p>
  "I'm still doing Cracker and producing," he added. "And everyone has their own projects. But we still get together to play every few months--this is a lifelong thing for us and an expression of who we are."

        <title>UC Diversity Task Force visits UCSC</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 28 Nov 2005 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  A range of topics--including faculty hiring, retention, and promotion, partner hiring issues, and even the cost of living in Santa Cruz--came up during a diversity task force site visit November 14-15.
</p>
<p>
  The site visit team of UC President Robert C. Dynes's <a href="http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/facultydiversity">Task Force on Diversity</a> met with Chancellor Denice D. Denton, Executive Vice Chancellor David Kliger, the divisional deans, and Graduate Dean Lisa Sloan, UCSC task force representative.
</p>
<p>
  Task force members also met with members of two Academic Senate committees: Affirmative Action and Diversity, and Academic Personnel, as well as with the chair of the Committee on Faculty Welfare. Meetings were also held with Senate Chair Faye Crosby and Vice Chair Quentin Williams, and principal diversity officers Alison Galloway, interim vice provost for academic affairs; Barbara Brogan, assistant vice chancellor; Patricia Hiramoto, Equal Employment Opportunity/Affirmative Action director; and Sandra Chung, linguistics professor.
</p>
<p>
  The visiting team also met with various faculty of color and others over lunch and met informally with some department chairs as well as the deans.
</p>
<p>
  "The visit gave us a chance to evaluate where we are doing well and where we need to pay more attention," said Galloway, adding that faculty retention is one area where the campus needs further work. "However, if any university wants a diverse faculty, it must pay attention to the entire life cycle--from getting students to attend university in the first place; go to graduate school; apply for UC jobs; be selected as candidates; be hired, retained, and promoted; and move into leadership positions."
</p>
<p>
  Anyone with questions, concerns, or comments about the task force may contact Sloan at <a href="mailto:lsloan@ucsc.edu">lsloan@ucsc.edu</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The task force's comprehensive review of faculty diversity efforts throughout the UC system includes site visits to each UC campus. A preliminary report is scheduled for release in January, to be followed by a systemwide summit.

Whale lighting festivities will be at 5:30 p.m. on December 3.[/caption]
<a name="content" id="content"></a><br>
<p>
  The 87-foot blue whale skeleton at Long Marine Laboratory will again brighten the holiday season this year. Fondly known as Ms. Blue, the massive whale skeleton will glow each evening in December at the lab's <a href="http://seymourcenter.ucsc.edu">Seymour Center</a>. It is believed to be the world's largest assembled whale skeleton on public display.
</p>
<p>
  "The holiday lights on Ms. Blue help visitors truly grasp her size--I'm always impressed by the way they show off her magnificence against the dark night," said Julie Barrett Heffington, director of the Seymour Center.
</p>
<p>
  To celebrate the holidays, the Seymour Center will host the Jingle Shells Art and Book Festival on Saturday, December 3, from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., with the festive "whale lighting" scheduled for 5:30 p.m.
</p>
<p>
  The festival features ocean-themed books and gifts, live music, refreshments, free gift-wrapping, and children's activities. Meet artists and authors, shop for unique holiday gifts, and explore the Seymour Center's exhibits, aquarium, and touch tanks. Proceeds directly support marine science education. Entrance fees to the center are waived for children 16 and under during the entire day.
</p>
<p>
  The Seymour Center will also stay open for extended holiday hours until 9 p.m. on Tuesdays, December 13 and 20. From 5 to 9 p.m., visitors can enjoy free admission, holiday treats, free gift-wrapping on Ocean Discovery Shop purchases, and the opportunity to behold the glowing glory of Ms. Blue.
</p>
<p>
  Located on the bluffs overlooking Monterey Bay, Long Marine Lab is dedicated to advancing human understanding of the world's oceans. The lab welcomes visitors to the Seymour Center--come explore the endeavors and discoveries of our scientists and learn about ocean conservation and fascinating careers. The center's exhibits and aquariums feature research conducted by UCSC scientists in the Monterey Bay and around the world.
</p>
<p>
  The Seymour Center at Long Marine Lab is located at the end of Delaware Avenue on the west side of Santa Cruz. Regular public visiting hours are Tuesday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Sunday from noon to 5 p.m. For more information, please call (831) 459-3800 or visit the <a href="http://seymourcenter.ucsc.edu">Seymour Center</a> web site.

<p>
  Two faculty members of the Baskin School of Engineering have been elected Fellows of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). They are J. J. Garcia-Luna-Aceves, Baskin Professor of Computer Engineering, and Darrell Long, Malavalli Professor of Storage Systems.
</p>
<p>
  The IEEE Board of Directors confers this honor on a select group of recipients with an extraordinary record of accomplishments in designated fields. In electing Garcia-Luna-Aceves and Long as IEEE Fellows, the board cited Garcia-Luna-Aceves's "contributions to theory and design of communication protocols for network routing and channel access" and Long's "contributions to storage systems architecture and performance." Both are recognized internationally as leaders in their respective fields.
</p>
<p>
  Garcia-Luna-Aceves heads the Computer Communication Research Group (CCRG) at UCSC. His current research projects focus on wireless networks and Internetworking, including a $5.2 million collaborative project sponsored by the U.S. Army Research Office to develop a general theory of complex and dynamic wireless communication networks.
</p>
<p>
  Garcia-Luna-Aceves is a principal scientist at the Palo Alto Research Center and was formerly a center director at SRI International, a visiting professor at Sun Microsystems Labs, and a principal of protocol design for Nokia. He received the SRI International Exceptional Achievement Award in 1985 for his work on multimedia communications and again in 1989 for his work on adaptive routing algorithms. He coauthored the book <i>Multimedia Communications: Protocols and Applications</i> (Prentice-Hall, 1998) and has published nine U.S. patents and 300 papers on computer communication.
</p>
<p>
  Garcia-Luna-Aceves earned his B.S. in electrical engineering from the Universidad Iberoamericana in Mexico City and his M.S. and Ph.D. in electrical engineering from the University of Hawaii. He joined the UCSC faculty in 1993.
</p>
<p>
  Long serves as associate dean for research and graduate studies in the Baskin School of Engineering and is director of the Storage Systems Research Center (SSRC), a leading center for research on data storage and storage systems. He also serves on a standing committee of the National Research Council on technology and security issues.
</p>
<p>
  Research in the SSRC focuses on caching, storage systems hierarchies, peta-scale storage systems, distributed storage systems, and security and performance. Long has broad research interests in the area of computing systems, including operating systems, distributed systems, high-performance storage systems, fault tolerance, performance evaluation, and mobile computing. He has received an IBM Faculty Award and several IBM Research Invention Achievement Awards. He has more than 125 research publications and numerous patents related to storage systems.
</p>
<p>
  Long earned his B.S. in computer science from San Diego State University and M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in computer science from UC San Diego. He joined the UCSC faculty in 1988.

        <title>United Way names Catherine Cooper a Community Hero</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 28 Nov 2005 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>7696</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  Catherine Cooper, professor of psychology and education, received a Community Hero award from the United Way of Santa Cruz County for her work with Elizabeth Dominguez, director of the Cabrillo Advancement Program at Cabrillo College. Dominguez was also recognized as a Community Hero.
</p>
<p>
  Cooper and Dominguez have collaborated for more than 11 years on the "Bridging Multiple Worlds Alliance." The alliance is devoted to encouraging young people from diverse backgrounds to get on the path to higher education and college-based careers by increasing their awareness of college as an option for them and of the resources that are available to them.
</p>
<p>
  Active in six states, the alliance reaches out to children, beginning with sixth-graders, and works with families, schools, and neighborhood programs to "bridge multiple worlds" and build university/community partnerships that open the academic pipeline to youth of all backgrounds, including those of African, Chinese, Filipino, Latino, European, Japanese, Cambodian, Vietnamese, and Native American descent.
</p>
<p>
  Earlier this year, the alliance and UCSC's Center for Justice, Tolerance, and Community received nearly $1 million from the Kellogg Foundation to support their work promoting educational achievement, economic equity, and environmental justice.
</p>
<p>
  A total of 25 community heroes were recognized for their contributions toward United Way's long-term goals. Cooper and Dominguez were honored for their work helping more Santa Cruz County students graduate from high school job-ready or prepared for higher education. Others were honored for their work in health, the environment (social and natural), the economy, and public safety.

<p>
  Jack Baskin, whose steadfast support led to the establishment and rapid growth of UCSC's Baskin School of Engineering, has been selected for induction into the Silicon Valley Engineering Hall of Fame. The Silicon Valley Engineering Council (SVEC) announced the Hall of Fame winners last week during the group's annual open house at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View.
</p>
<p>
  Baskin and four other distinguished engineering leaders will be formally inducted into the Hall of Fame in a ceremony hosted by the SVEC on February 24, 2006. The Silicon Valley Engineering Hall of Fame recognizes local engineers for outstanding professional achievement and significant contributions to the Silicon Valley community.
</p>
<p>
  The other inductees are Thomas Kailath, Hitachi America professor emeritus at Stanford University; Jerry Sanders, chairman of the board emeritus at Advanced Micro Devices (AMD); Sass Somekh, president of Novellus Systems; and Lotfi Zadeh, professor of electrical engineering and computer sciences at UC Berkeley. Baskin and Sanders were both nominated for this honor by Steve Kang, dean of the Baskin School of Engineering and a former president of the SVEC.
</p>
<p>
  "It is a great pleasure to see these deserving nominees selected for the Hall of Fame," Kang said. "Jerry Sanders is considered one of the architects of Silicon Valley and one of its best CEOs. Jack Baskin's commitment to bettering the community is reflected in both his professional activities and his long history of active involvement and support for engineering at UC Santa Cruz."
</p>
<p>
  Baskin, who earned a B.S. in aeronautical engineering from New York University, built a successful development company that worked on commercial, industrial, and public construction projects throughout California. In 1967, Baskin moved to Palo Alto from southern California and sought to fill what he saw as a serious need for affordable housing in the San Francisco Bay Area. Now retired, he is a leading philanthropist in the Santa Cruz community.
</p>
<p>
  Baskin has been actively supporting engineering programs at UCSC for over two decades, providing guidance to faculty and university leadership as well as generous financial support. In 1997, his gift of $5 million helped launch the Baskin School of Engineering. His donations to the engineering school now total almost $8 million. Baskin, who has served as a UCSC Foundation trustee since 1978, was recently honored as the first recipient of UCSC's "Fiat Lux Award."
</p>
<p>
  "His leadership, support, and guidance in the creation of the Baskin School of Engineering will have a long-term impact through the preparation of students for engineering careers that will enhance the quality of life for many generations to come," Kang said.
</p>
<p>
  Jerry Sanders, the visionary cofounder of AMD, led the company to become one of the leading semiconductor manufacturers in the world. He also cofounded several prominent industry groups, including the Semiconductor Industry Association, the Santa Clara Manufacturing Group, the Semiconductor Research Corporation, SEMATECH, and the Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation.
</p>
<p>
  Sanders earned a B.S. in electrical engineering from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). Kang, who served as professor and department head of electrical and computer engineering at UIUC before coming to UCSC, knew Sanders as one of his department's most distinguished alumni. Sanders endowed a chair in electrical and computer engineering at UIUC in 2001.
</p>
<p>
  The induction ceremony for the Hall of Fame awards is held as part of the SVEC's annual Engineer's Week Banquet in February. Inductees are selected on the basis of professional achievement, service to the profession, and service to the community.
</p>
<p>
  The SVEC, founded in 1989, is an alliance of professional societies in the Silicon Valley representing 30,000 engineers, scientists, and technologists in the region. Its purpose is to assist its member engineering and technical organizations in Silicon Valley to better serve their members and the community.
</p>
<p>
  The Jack Baskin School of Engineering, UCSC's first professional school, has emerged as a distinctive engineering school with a unique focus on the critical areas of information technology, biotechnology, and nanotechnology.

<p>
  UCSC researchers are using the latest in genetic technology to investigate an ancient form of life--the poorly understood microorganisms known as Archaea.
</p>
<p>
  Many Archaea live in hostile environments, from salt lakes to acidic hot springs, but they can be very difficult to grow and study in the laboratory. So UCSC researchers were thrilled when their proposal to sequence the complete genomes of five species of Archaea was approved earlier this year by the Community Sequencing Program of the U.S. Department of Energy's Joint Genome Institute (JGI). JGI will carry out the sequencing and make the results publicly available.
</p>
<p>
  "Having complete genome sequences will be enormously helpful to our research," said Todd Lowe, an assistant professor of biomolecular engineering.
</p>
<p>
  Lowe and Chad Saltikov, an assistant professor of environmental toxicology at UCSC, teamed up with Sorel Fitz-Gibbon of UCLA and Christopher House of Pennsylvania State University to submit the Archaea proposal to the Community Sequencing Program. The five species they proposed for sequencing are closely related heat-loving Archaea found in various hot springs from Iceland to the Philippines. These species belong to a unique group of Archaea that can use sulfur compounds and toxic metals such as arsenic and selenium to power their cells. They use these compounds in much the same way that our own cells use oxygen, Lowe said.
</p>
<p>
  One of Lowe's goals is to identify the genes and metabolic pathways that enable the Archaea to thrive at extremely high temperatures and make use of toxic compounds. His lab investigates the unique biology of Archaea using a combination of laboratory experiments and computational techniques for genetic analysis.
</p>
<p>
  Superficially, Archaea look much like bacteria. It wasn't until about 25 years ago that genetic techniques enabled scientists to see beyond the cell surface and recognize the differences between Archaea and bacteria.
</p>
<p>
  "Archaea are as different from bacteria as bacteria are from us," Lowe said. "They account for a third of the biodiversity on the planet and they've hardly been studied."
</p>
<p>
  Scientists now divide all known organisms into three distinct domains: the eukaryotes, which include all plants, animals, and fungi; the bacteria; and Archaea.
</p>
<p>
  "We're studying a third group of life that we know very little about and that may tell us about the origin of life, how life works, and geochemical processes. It's really exciting," said Aaron Cozen, a graduate student in Lowe's lab.
</p>
<p>
  Archaea have already yielded some useful products, such as heat-resistant enzymes used in laundry detergents. Other practical benefits are likely to emerge from ongoing research on the unusual metabolism and genetics of these organisms, said Saltikov, who is focusing on their metabolic use of arsenic.
</p>
<p>
  The use of naturally occurring arsenic by Archaea and certain types of bacteria has serious consequences in some parts of the world, because the process converts the arsenic to a more toxic form that is also more likely to remain dissolved in water. In Bangladesh, many people have been poisoned by drinking water that is laden with this toxic form of arsenic. Saltikov and others have already found the bacterial gene involved in arsenic respiration, but they have not found a match for this gene in Archaea.
</p>
<p>
  "Archaea may have the same gene, but the sequence is so different that it's not recognizable. Or they may have a completely different metabolic pathway, or an older pathway that leads us to greater understanding of the bacterial mechanism," Saltikov said.
</p>
<p>
  For now, the biggest challenge for Lowe and Saltikov is learning how to grow Archaea and experiment with them in the lab. Many Archaea are poisoned by oxygen and have to be grown in special airtight containers. The heat-loving Archaea that Lowe is studying can only live at near-boiling temperatures and have to be grown in ovens. Keeping the conditions just right can be difficult and expensive, which limits the kinds of experiments researchers can do.
</p>
<p>
  "These Archaea are more difficult than bacteria to grow and keep happy, so there are fewer ways we can assault them to learn about how they respond," Lowe said. He hopes that at least one of the five species chosen for genome sequencing will be easy to grow so it can become a model system for him and other scientists studying Archaea.
</p>
<p>
  DNA microarrays (sometimes called "gene chips") are among the most powerful tools that Lowe is using to study Archaeal biology. Microarrays can provide a comprehensive view of gene activity in cells, revealing which genes are turned on and off in response to different conditions. Lowe's lab has already developed DNA microarrays based on the full genome sequences of two species of Archaea, and he plans to do the same for the five new species that will be sequenced by JGI. Using this "whole genome" approach to study Archaeal biology, he hopes to uncover the secrets that enable these organisms to live at the extreme limits of life on Earth.

<p>
  Jennifer Svihus, a former development officer at UC San Diego, has been named associate vice chancellor for development at UC Santa Cruz.
</p>
<p>
  Svihus will coordinate fundraising efforts campuswide and plans to lay the groundwork for the campus's first comprehensive fundraising campaign. The comprehensive campaign will build on the success of the just-completed Cornerstone Campaign, which exceeded its $50 million goal by $17 million.
</p>
<p>
  At UC San Diego, Svihus was involved in a $1 billion campuswide comprehensive campaign, which is now about three-quarters of the way to meeting its goal. She was senior director of development, with responsibility for the school of medicine and research initiatives, at UC San Diego.
</p>
<p>
  Svihus said she looks forward to working with Chancellor Denice D. Denton to raise money for the priorities outlined at the chancellor's November 4 investiture. Those priorities include strengthening fundraising by increasing productive partnerships on campus and with companies, educational institutions, and governments in Silicon Valley and Monterey Bay.
</p>
<p>
  Svihus plans to meet soon with a cross section of the campus community, including the academic deans. "I'll be assessing our current strengths and where we need to grow to meet the needs of the university," she said.
</p>
<p>
  Before taking the San Diego post in 2002, Svihus was director of development for Community Hospital of the Monterey Peninsula and a development associate at the Monterey Bay Aquarium. She has a bachelor's degree from the University of the Pacific in Stockton with a double major in entertainment management and public relations. Svihus grew up in Carmel.

<p>
  This fall, UCSC assistant art professor Lewis Watts was scheduled to do an artist-in-residency at the Ogden Museum of Southern Art in New Orleans. Although Hurricane Katrina altered that plan, Watts was able to travel to New Orleans for 10 days in October to take photos of the aftermath of the disaster.
</p>
<p>
  Last week, Watts gave a presentation titled "Ghosts in New Orleans" at the Society for Photographic Education Conference at San Jose State University, relating his experiences in New Orleans.
</p>
<p>
  "The effects of the hurricane firsthand are much more intense then any pictures or video could show," Watts noted. "With 80 percent of the population now gone, the city is filled with even more spirits then usual. What I had photographed in the past took on added significance as I observed the altered landscape and what was left behind."
</p>
<p>
  Watts has widely exhibited his photography of the "cultural landscape," primarily of the African American diaspora. Louisiana has been a prominent feature in his work over the years.
</p>
<p>
  "Like many photographers, I've always been attracted to the way Louisiana looks and feels, its unique culture, and its strong artistic tradition," said Watts.
</p>
<p>
  "Louisiana has a terrible environmental legacy that has most affected its poorest residents, and events after the hurricane underscored the racial and economic divide as well," he added. "In Louisiana, like much of the South, the past is never very far below the surface in terms of race, economics, and aesthetics."
</p>
<p>
  Watts is coauthor of <i>Harlem of the West: The San Francisco Fillmore Jazz Era,</i> to be published by Chronicle Books later this month. He has curated a number of visual history public art projects--including a storefront installation on San Francisco's Fillmore Street and historical markers detailing the social and economic effects of the World War II effort on the site of the Kaiser Shipyards in Richmond.

        <title>Alumna Madison Nguyen becomes first Vietnamese American elected to San Jose City Council</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 14 Nov 2005 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_7678" align="alignright" width="230"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/11/nguyen.05-11-14.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7678" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/11/nguyen.05-11-14.jpg" alt="Madison Nguyen is a 1997 history graduate of UCSC.

<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  During her recent run for City Council in San Jose, candidate Madison Nguyen was puzzled by the way her campaign signs were disappearing from signposts.
</p>
<p>
  Confusion turned to pride when she learned why: Young children of Vietnamese descent were removing the signs and taking them to school, boasting, 'Look, it's my last name!'
</p>
<p>
  Nguyen ("Nwin") went on Vietnamese radio to beg residents of District 7 to leave the signs up until after the September election, and she proceeded to win the seat handily, becoming the first Vietnamese American public official in San Jose, home to more Vietnamese residents than any city outside of Vietnam.
</p>
<p>
  For Nguyen, 30, the City Council is a long way from the farm fields of the Central Valley, where she harvested crops as a girl. Born in Vietnam, Nguyen was a young child when her parents fled Vietnam by boat in 1979. The family was at sea for more than a week before being rescued by a Philippine freighter and spent time in a refugee camp before relocating to Arizona under the sponsorship of the Lutheran Church. The Nguyens eventually settled in Modesto, where they were one of four Vietnamese families laboring among Latino farm workers in the agricultural fields of the Central Valley.
</p>
<p>
  "Working in the fields, we were looked down on. We didn't speak much English," recalled Nguyen. "We were working like dogs, and I didn't like the fact that we were looked down on. I didn't want to live my life like that. I decided at a young age that whatever I do in life, I wanted to change that."
</p>
<p>
  Nguyen says she has always been outspoken. "I saw so many things I just did not like, and no one else would speak up," Nguyen said of the injustice she saw around her as a child. Laughing, she acknowledged the benefits of having eight siblings: "My parents were supportive, but with nine kids, if I strayed, basically, that was okay."
</p>
<p>
  Nguyen learned early about government services--and bureaucracy--because her parents volunteered her to translate for newly arrived immigrants. When she turned 18, she became a U.S. citizen and maintained the family tradition of changing her first name. She admits she was inspired to choose Madison by the Daryl Hannah movie <i>Splash</i>, which she watched over and over on video as a child--though her father prefers the association of founding father James Madison.
</p>
<p>
  Nguyen's parents encouraged their children to pursue higher education--eight went on to graduate from college--and Nguyen said UCSC was the perfect school for her.
</p>
<p>
  "I'd heard it was one of the most liberal campuses in California, and that students could voice their opinions without discrimination or being looked down upon," said Nguyen. "It was the right environment for me."
</p>
<p>
  Although UCSC had fewer students of color than some other UC campuses, Nguyen said diversity is about more than numbers. "More important than a diverse student body is an atmosphere where you can say what you want to," she said. "In most of my classes, I was the only Vietnamese American, and maybe there were one or two other Asian Americans, but it was an opportunity to educate the students in our class about our backgrounds and experiences."
</p>
<p>
  She pursued grassroots community activism, marching with farm workers during the drive to unionize strawberry workers, and she enjoyed working with faculty historians Gail Hershatter and Alice Yang Murray and sociology professor Helen Shapiro. "They were pretty amazing women, immersed in the academy but with a realistic approach," said Nguyen.
</p>
<p>
  "I wanted to earn my doctorate and teach at the university level," said Nguyen. "I thought that was my calling until I got into this political scene."
</p>
<p>
  Nguyen organized a "Rock and Vote" concert in San Jose that drew a crowd of nearly 17,000 and registered almost 5,000 new voters. Community leaders encouraged her to run for a vacancy on the Franklin-McKinley School Board. She did, and won. Her visibility increased after she was an outspoken critic of the way the San Jose Police Department handled the 2003 accidental shooting by an officer of a distraught Vietnamese American woman. Last January, when a vacancy opened up on the City Council after a member resigned, Nguyen had the experience and credibility to make a successful run.
</p>
<p>
  "As a professor, you do influence people, but it's a very small circle," said Nguyen. "What I do now, I get to influence people from all walks of life, regardless of class, race, gender."
</p>
<p>
  Forty-five percent of the residents of Nguyen's district are Latino, 35 percent are Vietnamese, and many are recent immigrants who work more than one job to make ends meet. "I don't see race--I see a reflection of myself growing up in Modesto," Nguyen said of her constituents. "I see the struggle and the desire to move forward."
</p>
<p>
  Their needs have been overlooked for years, said Nguyen, who personally knocked on each door in her precinct twice during her grassroots campaign--three or four times, if you count the primary and runoff races.
</p>
<p>
  "People who'd lived there 20 years said they'd never met a candidate before," marveled Nguyen. Asked if she feels she is inspiring a generation of Vietnamese American girls, Nguyen said, "Not just Vietnamese--minorities in general." Children as young as eight years old joined her on the campaign trail after school, and students in high school and college volunteered every day.
</p>
<p>
  Because Nguyen was elected partway through the term, she will begin campaigning again in March. For now, she is concentrating on a "community agenda," with a focus on public safety, renovation of dilapidated community centers, building partnerships with neighborhood associations to improve blighted areas, and getting stalled plans for the first Vietnamese American Cultural Garden off the ground.
</p>
<p>
  "I feel we can do so much good by 2006, and if I'm not re-elected, that's okay," said Nguyen. "I've read a lot of Gandhi, and my favorite quote is, 'You must be the change you want to see in the world.' That's what I want to do. I want to have a positive impact."

<p>
  Donald Osterbrock, professor emeritus of astronomy and astrophysics, has produced a completely revised edition of his classic book <i>Astrophysics of Gaseous Nebulae and Active Galactic Nuclei</i>. Osterbrock collaborated with Gary Ferland of the University of Kentucky to update the book, which has been a standard reference book for astrophysicists for more than 30 years.
</p>
<p>
  The first edition of <i>Astrophysics of Gaseous Nebulae and Active Galactic Nuclei</i> was published in 1989 and was an expanded version of Osterbrock's earlier book, <i>Astrophysics of Gaseous Nebulae</i> (W. H. Freeman & Co., 1974). The new edition was just published by University Science Books.
</p>
<p>
  Gaseous nebulae are the birthplaces of stars--clouds of gas and dust within galaxies where young stars are formed. Different kinds of nebulae are characterized by the radiation they emit. Active galactic nuclei, thought to be powered by supermassive black holes, emit tremendous amounts of energy from the central regions of galaxies.
</p>
<p>
  <i>Astrophysics of Gaseous Nebulae and Active Galactic Nuclei</i> is a graduate-level text and reference book on gaseous nebulae, nova and supernova remnants, and the emission-line regions in Seyfert galaxies, radio galaxies, quasars, and other types of active galactic nuclei. Much of the new data and many of the new images are from the Hubble Space Telescope and some of the largest ground-based telescopes in the world. Two completely new chapters have been added, one on infrared astronomy and the other on x-ray astronomy, reflecting the great advances in these fields.
</p>
<p>
  Osterbrock, a world-renowned research astrophysicist, came to UCSC in 1972 and served as director of Lick Observatory for eight years. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Chicago at its Yerkes Observatory, was a postdoctoral fellow at Princeton University, and was a faculty member at the California Institute of Technology and the University of Wisconsin-Madison. A council member of the National Academy of Sciences, Osterbrock served as president of the American Astronomical Society (AAS) from 1988 to 1990 and was named its Henry Norris Russell lecturer, its highest honor, in 1991. He taught astronomy and astrophysics courses at Caltech, Wisconsin, and UCSC, and many of the current leaders of astrophysical research on nebulae and active galactic nuclei worked with him as graduate students or as postdoctoral research associates.
</p>
<p>
  In addition to his research accomplishments, Osterbrock has written several books on the history of astronomy. In 2002, he received the AAS's LeRoy E. Doggett Prize in the History of Astronomy.

<p>
  After more than a decade of work, a team led by UCSC physicists has completed a major detector subsystem for NASA's Gamma-ray Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST). Completion of the tracking detector is a significant milestone for the telescope project, scheduled for launch in 2007.
</p>
<p>
  The GLAST will give astronomers a powerful new tool for studying the sources of high-energy gamma rays in the universe.
</p>
<p>
  It will help astronomers investigate poorly understood phenomena such as active galactic nuclei, quasars, pulsars, and gamma-ray bursts.
</p>
<p>
  Scientists also hope to learn about the fundamental properties of the universe itself by studying how gamma rays propagate across the universe.
</p>
<p>
  "With GLAST, we can look at gamma rays emitted from the farthest reaches of the universe and study the sources of those gamma rays. We expect that GLAST will see thousands of quasars and related objects," said Robert Johnson, a professor of physics at UCSC and manager of the tracker subsystem for the telescope.
</p>
<p>
  The tracking detector will give GLAST unprecedented sensitivity for detecting high-energy gamma rays and pinpointing their sources in the sky. The design, engineering, and fabrication of the detector was overseen by Johnson and other researchers at the Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics (SCIPP) at UCSC. The project was a collaborative effort involving SCIPP, the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC), and institutions in Italy and Japan.
</p>
<p>
  GLAST will be much more powerful than its predecessor, the EGRET experiment that operated on the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory in the 1990s, Johnson said.
</p>
<p>
  "Currently there is no other telescope that can detect gamma rays within the energy range that GLAST will cover, and it will be 30 to 100 times more sensitive than any previous gamma-ray telescope," he said.
</p>
<p>
  The tracking detector has nearly 900,000 detector channels, each connected to its own amplifier. Packed into 16 compact modules are nearly 80 square meters of solid-state silicon detectors and 576 electronics boards, all supported on a carbon-composite structure. The whole system operates on just 160 watts of power, and it had to be designed to withstand severe vibrations during the rocket launch that will carry the telescope into orbit.
</p>
<p>
  "It is really an unprecedented design for a detector system that will be put into space," Johnson said.
</p>
<p>
  The initial design work for the GLAST detector was begun in 1992 by William Atwood, then at SLAC and now an adjunct professor of physics at UCSC. Johnson began collaborating with Atwood on the detector project in 1994, and in 2000, NASA chose their detector from among several competing designs for the GLAST mission. Three weeks ago, SCIPP scientists and their international team delivered the last of the detector modules to the integration and test team at SLAC, where the modules were installed into the overall instrument structure.
</p>
<p>
  Over the years, many UCSC undergraduates and graduate students have contributed to SCIPP's work on the GLAST project, Johnson said. In addition to Atwood and Johnson, other UCSC faculty involved in the project are Hartmut Sadrozinski and Terry Schalk, both adjunct professors of physics.
</p>
<p>
  High-energy astrophysicists at UCSC and elsewhere are eagerly awaiting the day when GLAST will begin collecting data. GLAST's main instrument, the Large Area Telescope for which the tracking detector was built, will provide unprecedented sensitivity to gamma rays in the energy range of about 20 MeV to about 300 GeV. Other space-based gamma-ray instruments, such as NASA's Swift mission, cover lower energy ranges, while new ground-based instruments will detect higher-energy gamma rays.
</p>
<p>
  "The new generation of ground-based gamma-ray observatories cover complementary energy ranges and will work closely with GLAST," Johnson said. "We are looking forward to quite an exciting time in terms of being able to reach into new energy ranges and hopefully find the answers to fundamental questions about the universe."

<p>
  Satellite images show that, after decades of stability, a major glacier draining the Greenland ice sheet has dramatically increased its speed and retreated nearly five miles in recent years.
</p>
<p>
  These changes could contribute to rapid melting of the Greenland ice sheet and cause the global sea level to rise faster than expected, according to researchers studying the glacier.
</p>
<p>
  A paper describing these findings will be published this month in <i>Geophysical Research Letters</i>. The study focused on the Helheim glacier, one of the largest outlet glaciers in Greenland. Warming air and sea temperatures in the area likely caused the glacier to speed up, said Slawek Tulaczyk, associate professor of Earth sciences and a coauthor of the paper.
</p>
<p>
  The Greenland ice sheet contains enough water to raise global sea levels by 15 to 20 feet. Although the entire ice sheet is unlikely to melt in this century, even a small change in the rate of melting could inundate low-lying coastal plains and add enough fresh water to the North Atlantic to change ocean circulation patterns, Tulaczyk said.
</p>
<p>
  Ian Howat, a doctoral candidate in Earth sciences and first author on the paper, said changes such as this could have dramatic implications for climate models. Scientists use complex mathematical models to predict how climate, sea level, and ocean circulation will change in response to growing levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
</p>
<p>
  "Current models treat the ice sheet like it's just an ice cube sitting up there melting, and we're finding it's not that simple," Howat said.
</p>
<p>
  The researchers used satellite images to determine the movement and retreat of Helheim glacier. Howat tracked the positions of glacial surface features to assess how fast the glacier moved between satellite fly-bys. Satellite images dating back as far as the 1970s show that the front of the glacier has remained in the same place for decades. But in 2001 it began retreating rapidly, moving back four and a half miles between 2001 and 2005. Howat's measurements also show that the Helheim glacier has sped up from around 70 feet per day to nearly 110 feet per day and thinned by more than 130 feet since 2001.
</p>
<p>
  As the glacier speeds up and retreats, new factors come into play that cause further acceleration and retreat, Howat said. "This is a very fast glacier, and it's likely to get faster," he said.
</p>
<p>
  The Helheim glacier is a river of ice that pours from the inland Greenland ice sheet, through a narrow rift in the coastal mountain range, and down into the sea at a rate of several miles per year. In the sea, the glacier's weight keeps it firmly resting on the bottom, as long as the water depth is less than about nine-tenths of the glacier's thickness. Where the water is deep enough to cause the end of the glacier to float, its front becomes brittle and crumbles into icebergs, Tulaczyk explained.
</p>
<p>
  Warming disrupts the delicate balance between glacier thickness and water depth by melting and thinning the glacier. If the glacier thins beyond a critical point, it becomes ungrounded, floats, and rapidly disintegrates. Temperatures in Greenland have increased by more than five degrees Fahrenheit (three degrees Celsius) over the last decade.
</p>
<p>
  "Outlet glaciers may have been thinning for over a decade," Howat said. "But it's only in the last few years that thinning reached a critical point and began drastically changing the glacier's dynamics."
</p>
<p>
  The retreating front of the glacier causes it to move down the mountain slope more rapidly. This thins the glacier further, which causes upstream parts of the glacier to perceive a steeper slope and begin moving faster, Tulaczyk said.
</p>
<p>
  Many fiords, the channels carved by glaciers flowing into the sea, are deep with a shallow lip in front. Once the glacier floats off this shallow pinning point, it retreats into deeper water, making further disintegration likely, Howat said.
</p>
<p>
  Reduced friction between ice and rock at the glacier bed can also increase glacier speed. Fiords often widen inland, causing the glacier to grate less heavily at the fiord walls and move faster as it retreats. And ice crystals in fast-moving glaciers can realign, further reducing friction, Howat said.
</p>
<p>
  The Helheim glacier's speedup has already propagated 12.5 miles up the glacier. The center of the Greenland ice sheet is only 150 miles inland, and the researchers worry that the effects of the glacier's retreat will continue to move inland, ultimately decreasing the thickness of the whole ice sheet.
</p>
<p>
  "If other glaciers in Greenland are responding like Helheim, it could easily cut in half the time it will take to destroy the Greenland ice sheet," Howat said. "This is a process we thought was only happening in Antarctica, and now we're seeing that it happens really fast in Greenland."
</p>
<p>
  Recent studies have shown that many other glaciers in the southern half of Greenland are retreating. To date, only one other glacier, the Jakobshavn Isbrae glacier in the southwest, has been studied sufficiently to determine that it is speeding up as it retreats. But Tulaczyk expects similar mechanisms are at work in other retreating glaciers.
</p>
<p>
  "Our research provides strong evidence that rapid melting processes such as we observed at the Helheim glacier will play a role in ice sheet reduction, but they are currently not included in the models," Tulaczyk said. "My ultimate goal is to convince ice sheet modelers to incorporate this dynamic process in the models."
</p>
<p>
  In addition to Howat and Tulaczyk, the authors of the paper include Ian Joughin of the University of Washington and Sivaprasad Gogineni of the University of Kansas. The research was funded by grants from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the National Science Foundation.

<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  From the organic farms where produce is grown to the compost piles that keep food waste out of the landfill, UC Santa Cruz Dining is at the forefront of environmentally friendly college food programs.
</p>
<p>
  New guidelines mandate the purchase of organic, locally grown produce, the recycling of used cooking oil, the use of "paper" plates that are actually made of recyclable sugarcane fiber, and more.
</p>
<p>
  These initiatives are already benefiting local farmers, local businesses, and the environment, according to Scott Berlin, associate director of UC Santa Cruz Dining.
</p>
<p>
  "We are directly impacting individuals and the local economy," said Berlin. "We are creating new markets and helping preserve agriculture on the Central Coast."
</p>
<p>
  Because of its $4.5 million annual food budget, the way UCSC Dining does business has major impacts. Among the milestones Berlin cited:
</p>
<p>
  * Twelve percent of the produce served in campus dining halls last year was organic, six times the target set for the program's first year; organic production reduces the use of chemical pesticides and fertilizers.
</p>
<p>
  * This fall, when UCSC started buying fresh, locally grown certified organic produce from an organization that partners with family farms and trains farm workers to run their own operations, the group's output increased by 300 percent in a single month.
</p>
<p>
  * By signing a contract with a local food distribution business, instead of the national distributor that previously held the contract, UCSC is bolstering the local economy.
</p>
<p>
  * Buying locally produced food helps the environment by reducing fossil-fuel consumption and air pollution; consolidating produce deliveries reduces the number of vehicles on campus.
</p>
<p>
  "Santa Cruz is at the forefront of sustainability efforts in the UC system," said Berlin, who came to UCSC from the San Diego campus, where he was a food service manager.
</p>
<p>
  And menus are changing, too.
</p>
<p>
  "Our chefs are getting creative with all these vegetables," noted Berlin, touting roasted-vegetable pizzas, vegetarian lasagna, and potato-leek soup as among the new entrees.
</p>
<p>
  The campus's leadership in sustainable dining is the result of work by a visionary group of students, staff, and faculty who worked together to create a full menu of dining-related programs focused on environmentally and socially sound purchases and practices.
</p>
<p>
  Tim Galarneau, who graduated from UCSC in June, was the campaign coordinator for Students for Organic Solutions and a representative of the Campus Food Systems Working Group (CFSWG), both of which were instrumental in bringing about the policy changes. He and others hope their success at UCSC will serve as a model for other campus food service programs.
</p>
<p>
  "UCSC Dining has raised the bar by addressing the social and economic impacts of food purchasing within the University of California," said Galarneau. "We hope it will inspire programs across the country to follow suit."
</p>
<p>
  The changes coincided with the campus's <a href="http://currents.ucsc.edu/03-04/06-14/dining.html">transition to university-run dining facilities,</a> finalized in June 2004, and they build on other "greening" efforts, including a successful organizing drive by students to introduce <a href="http://currents.ucsc.edu/03-04/09-22/coffee.html">organic fair-trade coffee</a> in the dining halls.
</p>
<p>
  A campuswide survey last spring that generated 3,000 responses asked if students would be willing to pay more annually for meal plans to cover the costs of more sustainable operations. The majority said yes, according to Berlin.
</p>
<p>
  That endorsement, which covered food purchasing guidelines as well as social justice issues such as union labor, gives credence to the campus's initiatives, said Berlin.
</p>
<p>
  "It was the right thing to do, given the campus's philosophical and academic mission, and it's our job to marry that with fiduciary responsibility and keep room-and-board rates as low as possible," he said.
</p>
<p>
  As part of its outreach and education efforts, UCSC Dining publicizes its waste-reduction efforts by presenting "facts to chew on." The Waste Reduction Committee produced a flyer illustrating the scope of the food waste problem: Based on a one-day sample of food waste generated by a single dining hall during the lunch hour, the committee calculated that patrons of UCSC's five dining halls could generate more than 50 tons of food waste annually just during lunch time.
</p>
<p>
  The dining operation is reducing landfill waste by donating leftover food to the Second Harvest Food Bank, adjusting inventory levels and portion sizes to minimize overpreparation, preparing foods to order whenever possible, using vegetable and meat trimmings for soup stock, and rendering used grease, fat, and cooking oil.
</p>
<p>
  More changes are in the works. The installation of a pulper at College Eight next month will reduce waste at the dining hall by 80 percent, added Scott Berlin, a member of the California Restaurant Association (CRA). The local chapter of the association is poised to launch a biodiesel operation, and the campus will contribute used oil as soon as that gets off the ground, he said.
</p>
<p>
  For local farmers, the contract with the nonprofit Agriculture and Land-Based Training Association (ALBA) provides access to the potentially lucrative university market.
</p>
<p>
  "Small farmers are daunted by the purchasing requirements of public universities," said Candy Berlin, program coordinator of UCSC Dining. "For organic farmers to be able to participate in a contract of this size is huge."
</p>
<p>
  Among the local farms supplying fresh organic produce through the ALBA are Coke Farm, Phil Foster Ranches, Happy Boy Farms, New Natives/Greensward Nurseries, Swanton Berry Farms, and the UCSC Farm operated by the Center for Agroecology & Sustainable Food Systems.
</p>
<p>
  The Berlins agree that most of the credit goes to UCSC students, who really pushed for changes in the dining operation.
</p>
<p>
  "A lot of colleges are coming to us and asking, 'How did you make this happen?'" noted Candy Berlin. "It's really the students who deserve the credit. They are not only activists, they're willing to work. They'll scrape plates and gather statistics and information. They're not just making demands."

        <title>Cinderella returns to UCSC for holiday season</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_7664" align="alignright" width="230"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/11/shakespeare.05-11-14.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7664" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/11/shakespeare.05-11-14.jpg" alt="Shoshana Brooks plays Cinderella in the Shakespeare Santa Cruz production.

<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  Shakespeare Santa Cruz celebrates the holiday season with a return of its acclaimed musical version of <i>Cinderella</i> November 18 through December 18 at the UCSC Theater Arts Mainstage
</p>
<p>
  <i>Cinderella: A New Telling of an Old Tale</i> was created for Shakespeare Santa Cruz by Paul Whitworth and Kate Hawley, with music composed and arranged by Gregg Coffin. The show opened to rave reviews in its 1999 world premiere and sold out again in 2000.
</p>
<p>
  Whitworth, artistic director of Shakespeare Santa Cruz and director of <i>Cinderella</i>, is well known to audiences in the Bay Area and beyond for his work as both an actor and director. Hawley, playwright and lyricist for the production, also wrote the enormously popular holiday shows <i>Gretel and Hansel</i> and <i>The Princess and the Pea.</i>
</p>
<p>
  This creative version of the beloved fairy tale features extravagantly outlandish costumes by B. Modern, exuberant choreography by Terry Barto, and spectacular sets by Dipu Gupta. Director Whitworth promises that all the colorful characters will be back: Cinderella, Prince Charming, Little Bo Peep and her very naughty sheep, along with the Ugly Stepsisters (Regan and Goneril) and Cinderella's astonishingly awful Stepmother, Mrs. Baden-Rotten.
</p>
<p>
  The story of Cinderella has been a treasured folktale for many years; over 300 versions had been collected from all over the world by 1893, including one published in 1697. It also has long been a favorite subject for "pantomime," a form of theater unique to England that employs humor and music to tell a traditional fairy tale. Shakespeare Santa Cruz's <i>Cinderella</i> blends English pantomime with the American musical to create a charmingly unique entertainment.
</p>
<p>
  The <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> noted that the company's <i>Cinderella</i> "hits the sweet spot that's so often missed in family shows. Intelligent and buoyant, lyrical and silly, it plays to real people instead of an age-targeted, holiday-market demographic." The <i>San Jose Mercury News</i> added: "Shakespeare Santa Cruz proved that intelligence is not <i>verboten</i> in the usually saccharine world of holiday entertainment with its wittily interactive <i>Cinderella</i>."
</p>
<p>
  The November 18 special preview price is $18. Tickets for all other shows are $18/$14 for children age 12 and younger, $26/$21 for seniors/students/UCSC staff, and $32/$27 for the general public.
</p>

<p>
  The community is invited to attend a free public talk by California Secretary of State Bruce McPherson at 4 p.m. on Thursday, November 17, in the Colleges Nine and Ten Multipurpose Room at the UCSC.
</p>
<p>
  McPherson will deliver a talk entitled "The Importance of Voting in the Democratic Process," as the Social Sciences Division's Distinguished Guest Lecture, before taking questions from the audience.
</p>
<p>
  A former legislator from Santa Cruz, McPherson served in the state Assembly from 1993 until 1996 and in the state Senate from 1996 until 2004. He became the 30th secretary of state of California on March 30, 2005. A Republican, McPherson is known as a fiscal conservative and a social liberal.
</p>
<p>
  "The Social Sciences Division's Distinguished Guest Lecture is intended to provide a public forum for civil discourse on issues that are important to students, faculty, and the community," said interim social sciences dean Michael Hutchison. "As secretary of state, Bruce McPherson will oversee the redistricting of California and can offer insight into many issues facing the state."
</p>
<p>
  For questions, contact Tricia Lyall in the Social Sciences Dean's Office at (831) 459-3212 or via e-mail at <a href="mailto:tdlyall@ucsc.edu">tdlyall@ucsc.edu</a>.

<p>
  A delegation from Hokkaido Information University officially renewed its association with UCSC on November 7 at a formal signing ceremony at University House.
</p>
<p>
  Satoru Ino, president of the Hokkaido Information University, and UCSC Chancellor Denice D. Denton signed a memorandum of understanding renewing for another five years the cooperative agreement that has been in effect since 2002.
</p>
<p>
  "On behalf of HIU I am pleased that I have carried out my responsibility and also appreciate the precious opportunity you have offered to us," said Ino following the signing. "You have kindly accepted our exchange students and offered intensive language and culture courses to our students for the past few years," he added.
</p>
<p>
  "This is the first memorandum of understanding I've signed since I've been chancellor," said Chancellor Denton. "I'm very happy the memorandum of understanding is with Hokkaido Information University."
</p>
<p>
  The timing of the Japanese delegation's visit allowed the visitors to witness Chancellor Denton's investiture ceremony and participate in the Scholarships Benefit Dinner on November 5. The group was also able to visit the surrounding area, including Monterey and the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. Ino, a structural engineer, was especially interested in seeing the bridge.
</p>
<p>
  Under the agreement between Hokkaido and UCSC, dozens of students from Japan have taken part in summer programs that combine English language, cultural, and technical instruction.
</p>
<p>
  Last month, UCSC engineering dean Steve Kang and UCSC professor Ira Pohl took part in an international forum at Hokkaido Information University on the development of information technology specialists at the university level. Kang joined Chancellor Denton in greeting the visitors at University House.
</p>
<p>
  While the signing ceremony was formal, there were some lighter moments afterward, such as when Chancellor Denton displayed a hand-blown glass banana slug, and inquired about the Japanese term for banana slug: <i>namekuji</i>.

<p>
  David Haussler, professor of biomolecular engineering and director of the Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering (CBSE), will speak at the opening session of the 2005 World Technology Summit this week in San Francisco.
</p>
<p>
  Haussler, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator, will discuss health, medicine, and biotechnology. His talk is one of six technology overviews by leaders in various fields on Monday, November 14, the opening day of the summit. Haussler will also take part in a panel discussion of the technology overviews moderated by Adam Lashinsky, senior writer for <i>Fortune</i> magazine.
</p>
<p>
  The two-day summit is organized by the World Technology Network, which brings together individuals and companies deemed by their peers to be the most innovative in the science and technology world. Areas of interest range from information technology and communications to biotech, energy, materials, and space, as well as related fields such as finance, marketing, policy, law, design, and ethics.
</p>
<p>
  The annual World Technology Summit concludes on Tuesday evening with the World Technology Awards. The awards are the culmination of a global judging program through which new members are nominated and selected. Haussler, as one of six finalists in the category of information technology software, is a new fellow of the World Technology Network and is eligible for the award in his category. Winners will be announced at the ceremony Tuesday night.
</p>
<p>
  "This year's group of fellows represent what is imminent, possible, and important in and around emerging technologies," said James P. Clark, founder and chairman of the World Technology Network.
</p>
<p>
  Haussler's genome bioinformatics group at UCSC participates in collaborative efforts to produce, assemble, and annotate the first mammalian genomes. His group designed and built the program that assembled the first working draft of the human genome sequence from information produced by sequencing centers worldwide and helped produce the finished sequence. The group also created the UCSC Genome Browser, a powerful web-based tool for investigating the genome sequences of humans and other organisms. Haussler's ongoing research addresses a range of questions in comparative and evolutionary genomics.

<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  UCSC generally does better than the UC system overall in hiring a diverse faculty, but there is plenty of room for improvement.
</p>
<p>
  That was one of the conclusions Friday at an update on the <a href="http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/facultydiversity/">UC President's Task Force of Faculty Diversity</a> presented by UC President Robert C. Dynes and Lisa Sloan, vice provost and dean of Graduate Studies.
</p>
<p>
  The update was one of three sessions focusing on a different aspect of diversity as part of the <a href="http://currents.ucsc.edu/05-06/11-07/symposium.asp">Achieving Excellence through Diversity symposium</a> November 3-4.
</p>
<p>
  The task force is in the midst of a comprehensive review of faculty diversity efforts at each UC campus. The study will include site visits to each UC campus, with UCSC to be visited on November 14-15. A preliminary report is scheduled for release in January, to be followed by a systemwide summit.
</p>
<p>
  On Friday, Sloan offered what she called "a flavor of the data right now." In offering a breakdown of the 130 ladder-rank faculty members hired at UCSC since 1994-95, Sloan cautioned that the small numbers involved meant that even one hire sometimes caused noticeable fluctuations.
</p>
<p>
  "UCSC hired a higher percentage of women faculty relative to UC as a whole," said Sloan, adding that in most years the campus also hired a greater percentage of African American as well as Latino faculty than the UC systemwide. The situation for hiring of Asian faculty was less clear, she said.
</p>
<p>
  Sloan included a look at the hiring pool itself, since that is a key starting point in diversity efforts. In the life sciences, where women and underrepresented minorities are often scarce, "we hired double what the represented pool looked like," Sloan said. In education, hiring also exceeded the proportion of women and underrepresented minorities in the pool. Physical sciences hiring was at about the same level as the pool. In the humanities and social sciences, which the data group together, UCSC hired at greater levels than the pool for underrepresented minorities and minorities, but hired women at lower levels than in the hiring pool and UC-wide.
</p>
<p>
  Sloan also compared faculty leadership in 2000-01 to 2004-05 with that in July of 2005. Faculty leadership was defined as the executive vice chancellor, vice provost of academic affairs, vice provost and dean of undergraduate education, the five academic deans, the graduate dean, and the Academic Senate chair and vice chair.
</p>
<p>
  In the earlier years, white males held 69 percent of leadership positions, white women held 22 percent, and male minorities, 9 percent.
</p>
<p>
  By July of 2005, however, white males and white females each held 43 percent of the leadership positions, with minority males at 14 percent.
</p>
<p>
  The "minority" category includes women, underrepresented minorities, and Asians, Sloan said.
</p>
<p>
  During the question-and-answer period following the presentation, Pedro Castillo, associate professor of history, said the data would be more helpful if it indicated the numbers of African American faculty and Chicano-Latino faculty hired. "That would give us a different take on this," he said. (To view the PowerPoint presentation with this information added, go to <a href="http://currents.ucsc.edu/05-06/11-07/sloan_presentation.mov">http://currents.ucsc.edu/05-06/11-07/sloan_presentation.mov</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Castillo noted the demographics of the state and that the University of California is a state institution. "As a goal, the faculty should reflect the community out there."
</p>
<p>
  Offering no argument, Dynes said, "I need some ideas as far as how to get there."
</p>
<p>
  UC Riverside Chancellor Frances Cordova emphasized the importance of "growing our own"--finding ways to support and encourage struggling students--a concept noted at other symposium events. "This is something we really need to work with," she said, adding that it is a factor in low graduation rates, among other problems.
</p>
<p>
  Echoing that approach, lecturer Roz Spafford said efforts to help students having difficulty with English have been underfunded, but are vital to increasing diversity.
</p>
<p>
  Assistant theater arts professor Alma Martinez observed that once some women or minorities are hired, more are likely to be drawn to campus. "What works is when there are people of color, it draws more people of color."
</p>
<p>
  Manuel Pastor, professor of Latin American and Latino studies, proposed a "target of opportunity" hiring program that would allow the campus to pursue up-and-coming academics from diverse backgrounds even if there is not a specific faculty vacancy.
</p>
<p>
  Dynes said California's Proposition 209, which bars use of race or gender preferences in hiring and admissions, was the "elephant in the room."
</p>
<p>
  In light of that, Dynes suggested that campuses take a broader approach to hiring, rather than keeping within narrow disciplines. In a very narrow search, "you'll end up with the faculty recruiting playmates," he said. Expanding the scope of hiring is more likely to result in diversity, Dynes said.
</p>
<p>
  Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor David Kliger said the faculty needs to hear "why it is in their interest" to increase diversity.
</p>
<p>
  Reflecting on his own interest in diversity, Dynes told the gathering about a small, but very successful, mentoring program for minorities he took part in during the 1970s when he was at Bell Labs, before joining the University of California. "Here it is 2005, an we're still struggling with the same issue."
</p>
<p>
  As chancellor of UC San Diego, Dynes made himself the chief diversity officer. "I had a group of people who had my sword," to go after the problem. "When they were sandbagged, which they were, I'd open the door for them."
</p>
<p>
  While some people think they have a "silver bullet" to achieve diversity, Dynes said it is a multifaceted problem. "The issues run from pre-K to faculty," he said, citing the comprehensive review admissions program and UC efforts to increase the number of science and math teachers as steps in the right direction.

<p>
  November 7, 2005<br>
</p>
<p>
  To Shirley Ann Jackson, nothing less than the future of the nation is at stake as campuses and the nation grapple with issues of diversity and excellence.
</p>
<p>
  "We must mine the talent pool--globally and nationally," said Jackson, president of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, N.Y.
</p>
<p>
  Jackson delivered the <a href="http://www.rpi.edu/president/speeches/ps110305-santacruz.html">keynote address</a> on the first day of the Achieving Excellence Through Diversity symposium, on Thursday and Friday, part of the celebration of the investiture of Denice D. Denton as UCSC's ninth chancellor.
</p>
<p>
  Before her talk, UC Santa Cruz Foundation president Anuradha Luther Maitra presented Jackson with the third UC Santa Cruz Foundation Medal, recognizing individuals whose achievements illustrate the ideals and vision of UCSC.
</p>
<p>
  A physicist who headed the Nuclear Regulatory Commission from 1995 to 1999, Jackson said the lack of diversity in science and engineering is especially critical. The United States is seeing a slowdown in its skilled labor force just as other nations are increasing their investment in education, she observed. "These trends threaten our global leadership and our national security."
</p>
<p>
  "I speak frequently about innovation and discovery," Jackson said. "Innovation to meet challenges is enhanced by diversity." History is full of examples of converging cultures bringing about discoveries and advances that benefit mankind, she said.
</p>
<p>
  Jackson served on the National Academy of Sciences committee that recently issued a report on American competitiveness in a changing global environment, <a href="http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11463.html">"Rising Above The Gathering Storm: Energizing and Employing America for a Brighter Economic Future."</a> She also serves on several corporate boards of directors.
</p>
<p>
  Jackson said American corporations have already recognized the benefits of diversity. "Corporations, in large part, do not need convincing. Corporations are embracing diversity because it is essential to maintain their market edge."
</p>
<p>
  Higher education is another story, she said. "It is the universities many times where I find the greatest resistance to change."
</p>
<p>
  Jackson cited successful campus strategies, such as slowing the tenure clock to promote a more family-friendly atmosphere and creating "critical clusters" to attract women and underrepresented minorities.
</p>
<p>
  "The issue of faculty searches is a critical one," she said, adding that she is very involved in faculty searches at Rensselaer. "This is where so many women and so many minorities never see the light of day."
</p>
<p>
  Jackson urged the campus to move beyond simply adding people from different backgrounds, however. "Just throwing people together does not necessarily inspire innovation," she said, suggesting that a sense of community as well as leadership and excellence were required.
</p>
<p>
  She also encouraged the audience to talk about diversity. "Diversity and discussions of it can be turbulent, messy, and uncomfortable," she said, "but they can also be illuminating."
</p>
<p>
  A panel discussion following the speech reinforced the call for dialogue. Jackson joined the panel, composed of Neferti Tadiar, associate professor of history of consciousness; Manuel Pastor, professor of Latin American and Latino studies; and Luther Maitra, who is CEO of Floreat, Inc., as well as president of the UC Santa Cruz Foundation.
</p>
<p>
  Talking about diversity can be hard, Pastor said, but "that is the only way we'll come to the real common ground in the future."
</p>
<p>
  Fielding questions from the audience, panelists were encouraged to continue the dialogue, especially by participating in a series of diversity forums beginning today. (See <a href="http://currents.ucsc.edu/05-06/11-07/brief-diversity.asp"><i>Currents</i> story)</a>
</p>
<p>
  California is on the cutting edge of rapid demographic change--it became a "majority minority" state in 1999--but "California is also at the cutting-edge of inequality," Pastor said. "The University of California has a big role in addressing these inequalities by opening up the system," he added.
</p>
<p>
  Tadiar noted that while in some ways the world seems smaller than ever, "devastating gulfs" between continents and even neighborhoods persist.
</p>
<p>
  Panelists also offered their own takes on the symposium theme of "Excellence Through Diversity."
</p>
<p>
  "I always think about diversity <i>through</i> excellence," said Pastor.
</p>
<p>
  The key question is not excellence through diversity, said Maitra, but "how do we get to diversity through excellence?"
</p>
<p>
  The questions and ideas kept coming on the second day of the symposium, as students, staff, and faculty gathered at the University Center for breakout sessions on three topics related to diversity.
</p>
<p>
  In opening remarks, Angela Davis shared some ambivalence over Rosa Parks's casket being viewed in the U.S. Capitol Building. Davis, who grew up in Alabama not far from the civil rights icon, said some Americans see the Rosa Parks story as a symbol that racial divides are a thing of the past. "Her story is one of discrimination overcome, of wrongs righted, of democracy triumphant," Davis said, but the struggle continues.
</p>
<p>
  UCSC alumnus and actress Adilah Barnes, who portrays Angela Davis as part of a one-woman show, recalled that she was bused across town to a mostly white school as a child in California. "The byproduct of diversity in that situation was acceptance. It was not my skin color that mattered most, but my character," Barnes said.
</p>
<p>
  "Diversity is something I've fought for, and been a recipient of, all my life," she said. "I urge you all to keep the dialogue going after this week and to become agents of change on this campus."
</p>
<p>
  Chancellor Denice D. Denton also urged the audience not to shy away from talking about diversity. "We don't learn without engaging in difficult, challenging, discussions," she said.
</p>
<p>
  The gathering then split into three groups. The first, "What is Diversity? Thinking at the Edge," was led by Student Union Assembly Diversity Officer Takita Salisberry; astronomy graduate student Kirsten Howley; and Andrea Monroe of the Equal Employment Opportunity/Affirmative Action Office. Summarizing the discussion later to the entire group, Salisberry said they discussed what diversity means, including such categories as age, race, and class, and put the greatest emphasis on race and ethnicity. The group also encouraged a wider conversation over issues of diversity.
</p>
<p>
  The second session, "Teaching to a Diverse Student Body," looked at what goes on in the classroom, from sharing knowledge to helping students feel comfortable to participate. Activities outside the classroom were also supported, as part of a way to encourage students not to become too focused on their own areas of study. Such structural issues as financial aid and ethnic studies were explored, and opportunities for student involvement in the diversity dialogue were endorsed. Francisco Hernandez, vice chancellor of Student Affairs, offered opening remarks, and Ruth Harris-Barnett, director of the Center for Teaching Excellence, was the facilitator.
</p>
<p>
  The third session, "Update on the UC Faculty Diversity Study," was led by UC President Robert C. Dynes and Lisa Sloan, vice provost and dean of Graduate Studies. It offered an early look at some of the figures on faculty diversity that are part of the UC President's Task Force on Faculty Diversity. (See <a href="http://currents.ucsc.edu/05-06/11-07/update.asp"><i>Currents</i> story.</a>
</p>
<p>
  Summing up, symposium chair William Ladusaw encouraged students, staff, faculty, and administrators to continue to discuss the issues raised at the symposium. "It needs to become the normal operating process. We need to grow routinely comfortable with the discomfort."

<p>
  The David and Lucile Packard Foundation has awarded a major grant to researchers at UCSC and other institutions to study fisheries in the northern Gulf of California.
</p>
<p>
  The $1.3 million grant funds a collaborative project to help local Mexican fishers and government officials understand and manage marine resources using cutting-edge fisheries science.
</p>
<p>
  The project is an interdisciplinary effort that will combine social science, fisheries science, and outreach programs to promote the sustainability of fisheries in the Gulf of California. Peter Raimondi, professor and chair of ecology and evolutionary biology, will lead UCSC's participation in the project, along with Giacomo Bernardi and Mark Carr, both associate professors of ecology and evolutionary biology. The project also involves researchers at the University of Arizona and three Mexican institutifin Foundation, of which about $7 million will go to UCSC).

        <title>Corporate self-regulation falls short, says author</title>

<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  When global justice activists took to the streets in the late 1990s to demand reforms such as higher wages and better working conditions for laborers around the world, corporate strategists saw the writing on the wall: Adopt voluntary codes of conduct or face increased government regulation. They opted for self-regulation.
</p>
<p>
  That response, and similarities to the corporate reaction two decades earlier to calls for corporate accountability, is critiqued by UCSC doctoral candidate James K. Rowe in a chapter of the new book <i>Globalization, Governmentality and Global Politics: Regulation for the Rest of Us?</i> (London: Routledge, 2005) by UCSC politics professor Ronnie Lipschutz.
</p>
<p>
  The book examines social and environmental regulation in an era of globalization; Rowe's is the only chapter not written by Lipschutz.
</p>
<p>
  Rowe's contribution, entitled "Corporate Social Responsibility as Business Strategy," analyzes the corporate response to the global justice movement, from intent to impact, over a 40-year span.
</p>
<p>
  "Corporate social responsibility isn't about business ethics," said Rowe. "It's a business strategy meant to forestall popular power that might result in effective regulation. If corporations were serious about social responsibility, why do they oppose having responsibilities formalized in law by regulation?"
</p>
<p>
  Rowe calls the global justice movement the "second wave" of public outcry over corporate malfeasance. The first wave took place in the 1960s and 1970s, when revelations about corporate corruption, tax evasion, and involvement in clandestine political activities, including the U.S.-backed coup that ousted Chilean president Salvador Allende, fueled populist attempts to rein in corporate power and increase accountability. In 1976, the United Nations began negotiating a binding international code of conduct for corporations.
</p>
<p>
  Despite that wave of public pressure, deregulation accelerated under the administration of President Ronald Reagan, and corporate profits soared as global markets opened up in the 1990s under free-trade agreements negotiated by President Bill Clinton. Negotiations on the UN code stalled permanently in 1981, after it had been made voluntary instead of binding.
</p>
<p>
  Driven by their legally binding quest to generate profits, corporations fanned out around the globe in search of cheap labor and lax environmental standards, according to Rowe. The accompanying "race to the bottom" of social, environmental, and human rights protections has contributed to "morbidly low wages, deforestation, and climate change," he said.
</p>
<p>
  History shows that in the absence of strong government regulation, corporate responses to populist movements have minimal impact, said Rowe.
</p>
<p>
  "If voluntary efforts worked, there would have been no second wave," said Rowe. "Empirical studies of corporate codes of conduct show that they fall short."
</p>
<p>
  As revelations of sweatshop conditions swept the garment-manufacturing industry in the early 1990s, consumers expressed displeasure, and business promised to do better. In one high-profile case, Kathie Lee Gifford tearfully vowed to make amends after media reports revealed that child labor was used in the production of garments sold under Gifford's label.
</p>
<p>
  Only government regulations can force corporations to internalize costs that are currently passed on to society, said Rowe, pointing out that low wages force workers to rely on the state for help with housing and other basic needs. Similarly, the absence of strict environmental regulations ensures that the costs of corporate pollution get passed on to taxpayers, who end up footing the bill for cleanup and restoration.
</p>
<p>
  At the turn of the millennium, activists and organizations such as Amnesty International, Friends of the Earth, and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions were willing to work with corporations to develop voluntary codes of conduct hoping they would improve wages, working conditions, and environmental degradation.
</p>
<p>
  Just as the global justice movement was poised to make great strides, the September 11 terrorist attacks shifted attention and resources away from concerns about corporate behavior, said Rowe. Recently, however, as the movement regains momentum, he has detected signs that organizers have learned from history and are changing strategy.
</p>
<p>
  "The consensus now is that voluntary corporate social responsibility isn't working," he said. "I think organizers are ready to bring government back into the marketplace to protect workers and the environment. If they want protections, they have to push for binding regulations. You can't rely on the market to cure the market's ills."

<p>
  Renowned Harvard physicist Lisa Randall spoke to more than 100 Watsonville High School students enrolled in physics classes last Wednesday as part of an outreach event to help celebrate the investiture of UCSC chancellor Denice D. Denton.
</p>
<p>
  After a brief presentation of her background and work, Randall fielded questions from the 15- to 18-year-old students, ranging from her goals and influences to more detailed queries about black holes and string theory.
</p>
<p>
  When asked, "what is the greatest goal you wish to achieve with your career?" Randall received applause when she quickly responded: "to change the world."
</p>
<p>
  "I'd like to see more people interested in science and I want people to know that all kinds of people can become scientists," she added.<br>
  <br>
  Randall ran through the qualities that make a good scientist--including curiosity about how things work and fit together, perseverance, and the ability to admit when you are wrong and try something else.
</p>
<p>
  "Math is also really important," Randall told the students. "You want to learn as much math as you can--it's really useful in anything that you do. Reading is essential too," she added, "it's a great way to engage your imagination."
</p>
<p>
  The event was cosponsored by UCSC Arts & Lectures and the Cultural Council of Santa Cruz County. The students prepared for Randall's visit by spending the past two weeks learning about principles of modern physics.
</p>
<p>
  "It was really interesting and I think it cleared up a lot of things about string theory that we're learning now in our physics class," observed 16-year old junior Andrea Leone.
</p>
<p>
  "She kind of broke it down and made it much easier to understand," chimed in fellow student Andrea Aguilar, "particularly certain things that other people couldn't really explain to us."
</p>
<p>
  Watsonville High physics teacher Joe Manildi helped coordinate the event and noted that he was extremely pleased with the outcome. "I can't say enough about Lisa Randall--she really brought out the best in my students," Manildi said.

<p>
  To Shirley Ann Jackson, nothing less than the future of the nation is at stake as campuses and the nation grapple with issues of diversity and excellence.
</p>
<p>
  "We must mine the talent pool--globally and nationally," said Jackson, president of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy.
</p>
<p>
  Jackson delivered the keynote address on the first day of the Achieving Excellence Through Diversity symposium, on Thursday and Friday, part of the celebration of the investiture of Denice D. Denton as UCSC's ninth chancellor. Before her talk, UC Santa Cruz Foundation president Anuradha Luther Maitra presented Jackson with the third UC Santa Cruz Foundation Medal, recognizing individuals whose achievements illustrate the ideals and vision of UCSC.
</p>
<p>
  A physicist who headed the Nuclear Regulatory Commission from 1995-1999, Jackson said the lack of diversity in science and engineering is especially critical. The United States is seeing a slowdown in its skilled labor force just as other nations are increasing their investment in education, she observed. "These trends threaten our global leadership and our national security."
</p>
<p>
  "I speak frequently about innovation and discovery," Jackson said. "Innovation to meet challenges is enhanced by diversity." History is full of examples of converging cultures bringing about discoveries and advances that benefit mankind, she said.
</p>
<p>
  Jackson served on the National Academy of Sciences committee that recently issued a report on American competitiveness in a changing global environment, <a href="http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11463.html">"Rising Above The Gathering Storm: Energizing and Employing America for a Brighter Economic Future."</a> She also serves on several corporate boards of directors.
</p>
<p>
  Jackson said American corporations have already recognized the benefits of diversity. "Corporations, in large part, do not need convincing. Corporations are embracing diversity because it is essential to maintain their market edge."
</p>
<p>
  Higher education is another story, she said. "It is the universities many times where I find the greatest resistance to change."
</p>
<p>
  Jackson cited successful campus strategies, such as slowing the tenure clock to promote a more family-friendly atmosphere and creating "critical clusters" to attract women and underrepresented minorities.
</p>
<p>
  "The issue of faculty searches is a critical one," she said, adding that she is very involved in faculty searches at Rensselaer University. "This is where so many women and so many minorities never see the light of day."
</p>
<p>
  Jackson urged the campus to move beyond simply adding people from different backgrounds, however. "Just throwing people together does not necessarily inspire innovation," she said, suggesting that a sense of community as well as leadership and excellence were required.
</p>
<p>
  She also encouraged the audience to talk about diversity. "Diversity and discussions of it can be turbulent, messy, and uncomfortable," she said, "but they can also be illuminating."
</p>
<p>
  A panel discussion following the speech reinforced the call for dialogue. Jackson joined the panel, composed of Neferti Tadiar, associate professor of history of consciousness; Manuel Pastor, professor of Latin American and Latino studies; and Maitra, who is CEO of Floreat Inc. as well as president of the UC Santa Cruz Foundation.
</p>
<p>
  Talking about diversity can be hard, Pastor said, but "that is the only way we'll come to the real common ground in the future."
</p>
<p>
  Fielding questions from the audience, panelists were encouraged to continue the dialogue, especially by participating in a series of diversity forums beginning today. (See <a href="http://currents.ucsc.edu/05-06/11-07/brief-diversity.asp"><em>Currents</em> story</a>)
</p>
<p>
  California is on the cutting edge of rapid demographic change--it became a "majority minority" state in 1999--but "California is also at the cutting-edge of inequality," Pastor said. "The University of California has a big role in addressing these inequalities by opening up the system," he added.
</p>
<p>
  Tadiar noted that while in some ways the world seems smaller than ever, "devastating gulfs" between continents and even neighborhoods persist.
</p>
<p>
  Panelists also offered their own takes on the symposium theme of "Excellence Through Diversity."
</p>
<p>
  "I always think about diversity <i>through</i> excellence," said Pastor.
</p>
<p>
  The key question is not excellence through diversity, said Maitra, but "how do we get to diversity through excellence?"
</p>
<p>
  The questions and ideas kept coming on the second day of the symposium, as students, staff, and faculty gathered at the University Center for breakout sessions on three topics related to diversity.
</p>
<p>
  In opening remarks, Angela Davis shared some ambivalence over the viewing of Rosa Parks's casket being viewed in the U.S. Capitol Building. Davis, who grew up in Alabama not far from the civil rights icon, said some Americans see the Rosa Parks story as a symbol that racial divides are a thing of the past. "Her story is one of discrimination overcome, of wrongs righted, of democracy triumphant," Davis said, but the struggle continues.
</p>
<p>
  UCSC alumnus and actress Adilah Barnes, who portrays Angela Davis as part of a one-woman show, recalled that she was bused across town to a mostly white school as a child in California. "The byproduct of diversity in that situation was acceptance. It was not my skin color that mattered most, but my character."
</p>
<p>
  "Diversity is something I've fought for, and been a recipient of, all my life," she said. "I urge you all to keep the dialogue going after this week and to become agents of change on this campus."
</p>
<p>
  Chancellor Denice D. Denton also urged the audience not to shy away from talking about diversity. "We don't learn without engaging in difficult, challenging, discussions," she said.
</p>
<p>
  The gathering then split into three groups. The first, "What is Diversity? Thinking at the Edge," was led by Student Union Assembly Officer Takita Salisberry; astronomy graduate student Kirsten Howley; and Andrea Monroe of the Equal Employment Oportunity/Affirmative Action Office. Summarizing the discussion later to the entire group, Salisberry said they discussed what diversity means, including such categories as age, race, and class, and put the greatest emphasis on race and ethnicity. The group also encouraged a wider conversation over issues of diversity.
</p>
<p>
  The second session, "Teaching to a Diverse Student Body," looked at what goes on in the classroom, from sharing knowledge to helping students feel comfortable to participate. Activities outside the classroom were also supported, as part of a way to encourage students not to become too focused on their own areas of study. Such structural issues as financial aid and ethnic studies were explored, and opportunities for student involvement in the diversity dialogue were endorsed.
</p>
<p>
  The third session, "Update on the UC Faculty Diversity Study," was led by UC President Robert C. Dynes and Lisa Sloan, vice provost and dean of graduate studies. It offered an early look at some of the figures on faculty diversity that are part of the UC President's Task Force on Faculty Diversity. (See <a href="http://currents.ucsc.edu/05-06/11-07/update.asp"><em>Currents</em> story</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Summing up, symposium chair William Ladusaw encouraged students, staff, faculty, and administrators to continue to discuss the issues raised at the symposium. "It needs to become the normal operating process. We need to grow routinely comfortable with the discomfort."

        <title>Grad student honored for work on trace metal contaminants in San Francisco Bay</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 07 Nov 2005 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>7641</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_7640" align="alignright" width="160"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/11/luengen_allison.05-11-07.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7640" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/11/luengen_allison.05-11-07.jpg" alt="Since coming to UCSC in 1998, Allison Luengen has been studying trace metal contaminants in San Francisco Bay.

<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  Allison Luengen grew up peering under docks at the many strange and wonderful creatures that inhabit Puget Sound.
</p>
<p>
  The daughter of a marina manager, Luengen loved the underwater world, but she also understood why people sometimes resisted environmental regulations intended to protect that world. Her father often felt the regulations that affected him were not backed by sufficient science, she said.
</p>
<p>
  "He would say, 'If I knew for sure it mattered, I wouldn't mind making the changes,'" she said.
</p>
<p>
  Now, as a graduate student in environmental toxicology, Luengen is doing just the kind of science that is needed to back up environmental policy. Since coming to UCSC in 1998, she has been studying trace metal contaminants in San Francisco Bay. Earlier this year, she received the Outstanding Student Achievement Award from the Department of ocean sciences.
</p>
<p>
  The award recognizes scientific excellence coupled with outstanding community service. In announcing the award, ocean sciences chair Kenneth Bruland noted Luengen's "impeccable academic credentials," commitment to addressing environmental problems, and public service.
</p>
<p>
  "She epitomizes the aims of the Ocean Sciences award," Bruland said.
</p>
<p>
  Working with Russell Flegal, professor of environmental toxicology, Luengen earned a master's degree in marine sciences in 2001 and is now completing her doctoral thesis in environmental toxicology. For her master's thesis, she developed a technique to quantify immune response in mussels and showed that environmental contaminants change that response. Now she is studying how algal blooms in South San Francisco Bay affect the cycling of trace metals such as copper, mercury, and lead.
</p>
<p>
  Trace metal contamination in San Francisco Bay is a serious environmental and health concern. The bay's water and sediments contain elevated levels of several toxic metals, some of which pose threats to humans and wildlife. State health officials have issued advisories warning people not to eat fish from San Francisco Bay because of mercury contamination.
</p>
<p>
  Sources of metal contaminants to the bay include discharge from industry, storm water runoff, and remobilization from sediments. Much of the mercury in the bay is a legacy of historic mining operations in the mountains of California.
</p>
<p>
  Luengen learned about the complexities of environmental contamination in the bay when she worked as a research associate at the San Francisco Estuary Institute. Realizing that research in this area spans a wide range of disciplines, she came to UCSC determined to broaden her range of scientific skills. Her current work incorporates oceanography, geochemistry, and plankton physiology, and she draws on the expertise of scientists in several departments at UCSC, including Bruland and Peter Raimondi, professor and chair of ecology and evolutionary biology.
</p>
<p>
  The story of pollutants in the bay is much more complex than just figuring out how long it takes for contaminated water to flush out of the bay, Luengen said. Blooms of microscopic algae called phytoplankton--and the way these tiny plants use trace metals in their cells--may affect how long toxic metals like lead and mercury stay in the estuary.
</p>
<p>
  Phytoplankton interact with different metals in different ways. Some metals are necessary for algal growth and are readily incorporated into phytoplankton cells or stuck to the outside of the cell surfaces. If the metals are bound to other compounds, they may be unavailable to algal cells. Mercury is not necessary for cell growth, but in the form of methyl mercury it easily slips through cell membranes. Metals that become incorporated in algal cells enter the food chain, where they can build up in fish and shellfish that feed on the algae.
</p>
<p>
  "There is the potential for metals to go into the algae, then through shellfish to fish and on to people," Luengen said.
</p>
<p>
  Luengen's work is part of a larger goal to learn what causes high levels of mercury in fish and whether or not there is anything that can be done to lower these levels, Flegal explained.
</p>
<p>
  Luengen has chosen to study San Francisco Bay because it is a place where humans interact extensively with the marine environment. Not only are estuaries heavily impacted by human activities, an unhealthy estuary affects all the people who live on its shores.
</p>
<p>
  "Estuaries are incredibly fun to study because they're a dynamic interface between land and sea," Luengen said.
</p>
<p>
  Luengen has repeatedly demonstrated her commitment to the community and to promoting the health of San Francisco Bay. At the San Francisco Estuary Institute, scientists were so impressed with her work that she has a standing offer of employment, Flegal said.
</p>
<p>
  But her commitment to public service extends beyond her concerns about San Francisco Bay. Luengen serves as the internal vice president of UCSC's Graduate Student Association. She also teaches an environmental toxicology class for the California State Summer School for Mathematics and Science in which she helps high school students measure contaminants in a local lagoon. She says she enjoys the change of pace and watching the students get excited about marine science. The program, known as COSMOS, brings motivated high school students together with successful scientists to explore their interest in a wide range of scientific topics.
</p>
<p>
  Luengen's scientific achievements and commitment to public service have been widely recognized. She has received prestigious fellowships and earned awards for her presentations at scientific meetings.
</p>
<p>
  "We fully expect Allison to become a leader in the environmental field in the San Francisco Bay Area," Bruland said.

<p>
  In a ceremony that cast aside pomp and circumstance in favor of multiculturalism, Denice D. Denton was formally invested as the ninth chancellor of UC Santa Cruz on Friday, capping a two-day symposium on excellence and diversity.
</p>
<p>
  "UC Santa Cruz does things differently but for a purpose," said Denton, whose choice of a nontraditional inauguration was in keeping with the campus's reputation for innovation.
</p>
<p>
  As he prepared to present Denton with the Chancellor's Medal, UC President Robert Dynes acknowledged the milestone--and the campus's recent change of status within the UC system.
</p>
<p>
  "On Labor Day this year, Santa Cruz ended its 40-year stint as the young kid on the block," said Dynes. The campus, with its unsurpassed physical beauty, highly regarded programs, and commitment to public service, "exemplifies why the UC system is the premier university system in the world," he added.
</p>
<p>
  Describing Denton as forthright, honest, direct, and a "trailblazer in pursuit of equity and multiculturalism," Dynes said she has the "capability to raise this campus to the next level. It will be my pleasure to watch her, help her, advise her, and cheer."
</p>
<p>
  Denton received a standing ovation from the near-capacity crowd in the Music Center Recital Hall as she took the podium. Sprinkling her remarks with Japanese, Arabic, Spanish, and Swahili, Denton pledged her commitment to the campus and hailed UCSC's leadership in interdisciplinary research. She praised her predecessors, as well as the students, staff, faculty, and administrators "on whose achievements we build."
</p>
<p>
  Denton challenged the campus to "lead at the edge" and outlined six priorities that will guide decisions and the distribution of resources.<br>

        <title>Living with the Changing California Coast: Essential reading for coast dwellers from UCSC geologists</title>

<p>
  The famously beautiful California coast is a powerful attractor, drawing people to live and build in the coastal zone despite ongoing erosion, periodic storm damage, and regulatory hurdles. For those determined to live next to this dynamic shoreline, the new book <i>Living with the Changing California Coast</i> should be required reading.
</p>
<p>
  Written by Gary Griggs, Kiki Patsch, and Lauret Savoy, with contributions from more than a dozen other coastal experts, the book was released in November from the University of California Press. It is a completely revised and updated edition of the 1985 book <i>Living with the California Coast,</i> by Griggs and Savoy. Griggs is a professor of Earth sciences and director of the Institute of Marine Sciences. Patsch and Savoy both worked with Griggs as graduate students, and Patsch is now a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Virginia, while Savoy is a professor of geology and environmental studies at Mount Holyoke College.
</p>
<p>
  The first part of the book provides a wealth of background information on coastal processes and hazards, with advice for home buyers, residents, coastal managers, and developers. There are sections on climate change, rising sea levels, coastal erosion, responding to coastal hazards, and coastal policy and legislation. The second part of the book consists of 12 chapters, each providing a comprehensive discussion of one geographic section of the coast.
</p>
<p>
  "There has been a lot of investment on the coast, both public and private, so we need to heighten people's awareness of these issues," Griggs said.
</p>
<p>
  Much has changed in the 20 years since the first edition appeared. People have continued to move to the coast, property values have skyrocketed, and the coast has been battered by stronger and more frequent storms. Starting with the El Nino event of 1978, the coastal climate shifted from a more moderate phase of its cycle to a period dominated by major El Nino events that bring powerful and destructive storms to the California coast.
</p>
<p>
  "We entered this period of big El Nino events, with stronger storms, more cliff retreat, more beach erosion, and more seawall proposals. The combination of more people, more hazards, and higher property values has focused a lot of attention on this narrow strip of shoreline that is constantly changing," Griggs said.
</p>
<p>
  The book includes nearly 300 photographs and 81 detailed maps covering the entire coast. Patsch prepared the maps using geographic information system (GIS) technology to provide precise information on geologic hazards along all 1,100 miles of the California coastline. The maps include hazard ratings, erosion rates where available, descriptions of coastal landforms, locations of seawalls and other types of armoring, and other useful and interesting information about every stretch of shoreline.
</p>
<p>
  The photographs include dramatic illustrations of damage to coastal structures, as well as extensive documentation of natural and man-made features along the coast. Many of the photos were provided by the <a href="http://www.Californiacoastline.org">California Coastal Records Project</a>, which includes photographs of the entire coastline on its web site.
</p>
<p>
  "We have much better photo coverage of the coast in this edition, and the GIS-based maps are more accurate and easier to read," Griggs said.
</p>
<p>
  <i>Living with the Changing California Coast</i> is an essential resource for those intending to buy or build along the coast, for planners in coastal cities and counties, and for anyone who needs or wants specific information about California's various coastal regions. Aside from its practical value, the book provides a fascinating look at one of the most beautiful coastlines in the world, with information on its natural history, the forces that have shaped it, and how it continues to evolve over time.
</p>
<p>
  "I think it should appeal to anybody who is interested in the coast and curious about the way the coastline operates, how it changes, and what are the issues we face in dealing with coastal hazards," Griggs said.
</p>
<p>
  Griggs will give a presentation on his new book at a special event at the <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/seymourcenter/">Seymour Marine Discovery Center</a> on Thursday, November 17, at 6 p.m. There will be a wine and cheese reception after the reading; admission is $10 for the general public, $6 for members. Griggs will also discuss the book at Bookshop Santa Cruz on Thursday, November 10, at 7:30 p.m.

  The dinner, held in the College Nine and College Ten Multipurpose Room, was the final event in three days of special campus activities surrounding the investiture of Chancellor Denice D. Denton.
</p>
<p>
  In her welcoming remarks, Denton announced the successful conclusion of the UCSC Cornerstone Campaign, which raised more that $67 million, nearly $18 million over its goal. The two-year campaign benefited every area of UCSC, with a special emphasis on undergraduate and graduate student support.
</p>
<p>
  "I want to especially thank the generous donors, our hard-working faculty, deans, and staff, and Gordon Ringold, UCSC alumnus, Foundation Trustee, and chair of the Cornerstone Campaign Council," said Chancellor Denton. "They were the key to making this campaign a success." The Chancellor also announced that in the year since the last Scholarships Benefit Dinner, $2.7 million has been raised to support undergraduate scholarships and graduate fellowships at UCSC.
</p>
<p>
  Honored at the dinner was longtime campus and community benefactor Jack Baskin, who received a standing ovation as he was presented with the first UCSC "Fiat Lux" award, given in recognition of his distinguished and sustained service in support of the campus's programs and goals.
</p>
<p>
  In his acceptance remarks, Baskin, who has served as a UCSC Foundation trustee since 1978, recalled that his involvement with the campus began when he was the only non-UCSC staff member on the campus physical planning committee. Baskin credited his major campus gift, which established the Jack Baskin School of Engineering, to his wife, Peggy Downes Baskin. "She encouraged me to 'do something dear to my heart,'" said Baskin, who was an aeronautical engineer prior to his career in housing construction.
</p>
<p>
  In a surprise announcement, Chancellor Denton revealed that Baskin's family, friends, and UCSC colleagues have created the Jack Baskin Engineering Scholarship in his honor. The new fund, which will support engineering students at UCSC, honors Baskin's educational leadership and vision for young engineers. Baskin also received honorary proclamations from the U.S. Senate, the California State Assembly, and the City of Santa Cruz.
</p>
<p>
  Dinner co-hosts Anuradha Luther Maitra, president of the UCSC Foundation, and Dom Siababa, president of the UCSC Alumni Council, spoke on the transformative impact of student support. Their remarks were highlighted by two additional speakers, recent alumnus Tremain Jones and professor of psychology and chair of the UCSC Academic Senate Faye Crosby.
</p>
<p>
  A 2005 graduate of UCSC's Kresge College, Jones is the initial recipient of the UCSC Alumni Association's "First-in-Family" Scholarship. He described the challenges of growing up in East Palo Alto and working two jobs to support himself as he studied full-time at a community college. The financial support he received at UCSC helped him complete a B.A. in anthropology. "Now, a kid from East Palo Alto will be going to Borneo," said Jones, who will travel there next winter to study orangutans in their natural environment.
</p>
<p>
  In describing the contributions of the diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students who work in her research lab, Crosby focused on the story of a recent alumna who immigrated from El Salvador as a teenager speaking no English and went on to complete a UCSC degree in four years and enter law school. "She asked me challenging questions about the relevancy of my research," said Crosby, whose work focuses on affirmative action and diversity issues in education and business.
</p>
<p>
  "The faculty thank you very much for being involved," Crosby told the audience. "Your involvement is what keeps this enterprise going."

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  B. Ruby Rich, assistant professor of community studies, attended the Toronto International Film Festival in September. In October, she held a conversation with Palestinian filmmaker Hany Abu-Assad on stage at the Clay Theatre in San Francisco. His film, <i>Paradise Now</i>, seeks to increase understanding of the mindsets of Palestinian suicide bombers. It is being released by Warners Independent, which Rich said shows a "new mainstreaming of this kind of material."

  In her welcoming remarks, Denton announced the successful conclusion of the UCSC Cornerstone Campaign, which raised more than $67 million, nearly $18 million over its goal. The two-year campaign benefited every area of UCSC, with a special emphasis on undergraduate and graduate student support.
</p>
<p>
  "I want to especially thank the generous donors, our hard-working faculty, deans, and staff, and Gordon Ringold, UCSC alumnus, Foundation Trustee, and chair of the Cornerstone Campaign Council," said Chancellor Denton. "They were the key to making this campaign a success."
</p>
<p>
  The chancellor also announced that in the year since the last Scholarships Benefit Dinner, $2.7 million has been raised to support undergraduate scholarships and graduate fellowships at UCSC.
</p>
<p>
  Honored at the dinner was longtime campus and community benefactor Jack Baskin, who received a standing ovation as he was presented with the first UCSC Fiat Lux Award, given in recognition of his distinguished and sustained service in support of the campus's programs and goals.
</p>
<p>
  In his acceptance remarks, Baskin, who has served as a UCSC Foundation trustee since 1978, recalled that his involvement with the campus began when he was the only non-UCSC staff member on the campus physical planning committee. Baskin credited his major campus gift, which established the Jack Baskin School of Engineering, to his wife, Peggy Downes Baskin. "She encouraged me to 'do something dear to my heart,'" said Baskin, who was an aeronautical engineer prior to his career in housing construction.
</p>
<p>
  In a surprise announcement, Chancellor Denton revealed that Baskin's family, friends, and UCSC colleagues have created the Jack Baskin Engineering Scholarship in his honor. The new fund, which will support engineering students at UCSC, honors Baskin's educational leadership and vision for young engineers. Baskin also received honorary proclamations from the U.S. Senate, the California State Assembly, and the City of Santa Cruz.
</p>
<p>
  Dinner cohosts Anuradha Luther Maitra, president of the UCSC Foundation, and Dom Siababa, president of the UCSC Alumni Council, spoke on the transformative impact of student support. Their remarks were highlighted by two additional speakers: recent alumnus Tremain Jones and professor of psychology and chair of the UCSC Academic Senate Faye Crosby.
</p>
<p>
  A 2005 graduate of UCSC's Kresge College, Jones is a recipient of a Karl S. Pister Scholarship. He described the challenges of growing up in East Palo Alto and working two jobs to support himself as he studied full-time at a community college. The financial support he received at UCSC helped him complete a B.A. in anthropology. "Now, a kid from East Palo Alto will be going to Borneo," said Jones, who will travel there next winter to study orangutans in their natural environment.
</p>
<p>
  In describing the contributions of the diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students who work in her research lab, Crosby focused on the story of a recent alumna who immigrated from El Salvador as a teenager speaking no English and went on to complete a UCSC degree in four years and enter law school. "She asked me challenging questions about the relevancy of my research," said Crosby, whose work focuses on affirmative action and diversity issues in education and business.
</p>
<p>
  "The faculty thank you very much for being involved," Crosby told the audience. "Your involvement is what keeps this enterprise going."

<p>
  Each fall, faculty affiliated with the Chicano/Latino Research Center invite a small number of undergraduates interested in cross-border studies to join them as "research apprentices." These students participate in significant research projects and benefit from the opportunity of working closely with a faculty mentor and interacting with a cohort of students and faculty with shared interests.
</p>
<p>
  "We created the apprenticeship because we wanted to build an avenue to encourage promising students to pursue graduate studies and professional careers," said CLRC director Aida Hurtado, a professor of psychology. "Mentors can help students access all kinds of resources--financial and otherwise--to pursue their goals."
</p>
<p>
  In order to expand the popular program, which has served 60 undergraduates over the last five years, the CLRC is hosting the First Annual CLRC Frida Kahlo Ball and Awards Ceremony on November 19. All proceeds from the event will go toward the Undergraduate Research Apprenticeship Program (URAP).
</p>
<p>
  The awards ceremony will take place from 7 to 8:30 p.m., followed by dancing until midnight. A donor reception will take place from 6 to 7 p.m. Tickets to the ball cost $50-$100; $20 for students. The donor reception costs $25. All contributions are tax-deductible.
</p>
<p>
  Student "apprentices" rave about URAP. Sarah Amador, who majored in literature and philosophy, participated for two years. She was initially invited to participate by Lourdes Martinez-Echazabal, associate professor of literature. As a senior, she worked with Juan Poblete, also an associate professor of literature.
</p>
<p>
  "I had no idea how much my experience with URAP was going to motivate me to apply to graduate programs in Hispanic literatures," said Amador, who began doctoral studies at New York University this fall.
</p>
<p>
  The apprenticeship "opened my eyes to academic life," said Amador, who found her access to an interdisciplinary community of undergraduates, graduate students, and academics working on cross-border studies invaluable.
</p>
<p>
  Ernesto Maldonado said being a "professor's sidekick" was an amazing experience. Invited to participate by Norma Klahn, professor of literature, Maldonado spent hours in McHenry Library gathering materials about Carlos Monsivais, one of Mexico's leading intellectuals. The process of helping Klahn prepare a scholarly article was fascinating, but learning that Klahn "hangs out" with Monsivais when he's in town "seemed surreal."
</p>
<p>
  "I was blown away and couldn't really believe it until I attended a conference with Norma and went to lunch with a group of well-known intellectuals and a novelist," said Maldonado, a literature major who graduated last spring. "I was amazed by their conversations--they were like family, and not a dysfunctional one!" By the end of the conference, Maldonado no longer felt like an outsider and was thrilled to speak with Mexican director Arturo Ripstein and screenwriter Paz Alicia Garciadiego.
</p>
<p>
  Organizers of the Frida Kahlo Ball hope to raise enough money to expand the apprenticeship program, which is in its final year of funding, said Hurtado.
</p>
<p>
  "Many of us know from our own educational experiences how important mentors can be," said Hurtado. "Now, as professors, it's our turn to provide support and professional guidance."
</p>
<p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  "Hybridity and its Discontents: Considering Visual Culture in Colonial Spanish America" (<i>Colonial Latin American Review</i> vol. 12., no. 1, pp. 5-35, June 2003), coauthored by UCSC professor of history of art and visual culture Carolyn Dean and Smith College associate professor of art history Dana Leibsohn, has been awarded the Franklin Pease G. Y. Memorial Prize for the best article published in <i>Colonial Latin American Review</i> in 2003 and 2004. This same article also received the 2004 Conference prize for the best article on Latin American history from the AHA Conference on Latin American History.
</p>
<p>
  The jury for the 2003-04 <i>Colonial Latin American Review</i> prize consisted of three distinguished scholars of colonial Latin America, all members of CLAR's Advisory Board: Mercedes Lopez-Baralt, Universidad de Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras; Stuart B. Schwartz, Yale University; and Eric Van Young, University of California, San Diego. The article was praised as "well written, thoughtful, wide-ranging, and interesting," with one reader observing that in the essay "a winning combination of erudition and theoretical deconstruction humbles the contemporary scholar into accepting the complexity of a reality that will never completely unveil its mysteries." The Pease Prize will be announced in the upcoming (December 2005) issue of the journal.

<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  UCSC professor of English and comparative literature Murray Baumgarten has been awarded a $195,452 grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities to fund a summer institute for college and university teachers in Italy.
</p>
<p>
  Titled "Venice, the Jews and Italian Culture: Historical Eras and Cultural Representations," the institute is scheduled to take place in Venice from June 19 to July 21, 2006.
</p>
<p>
  The five-week interdisciplinary program will explore the cultural, intellectual, and historical experience of Italian and Venetian Jews through the study of literary, artistic, and dramatic works.
</p>
<p>
  The institute is designed for the professional development of college and university teachers in various fields of study--including European culture, literature, art, history, Holocaust studies, Italian studies, and Jewish studies.
</p>
<p>
  Baumgarten will serve as codirector of the institute along with Shaul Bassi, associate professor of literature at the University of Venice. The program will have its headquarters in the historic Jewish ghetto of Venice and include tours of Renaissance art and architecture, as well as a visit to the only concentration camp established by the Nazis in Italy. Optional instruction in Italian and Hebrew will also be available to participants.
</p>
<p>
  "The University of Venice has been very hospitable to us, and they have offered us space to meet in," Baumgarten noted. "Their dean is also very interested in seeking a cooperative arrangement with UCSC in language studies--they teach 32 languages."
</p>
<p>
  Baumgarten explained why he decided to create a summer institute that would focus on Venice.
</p>
<p>
  "The Jewish community in Venice is an important but neglected piece of Jewish and European history," he said. "Having been expelled from most of Western Europe, Jews settled in Venice in 1516, and though they were sequestered in a ghetto, the Jewish community flourished in business and the arts. Jews were eventually allowed to become traders with the Middle Eastern world and had an integral role in early capitalism. They also built five synagogues in Baroque styles and changed the culture by introducing music and composers into the synagogue."
</p>
<p>
  "Fifteen years after Gutenberg invented movable type, Venetian Jews with the help of Christian companies became involved in publishing books, and one-third of all Jewish books in the 16th century were published in Venice," Baumgarten added. "So the Jews of Venice became an important source of Jewish culture all over the world."
</p>
<p>
  Baumgarten noted that one aspect of the project is to put together a Venetian Jewish anthology that includes significant documents, commentaries by scholars, and pieces by a variety of renowned Jewish authors. "Many famous writers visited Venice and wrote about it," said Baumgarten. "We will collect those documents and excerpt them--that will be a source for the teachers to use when they go back to the classroom."
</p>
<p>
  NEH grants for summer institutes and seminars are awarded annually to offer teachers the opportunity to gain a deeper knowledge of current scholarship in the humanities. Baumgarten's project is one of 20 summer institutes funded nationwide this year through competitive grants totaling more than $3 million. Overall, the NEH awarded almost $20 million to fund 124 projects for 2006.
</p>
<p>
  "The humanities convey the story of civilization, and NEH grant recipients tell that story," said NEH chairman Bruce Cole. "NEH supports projects that are rigorous, wide-ranging, and substantial in their examination and illumination of the great events and great ideas of the past."
</p>
<p>
  Twenty-four teachers will be selected from around the country to participate in the Venice institute, and each will receive a stipend of $3,600. <a href="http://humwww.ucsc.edu/jewishstudies/nehvenice.html">More information</a> is available online, or by contacting UCSC's Jewish Studies Program at (831) 459-1225.

        <title>Staff advisers' role on Regents 'historic,' says head of statewide staff group</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 31 Oct 2005 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>7599</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_7598" align="alignright" width="200"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/10/anderson_rosemary.05-10-31.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7598" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/10/anderson_rosemary.05-10-31.jpg" alt="Rosemary Anderson chairs the statewide Council of University of California Staff Assemblies.

<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  UC staff now has a seat at the table with the Board of Regents--and UCSC's Rosemary Anderson has the perfect vantage point.
</p>
<p>
  This summer marked the beginning of a two-year pilot program in which two staff or non-Senate academic employees are serving as nonvoting advisers to two Regents committees: the Committee on Educational Policy and the Committee on Grounds and Buildings.
</p>
<p>
  Each staff adviser is also invited to stay and observe all open sessions of the Regents' meetings and certain other Regents' events.
</p>
<p>
  "It's history in the making," said Rosemary Anderson, chair of the statewide Council of University of California Staff Assemblies (CUCSA), which wrote the proposal to the Regents for the staff advisers position. The council is made up of staff, including the UCSC <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/sab/">Staff Advisory Board</a>, from every UC location throughout the system including UCOP and the three National Labs. The <a href="http://www.ucop.edu/cucsa/">staff advisers to the Regents</a> for 2005-06 are David Bell of UC San Francisco (educational policy) and Dave Miller of UCLA (grounds and buildings).
</p>
<p>
  "I think the Regents are going to be pleasantly surprised and the staff perspective is going to be especially helpful," predicted Anderson. "We're a driving force for delivering services to students." Anderson, executive assistant to associate vice chancellor of Colleges and University Housing Services Jean Marie Scott, attends each Regents meeting in her role as CUCSA chair.
</p>
<p>
  While the staff advisers--like faculty representatives and student Regents--do not have a vote, the advisers "have made a huge difference in staff's visibility and credibility," said Anderson. She said access to the Regents is the key, and that a considerable amount of discussion goes on outside the meetings.
</p>
<p>
  Anderson said the addition of staff advisers is part of a shift in the way staff members are viewed in the UC system under UC President Dynes. "There is more of a collegial feeling across the system," she said, pointing out that the UC Human Resources Office has sought input from CUCSA for the past few years.
</p>
<p>
  Anderson also praised the level of staff-faculty cooperation that led to the staff advisers. Then-faculty representative to the Regents George Blumenthal, UCSC professor of astronomy and astrophysics, was "a critical liaison" in the effort, she said.
</p>
<p>
  The staff council is required by the Higher Education Employer-Employee Relations Act to steer clear of anything approaching salary negotiations, but members can raise issues of morale and tell the Regents how staff members' flagging pay affects retention--a major problem systemwide with baby boomers starting to retire. "We're going to be in trouble if we don't address that," Anderson said.
</p>
<p>
  One idea being resurrected is university fee waivers or fee discounts for employees' children. "It's a gesture to acknowledge the value of the people working for the University of California," said Anderson.
</p>
<p>
  While staff council members are excited about the adviser pilot program, they are hoping to fine-tune the selection process for the next set of advisers.
</p>
<p>
  "We didn't want it to be about us," Anderson said of the current selection of advisers by CUCSA. On the other hand, the council did not want to let the opportunity for representation to slip by after so many years of trying. "We really felt an initial success was critical."
</p>
<p>
  Anderson said the staff council would prefer to have advisers chosen more like the way student Regents are selected: each campus offers one candidate, selection committees winnow down the candidates, and a committee of the Board of Regents makes the final choice.
</p>
<p>
  Anderson, who has been on UCSC's Staff Advisory Board since 2001 and on the systemwide staff council since 2002, hopes the new visibility for staff will encourage more staff members to become involved.
</p>
<p>
  UCSC staff members will get a chance to see what the staff council is all about when the Staff Advisory Board hosts the organization's quarterly meeting December 7-9 at various campus locations (check the <a href="http://sab.ucsc.edu/">SAB web site</a> for specifics).
</p>
<p>
  Chancellor Denice D. Denton will join the group December 8, and a special staff recognition award will be presented afterward.

<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  When global justice activists took to the streets in the late 1990s to demand reforms such as higher wages and better working conditions for laborers around the world, corporate strategists saw the writing on the wall: Adopt voluntary codes of conduct or face increased government regulation. They opted for self-regulation.
</p>
<p>
  That response, and similarities to the corporate reaction two decades earlier to calls for corporate accountability, is critiqued by UCSC doctoral candidate James K. Rowe in a chapter of the new book <i>Globalization, Governmentality and Global Politics: Regulation for the Rest of Us?</i> (London: Routledge, 2005) by UCSC politics professor Ronnie Lipschutz.
</p>
<p>
  The book examines social and environmental regulation in an era of globalization; Rowe's is the only chapter not written by Lipschutz.
</p>
<p>
  Rowe's contribution, entitled "Corporate Social Responsibility as Business Strategy," analyzes the corporate response to the global justice movement, from intent to impact, over a 40-year span.
</p>
<p>
  "Corporate social responsibility isn't about business ethics," said Rowe. "It's a business strategy meant to forestall popular power that might result in effective regulation. If corporations were serious about social responsibility, why do they oppose having responsibilities formalized in law by regulation?"
</p>
<p>
  Rowe calls the global justice movement the "second wave" of public outcry over corporate malfeasance. The first wave took place in the 1960s and 1970s, when revelations about corporate corruption, tax evasion, and involvement in clandestine political activities, including the U.S.-backed coup that ousted Chilean president Salvador Allende, fueled populist attempts to rein in corporate power and increase accountability. In 1976, the United Nations began negotiating a binding international code of conduct for corporations.
</p>
<p>
  Despite that wave of public pressure, deregulation accelerated under the administration of President Ronald Reagan, and corporate profits soared as global markets opened up in the 1990s under free-trade agreements negotiated by President Bill Clinton. Negotiations on the UN code stalled permanently in 1981, after it had been made voluntary instead of binding.
</p>
<p>
  Driven by their legally binding quest to generate profits, corporations fanned out around the globe in search of cheap labor and lax environmental standards, according to Rowe. The accompanying "race to the bottom" of social, environmental, and human rights protections has contributed to "morbidly low wages, deforestation, and climate change," he said.
</p>
<p>
  History shows that in the absence of strong government regulation, corporate responses to populist movements have minimal impact, said Rowe.
</p>
<p>
  "If voluntary efforts worked, there would have been no second wave," said Rowe. "Empirical studies of corporate codes of conduct show that they fall short."
</p>
<p>
  As revelations of sweatshop conditions swept the garment-manufacturing industry in the early 1990s, consumers expressed displeasure, and business promised to do better. In one high-profile case, Kathie Lee Gifford tearfully vowed to make amends after media reports revealed that child labor was used in the production of garments sold under Gifford's label.
</p>
<p>
  Only government regulations can force corporations to internalize costs that are currently passed on to society, said Rowe, pointing out that low wages force workers to rely on the state for help with housing and other basic needs. Similarly, the absence of strict environmental regulations ensures that the costs of corporate pollution get passed on to taxpayers, who end up footing the bill for cleanup and restoration.
</p>
<p>
  At the turn of the millennium, activists and organizations such as Amnesty International, Friends of the Earth, and the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions were willing to work with corporations to develop voluntary codes of conduct hoping they would improve wages, working conditions, and environmental degradation.
</p>
<p>
  Just as the global justice movement was poised to make great strides, the September 11 terrorist attacks shifted attention and resources away from concerns about corporate behavior, said Rowe. Recently, however, as the movement regains momentum, he has detected signs that organizers have learned from history and are changing strategy.
</p>
<p>
  "The consensus now is that voluntary corporate social responsibility isn't working," he said. "I think organizers are ready to bring government back into the marketplace to protect workers and the environment. If they want protections, they have to push for binding regulations. You can't rely on the market to cure the market's ills."

        <title>Organic rose care demystified in new book by UCSC Garden Manager Orin Martin</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 31 Oct 2005 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>7594</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_7593" align="alignright" width="200"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/10/rose_primer.200.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7593" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/10/rose_primer.200.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="193" /></a>[/caption]
<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  Master gardener Orin Martin cuts a lush bouquet of fresh, organically grown garden roses for his eldest daughter each year on her birthday. What's unusual is that she was born November 9. Better yet, when Martin sits down to Thanksgiving dinner, a rose-based bouquet often adorns his table.
</p>
<p>
  Impossible, you say? Not so, replies Martin, manager of UCSC's celebrated Alan Chadwick Garden. "Roses require a little bit of attention every day, and for that, they'll reward you with a spectacular bloom in April, a mini-spring in August and September, and blossoms into November and December, depending on the weather," said Martin.
</p>
<p>
  After years of perfecting the art of organic rose care, Martin shares his expertise with the rest of us in the new book, <i>A Rose Primer: An Organic Approach to Rose Selection and Care</i> (Santa Cruz, CA: Friends of the UCSC Farm & Garden and the Center for Agroecology & Sustainable Food Systems).
</p>
<p>
  The book spells out the steps to success in a year-round guide to the care and feeding of organically grown roses, and includes Martin's tips regarding selection, sources, and planting, as well. Each section ends with a handy "In a Nutshell" summary for busy gardeners. Though focused on rose-growing on the Central Coast, the book is filled with principles that carry over to rose cultivation in other areas.
</p>
<p>
  "People think of roses as requiring lots of chemicals, but really what they need is care. If you have five minutes a day, you can do it," said Martin. "Roses are resilient. With good care, you can turn them around in a matter of weeks during the growing season."
</p>
<p>
  Success lies in a program of pruning, fertility, and disease control, according to Martin.
</p>
<p>
  * <b>Pruning</b>--Winter pruning is performed during January's brief period of dormancy to stimulate growth. Counterintuitively, the more you prune, the more growth you'll get. Heavy pruning is followed by "fingerpruning" in February and March to control new growth and shape the plant.
</p>
<p>
  * <b>Fertility</b>--Winter pruning should be followed with a liberal two-inch layer of organic compost, topped by an inch of mulch to control weeds and hold moisture.
</p>
<p>
  * <b>Disease control</b>--Following the winter pruning, a light spray of dormant petroleum oil will combat insects and lime sulfur will reduce fungus. Using both produces a synergistic effect and requires one-third less product, noted Martin. "If you do nothing else with your roses, prune them hard in the winter and use these sprays in tandem," said Martin.
</p>
<p>
  Other rose necessities include good drainage, regular water, and tidy surroundings. "Remove spent blooms and any diseased foliage promptly, and keep the soil at the base of your roses free of leaves, which are disease vectors," urged Martin. After the first bloom, apply more compost and a granular organic fertilizer, followed by a deep watering, and you'll be rewarded in a matter of weeks. "Roses are cyclical, with a four- to eight-week hiatus between blooms," said Martin. "When you cut a spent flower, it prompts the plant to create a new bud. As my grandmother always said, with roses, you've got to take to get."

<p>
  As a UCSC undergraduate in the 1970s, Bruce Stein and a group of fellow students spent an entire spring quarter in the Eastern Mojave Desert doing surveys of the Granite Mountains, learning all they could about the area's natural resources, and eventually publishing their findings in a report that influenced the Bureau of Land Management's planning decisions for the area.
</p>
<p>
  Although Stein spends less time in the field these days, his interests remain much the same--providing the scientific information needed to guide conservation and land management decisions.
</p>
<p>
  As vice president for programs at NatureServe, a nonprofit conservation organization, Stein oversees the collection, analysis, and dissemination of information from a vast network of biological inventory programs. Through its searchable online databases and other products, NatureServe provides reliable data on rare and endangered species and ecosystems for land managers, policy makers, and the general public.
</p>
<p>
  "We focus on bringing good science into the conservation process," Stein said. "As the scientific experts, we can work with environmental organizations as well as with government agencies and development interests to make sure their actions are grounded in good science."
</p>
<p>
  The <a href="http://www.natureserve.org/">NatureServe Explorer web site</a> provides access to scientific information on more than 65,000 plants, animals, and ecosystems in the United States and Canada, while a related site (InfoNatura) offers data from Latin America.
</p>
<p>
  Stein not only helps manage all of this information, he is also an avid user of it. "One of the things I enjoy most is analyzing our data from a big-picture perspective and writing about what the data are telling us," he said.
</p>
<p>
  He is the author of the book <i>Precious Heritage: The Status of Biodiversity in the United States</i> (Oxford University Press, 2000), described by Harvard University biologist E. O. Wilson as "the definitive text on U.S. biodiversity."
</p>
<p>
  "That was a major effort to pull together the information we had and ask what do we really know about biodiversity in the U.S., and what should we be doing to preserve it," said Stein, who worked on the project with about 20 collaborators from the Nature Conservancy, the National Park Service, and other organizations.
</p>
<p>
  More recently, Stein coauthored the 2005 report <i>Endangered by Sprawl: How Runaway Development Threatens America's Wildlife,</i> a joint project of NatureServe, the National Wildlife Federation, and Smart Growth America.
</p>
<p>
  At UCSC, Stein majored in biology and environmental studies. The Granite Mountains project got its start when he took the <i>Natural History Field Quarter</i> course taught by the late Kenneth Norris, a professor of natural history.
</p>
<p>
  "He was a fabulous teacher and mentor--one of those truly inspiring individuals. You're lucky if you meet one such person in your lifetime," Stein said.
</p>
<p>
  Ten students in the class applied for and won a $20,000 grant from the National Science Foundation to conduct a resource inventory of the Granite Mountains, with Stein as project director and principal investigator on the grant.
</p>
<p>
  "I think it was a pivotal experience for a lot of us who went through that," he said. "It's the kind of thing UCSC is known for--the idea that you can give a big responsibility to undergraduates and they will rise to the challenge."
</p>
<p>
  During the project, Stein became increasingly interested in botany. He got to know Robert Thorne of the Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden, who generously shared his knowledge and expertise with the students. Thorne, a world-renowned botanist and a leading authority on the evolution of flowering plants, inspired Stein to continue studying botany. But Stein says it wasn't until he was in graduate school that he realized just how important a figure in botany Thorne was.
</p>
<p>
  After graduating from UCSC in 1978, Stein spent a year traveling in South America, where he "got smitten by the tropical bug." Deciding to pursue a Ph.D. in tropical botany, he wrote a letter introducing himself to the eminent botanist Peter Raven, director of the Missouri Botanical Garden and a leading advocate for the study and conservation of tropical forests.
</p>
<p>
  "One of the things I learned at UCSC was to be bold," Stein said.
</p>
<p>
  With Raven as his adviser, Stein earned his Ph.D. from Washington University in St. Louis, studying the tropical relatives of lobelias for his thesis. After graduate school, he took a position as a Latin American botanist with the Nature Conservancy. Within six months, he had become director of the Conservancy's Latin America Science Program.
</p>
<p>
  Stein worked at the Nature Conservancy for more than a decade, advising the organization on conservation priorities and establishing biological inventory programs throughout the Western Hemisphere.
</p>
<p>
  NatureServe, originally known as the Association for Biodiversity Information, was established in 1999 as an offshoot of the Nature Conservancy, created to carry on the organization's biological inventory and assessment work. Stein moved into his current position as vice president for programs in 2000.
</p>
<p>
  <i>Precious Heritage,</i> published that year, had an immediate impact. A <i>New York Times</i> editorial exhorted the nation to protect the rich natural heritage documented in the book. The book included an analysis of biodiversity "hotspots" and a map showing areas with particularly high concentrations of imperiled species. That hotspot map continues to influence conservation efforts, in some cases leading directly to major investments from philanthropic groups to protect land in hotspots of biodiversity.
</p>
<p>
  Meanwhile, Stein continues to work on new ways of using NatureServe's data. He is currently working with the Environmental Protection Agency to develop methods for assessing the health of freshwater ecosystems.
</p>
<p>
  From the California desert, to the tropical forests of Latin America, to the NatureServe headquarters in Washington, D.C., Stein has steadfastly pursued his interests in biology and conservation.
</p>
<p>
  "At Santa Cruz, I was allowed to focus on the things that truly interested me. I just followed my passion and was able to create a career out of it," he said.<br>

<p>
  California's iconic oak woodlands have endured many assaults over the years--they've been cut for fuel, cleared for vineyards and housing developments, and their seedlings face intense grazing pressure and competition from invasive grasses.
</p>
<p>
  But the future will bring a new threat--climate change--which could drastically reduce the areas in which oaks can grow.
</p>
<p>
  UCSC researchers have taken a close look at the implications of climate change for two familiar California oak species--blue oak and valley oak. Their findings will be published online this week in the <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences</i> and will appear in the November 8 issue of the journal.
</p>
<p>
  The researchers found that the areas of the state where the climate is suitable for these species to grow will shift northward and could shrink to nearly half their current size as a result of global warming.
</p>
<p>
  "Species such as oaks that we think of as occurring throughout California and that are such a recognizable part of the landscape are vulnerable to climate change. It's not just the rare and endangered species that will be affected," said Lara Kueppers, a postdoctoral researcher at UCSC and first author of the study.
</p>
<p>
  The researchers used sophisticated climate models to project what California's climate may be like in the final decade of the 21st century, assuming a "business-as-usual" scenario for ongoing emissions of greenhouse gases. Based on those projections, they predicted the potential ranges for blue oak and valley oak under the new climatic conditions, and compared that with their ranges under current conditions.
</p>
<p>
  Other researchers have used global climate models to study how the geographic areas where various species occur are likely to shift as a result of climate change. Even with powerful supercomputers, however, global climate models are limited in how much detail they can provide on a regional level. The UCSC researchers thought this would be a particular problem in California, with its complex geography and diverse ecosystems. So in addition to a global climate model, they also used a regional climate model for California that provides enough detail to distinguish major mountain ranges and valleys.
</p>
<p>
  As expected, the global and regional climate models gave different results, with the regional model indicating significantly smaller potential ranges in the future for the two oak species. The main reason for the difference is that the regional model shows stronger and more rapid warming at higher elevations, whereas the global model yields average results over large areas that blur the distinction between mountains and valleys within California.
</p>
<p>
  The regional model yields a climate scenario in which the future range for blue oak shrinks to 59 percent of its current range, and for valley oak the future range shrinks to 54 percent of its current range. For both species, their potential habitat shifts northward, meaning that these species are not present in much of the area where climatic conditions will be right for them in the future.
</p>
<p>
  "Suitable habitat is lost in the southern part of the state, and about a third of the new potential habitat is in areas where blue oaks do not currently grow. Most ecologists would not be comfortable assuming that the oaks will be able to get to those new areas," Kueppers said.
</p>
<p>
  Lisa Sloan, professor of Earth sciences and a coauthor of the paper, said the shifting of ranges for oaks and other species poses a challenge for conservation planning.
</p>
<p>
  "Our state parks and other protected areas are not set up to move with climate change," said Sloan, who directs UCSC's Climate Change and Impacts Laboratory where the climate model computations were carried out.
</p>
<p>
  The other coauthors on the <i>PNAS</i> paper are postdoctoral researcher Mark Snyder; Erika Zavaleta, assistant professor of environmental studies; and Brian Fulfrost, coordinator of UCSC's Geographical Information Systems Laboratory.
</p>
<p>
  Blue oak and valley oak do not occur naturally outside of California. Blue oak is found in the foothills of the Coast Ranges and the western Sierra Nevada, while valley oak grows on deeper soils along rivers and streams, particularly in the Central Valley. Both species are sensitive to temperature and rainfall. The changes in their potential ranges under the climate change scenario were attributable primarily to increasing temperature and decreasing rainfall during the growing season, Kueppers said.
</p>
<p>
  "If this scenario is what we can expect with climate change, then these oak woodlands are going to have to adapt pretty dramatically to new conditions or move significant distances in a relatively short period of time," Kueppers said.
</p>
<p>
  The study highlights the importance of studying climate change on a regional scale, because its effects will vary from one region to another, Sloan added.
</p>
<p>
  "More intense hurricanes are the issue on the Gulf Coast, while melting sea ice is important in the Arctic," she said. "In California, the strongest effects of climate change are in the mountains, creating concern for our water supply and for the natural ecosystems that attract so many visitors."

        <title>Chancellor praises staff at Staff Advisory Board forum</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 31 Oct 2005 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>7585</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  During her first forum of the academic year, Chancellor Denice D. Denton praised the hard work of staff and singled out move-in weekend and Preview Day as successful events that were made possible by campus employees.
</p>
<p>
  "I think staff are the heart and soul of any organization," Denton told the crowd that filled Oakes 105, announcing that 3.5 percent salary increases for nonrepresented staff will be reflected in November 1 paychecks.
</p>
<p>
  During extended remarks, Denton highlighted some of the campus's top distinctions and lightheartedly encouraged audience members to share the campus's strengths during "cocktail party" conversations.
</p>
<p>
  "Word of mouth is part of marketing, so I want each of you to memorize at least one of these distinctions and tell your friends," she said, proceeding to playfully quiz the audience about UCSC's standing in several fields, including space sciences (#1), the impact of social science research (#1), the impact of arts and humanities research (#6), the impact of physical science research (#2), and the recent ninth-place ranking globally of the Economics Department's international finance program.
</p>
<p>
  Getting the word out about UCSC's excellence is key to the campus's success in fundraising and recruiting top students, staff, and faculty, she said.
</p>
<p>
  Venture philanthropists want to invest in excellence, and then "our success becomes their success," said Denton. "Students want to go to the best place with world-class staff and faculty."
</p>
<p>
  She encouraged the campus community to participate in <a href="http://celebration2005.ucsc.edu/">Celebration 2005</a> events surrounding her investiture as chancellor, which she called "a different kind of inauguration" that will focus on academic programs, student support, and campus partnerships with the community and region.
</p>
<p>
  Striking a more somber tone, Denton also noted events that have challenged the campus this fall, including the deaths of three undergraduate students. "There's no way to soften this blow, but staff, faculty, and students responded and really helped the families," said Denton.
</p>
<p>
  Hurricane Katrina also tapped the talents of staff, particularly in Admissions and Student Affairs, which handled inquiries from numerous displaced students. "At least 25 students have been admitted, in addition to graduate students and several displaced faculty members," she said.
</p>
<p>
  Denton acknowledged that the bus strike has placed "serious strain" on many in the campus community and the county, and she hailed efforts by Transportation and Parking Services (TAPS) and TAPS Director Wes Scott, who received a round of applause, to ease the inconvenience.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, Denton discussed her administration's response to a "different environment" on campus characterized by incidents of violence and vandalism. "It's edgy," she said. In response, Denton's team is taking a proactive approach that involves, in part, engaging broader representation of the campus community, including faculty, in planning events.
</p>
<p>
  This new strategy received its first test during the campus's October 18 career fair, the first held since a similar event last spring at which a student intern received serious injuries during a demonstration by those opposed to the participation of military recruiters. Denton, who deemed the event a success, said her goals had been to allow for "peaceful demonstration" and the expression of differing opinions while ensuring that students, recruiters, and campus staff members could safely attend the fair.
</p>
<p>
  On the salary front, Denton said negotiations are ongoing with representatives of the Coalition of University Employees, University Professional and Technical Employees, the California Nurses Association, and skilled crafts. She noted that the campus is engaged in a salary equity study and that she has met personally with Howard Pripas, executive director of UC Labor Relations, as well as UC President Robert C. Dynes and UC Provost M.R.C. Greenwood, to discuss staff compensation.
</p>
<p>
  In addition, the UC Regents have undertaken a major systemwide review of university compensation, including "net compensation," which includes benefits, pension, and salary. "There's a fair amount of movement happening there, but it's going to be a chipping away process," said Denton, who expects to have results of both the local report and the Regents' compensation study by the winter-quarter staff forum.
</p>
<p>
  Responding to a question, Denton explained that there is "no quid pro quo" when the university receives a gift from a donor, and that the campus is not beholden to the views or wishes of givers. "We aren't selling off the campus," she said. "When people give a gift, it's a gift."
</p>
<p>
  Throughout the forum, Denton translated some of her remarks into Spanish, saying she wanted to practice what she learned growing up in Houston and acknowledge the asset that Spanish-speaking employees provide to the campus.
</p>
<p>
  Denton reiterated her commitment to increased communication and said her technology team is developing an e-mail alias system to replace the "e-mail tree" currently used to distribute administrative messages to the campus. "If you feel out of the loop, if you don't feel you're getting the messages, what's your alternative?" she asked. "That's right--<em>Currents Online."</em>

<p>
  UC employees have a rare opportunity to enroll in the UC-sponsored Supplemental Disability Plan during the annual open enrollment period for health and welfare plans, November 1 through November 30.
</p>
<p>
  The disability plan will be open for new enrollments, and those already enrolled may change their waiting period. No statement of health will be required. The plan has not been open for enrollment in nearly 15 years and is not likely to be open again.
</p>
<p>
  A representative from the supplemental disability insurance company, Liberty Mutual, will be on campus on Thursday, November 3, to make brief presentations regarding the program and to answer questions. There will be two sessions--one from 10:30 to 11 a.m. and another from noon to 12:30 p.m.--in the Bay Tree Conference Center, Room D. Seating is limited, so <a href="http://bas.ucsc.edu/events">sign up online</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The new year will also bring changes in health costs, including changes in copayments and fluctuations in premiums.
</p>
<p>
  All the important details are at the <a href="http://atyourservice.ucop.edu/">At Your Service</a> web site. Open enrollment transactions can be completed and confirmed online.

<p>
  The New World and the Old Country come together in a special symphonic concert set for November 4 and 5, at 7:30 p.m. in the Music Center Recital Hall. The UC Santa Cruz Orchestra, conducted by Professor Nicole Paiement, will perform the world premiere of the orchestral version of <i>Parcel From America,</i> a Christmas tale of Irish music, song, dance, and storytelling by native Irish writer/storyteller Tomaseen Foley. The program will also include Czech composer Antonin Dvorak's symphony Symphony No. 9 in E minor, subtitled <i>From the New World.</i>
</p>
<p>
  Paiement and UCSC lecturer, guitarist, and recording artist William Coulter have teamed up with Santa Cruz composer/musician Barry Phillips to present <i>Parcel From America</i>, which weaves a story from Foley's youth in Ireland. Based on one of the stories from Foley's popular touring production <i>A Celtic Christmas</i>--which Coulter has performed in and been musical director of since1996--<i>Parcel</i> has typically been performed by a band of Celtic musicians. Coulter's longtime collaborator Barry Phillips recently arranged the piece for orchestra, and this new version will receive its premiere at the UCSC concert.
</p>
<p>
  <i>Parcel from America</i> will feature the UCSC Orchestra, guitarist Coulter, and storyteller Foley--plus David Brewer on uilleann pipes and whistle, Deby Benton Grosjean on fiddle, vocalist Moira Smiley, and Irish dancers Kathleen Keane and Bethany Duff. This concert is presented by the UCSC Music Department with additional support from a Porter College Visiting Artists grant. For ticket information, contact the UCSC Ticket Office at (831) 459-2159.

        <title>Nirvikar Singh receives IBM Faculty Award</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 31 Oct 2005 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>

        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  Professor of economics Nirvikar Singh has received a prestigious 2005 IBM Faculty Award of $20,000. These awards are intended to recognize outstanding faculty and to promote innovative, collaborative research in disciplines of mutual interest to IBM and the researcher.
</p>
<p>
  Singh's collaboration with IBM will focus on business transformation and the management of communication and change across organizational cultures. The goal is to generate insights that can improve the organizational architectures and business processes that govern information technology services engagements. In particular, experiments conducted at UCSC and IBM will seek to identify factors that enhance positive organizational change.
</p>
<p>
  Singh is collaborating with economics professor Daniel Friedman and IBM researcher Paul Maglio to conduct these experiments. Subjects will be organized in teams, and the speed of accurate communication of technical information will be measured under different conditions, such as changing team composition, different background knowledge, and varied communication chain structures.
</p>
<p>
  Singh is a first-time recipient of the award. IBM Faculty Awards are competitive awards that are renewable annually.

<p>
  Margaret Delaney, professor of ocean sciences, has been named editor of <i>Earth and Planetary Science Letters</i>, a major journal in the field of Earth sciences.
</p>
<p>
  <i>EPSL</i> is among the most highly visible and widely distributed journals published by Elsevier, a leading publisher of scientific journals. It covers research into all aspects of the geosciences, including lunar studies, plate tectonics, ocean floor spreading, and continental drift, as well as basic studies of the physical, chemical, and mechanical properties of the Earth's crust and mantle, the atmosphere, and the hydrosphere.
</p>
<p>
  "It's very prestigious, one of the premier journals covering a broad range of research in Earth sciences, ocean sciences, and related fields," said Kenneth Bruland, professor and chair of ocean sciences.
</p>
<p>
  Delaney's three-year appointment as editor of <i>EPSL</i> began in September. She has previously served as editor of the journal <i>Paleocoeanography</i>. Delaney's research interests are in paleoceanography and marine geochemistry, especially the nutrient history of the oceans. She is a fellow of the American Geophysical Union and a director of the Geochemical Society.

<p>
  By Scott Rappaport
</p>
<p>
  The UCSC Center for Cultural Studies will present "States of War: A Symposium on the Geopolitical Logic of Contemporary Capitalism" on Saturday, October 29, from 1 to 5:30 p.m. at Oakes College, Room 105. Admission is free and open to the public.
</p>
<p>
  Participants in the event will include:
</p>
<p>
  * Iain Boal, T. J. Clark, Joseph Matthews, and Michael Watts--four members of the Bay Area political collective RETORT and authors of the book <i>Afflicted Powers: Capital and Spectacle in a New Age of War</i> (Verso, 2005)
</p>
<p>
  * Gopal Balakrishnan, <i>New Left Review</i> editor and a Rockefeller Fellow at UCSC's Center for Cultural Studies
</p>
<p>
  * Robert Brenner, UCLA historian, political economist, and frequent contributor to <i>New Left Review</i> and <i>Against the Current</i>
</p>
<p>
  * Jennifer Whitney, activist/organizer and an editor of the book <i>We are Everywhere: The Irresistible Rise of Global Anticapitalism</i> (Verso, 2003)
</p>
<p>
  UCSC associate professor of literature Christopher Connery described the focus of the symposium. "In the 1990s, there was an idea on the left, and elsewhere, that the era of nation states was passing into the era of global capitalism--that the common interests of global capitalism had now trumped national interests," he said. "But after September 11, the unilateral efforts by the United States to shape the world according to its particular self-interest have suggested that this globalist judgment was premature. So we have invited the authors of <i>Afflicted Powers</i> to talk about what is happening now in the world, how to characterize it, and what an analysis of the current era suggests about the future of globalization and capitalism."
</p>
<p>
  "A number of people have found in <i>Afflicted Powers</i> an original and useful account of the post-9/11 world, and of U.S. policy motivations," Connery added. "It is also a book that calls for new modes of resistance. This is an event that wants to engage that book seriously, to see what a discussion and critique produces."
</p>
<p>
  The symposium is the first of three quarterly events in 2005-06 that are part of the Center for Cultural Studies' three-year "Other Globalizations" project, funded by the Rockefeller Foundation. It includes the participation of Rockefeller Fellow Gopal Balakrishnan, a visiting scholar in the humanities at UCSC this year. Balakrishnan's project for his Rockefeller Fellowship, "Future Wars," examines the role that military power will play in shaping the international law and world market conventions of the 21st century.
</p>
<p>
  The Center for Cultural Studies at UCSC was founded in 1988 as a part of the University of California President's Humanities Initiative. It is now in its 18th year. Through an ensemble of research clusters, conferences, workshops, visiting scholars, publications, film series, and a Resident Scholars Program, the center has encouraged a broad range of research in the rapidly evolving field of cultural studies.
</p>
<p>
  <i>Copies of</i> Afflicted Powers<i>are available at a discount at the Literary Guillotine, 204 Locust St., Santa Cruz, (831) 457-1195. Audience members are encouraged to read the book before the symposium. For more information, contact the UCSC Center for Cultural Studies at (831) 459-4899 or <a href="mailto:cult@ucsc.edu">cult@ucsc.edu.</a></i>

<p>
  Some seats are still available for Chancellor Denice D. Denton's investiture November 4 and the academic symposium November 3-4, "Achieving Excellence Through Diversity." Event organizers, however, are encouraging those who wish to attend either or both of the events to register online soon.
</p>
<p>
  The weekend's Scholarship Benefits Dinner, an annual event that raises badly needed funds for undergraduate and graduate students, is already sold out.
</p>
<p>
  Tickets to the investiture are available on a first-come, first-served basis. Guests will be seated first in the Music Recital Hall (main venue) and next in the Media Theater (simulcast venue).
</p>
<p>
  The symposium will feature Shirley Ann Jackson, president of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, leading a discussion on the best practices in diversity, access, and inclusion. It will be at 2:30 p.m. on Thursday, November 3, at the Media Theater, and continue at 8:30 a.m. on Friday at the University Center.

        <title>Todd Newberry shares wisdom gained from a lifelong passion in The Ardent Birder</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 24 Oct 2005 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>7565</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  In <i>The Ardent Birder,</i> published this month by Ten Speed Press, Todd Newberry shares the wisdom of a lifelong birder, an accomplished scientist, and an extraordinary teacher. The book is packed with valuable tips on how to become a better birder, as well as interesting stories and information about birds, but its real subject is the experience of being a birder.
</p>
<p>
  In 50 short essays, Newberry addresses topics ranging from the practical (aiming binoculars) to the philosophical (do seagulls play?). Illustrated with delightful drawings by Gene Holtan, the essays are elegant and insightful meditations on the challenges and rewards of birdwatching.
</p>
<p>
  Newberry, a professor emeritus of ecology and evolutionary biology, focused on marine invertebrates as a researcher, but birding has been his lifelong avocation. A popular and influential teacher at UCSC (he won the Distinguished Teaching Award in 1987), Newberry retired in 1994 but has found that birding continues to provide new opportunities to teach.
</p>
<p>
  In his biology classes, Newberry said, he tried to teach students how to become "investigative reporters of nature." Birders can do that, too, and Newberry explains in <i>The Ardent Birder</i> how to move beyond asking the basic question of "Who are you?" when observing birds in the field. One of the most entertaining and instructive essays in the book involves an imagined "interview" with some godwits on a mudflat. The exercise gives a hint of Newberry's own remarkable skills as an investigative reporter of nature.
</p>
<p>
  Newberry said he set out to write a book for intermediate birders, because there seemed to be good books already available for beginners and advanced birders. He calls advanced birders the "varsity" (professionals are "major leaguers"), and at one point the book was about how to join the varsity. But in the end, Newberry produced a book that will appeal to all ardent birders regardless of their skills, and even nonbirders are likely to enjoy many of the essays.
</p>
<p>
  What makes someone an ardent birder? Newberry explains it in terms of an emotional attachment to nature that comes from experiencing those special moments when, as he puts it, "lightning strikes." For Newberry, lightning struck for the first time when he was a boy in boarding school and a meadowlark shot up from the ground at his feet. Those moments of exhilaration and awe are essential to understanding why birders pursue their avian obsession with such passion.
</p>
<p>
  "The thing that bonds us are those special moments. It's a private thing, but I think it's something we all share," he said.
</p>
<p>
  Since his retirement, Newberry has taught occasional courses on birds at UCSC. He also leads outings of the local bird club and will be guiding visitors during the first annual Monterey Bay Birding Festival in November. (For more information, visit the <a href="http://www.montereybaybirding.org/">festival web site</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The Monterey Bay region is one of the great birding hot spots of North America. "People come from all over to go birding here," Newberry said.
</p>
<p>
  But wherever they may go, birders of all kinds are sure to find pleasure and inspiration in <i>The Ardent Birder.</i>
</p>
<p>
  Newberry's writing has appeared in <i>Omnivore, The Antioch Review, The North American Review,</i> and <i>Three Penny Review.</i> He came to UCSC as a founding faculty member when the campus opened in 1965. He earned a B.A. in biology from Princeton University and a Ph.D. in biology from Stanford University.
</p>
<p>
  The artist, Gene Holtan, has devoted a long life to the visual arts, painting and drawing in a range of media including paper, canvas, pottery, and children's books. After many years in Santa Cruz, he now lives in Oakland.

<p>
  As a child, Dug Stanat didn't watch much television, and his parents frowned on cartoons. So it's a little ironic that Stanat now makes his living bringing movies like <i>Shrek 2</i> and <i>Madagascar</i> to the screen.
</p>
<p>
  Stanat is a digital puppet maker, transforming static computer-generated models into virtual marionettes.
</p>
<p>
  Like Geppetto the puppeteer in <i>Pinocchio</i>, Stanat adds the joints, muscles, and "strings" that today's animators pull to make characters move, smile, and, in the case of <i>Madagascar's</i> penguins, waddle.
</p>
<p>
  It's a fitting job for Stanat, who became interested in three-dimensional animation while making sculpture after college.
</p>
<p>
  During high school, Stanat had used an 8-millimeter camera to make short stop-motion films. As a sculptor, he wanted to make his colorful mixed-media creatures move, and digital three-dimensional technology gave him the tools to do it.
</p>
<p>
  "As a sculptor, I enjoyed showing people something they hadn't seen before," says Stanat, whose <a href="http://www.dugosaurus.com/">wild creations</a> bring to mind gargoyles, Oaxacan carvings, and Balinese masks. "I've always been fascinated by things that eat people--crocodiles, white sharks, creatures from the past, and creatures from my mind."
</p>
<p>
  When Stanat shifted media and began creating animated 3-D images on the computer, he was hooked.
</p>
<p>
  He found the process mentally challenging in ways that were quite different from sculpting. "I had a whole catalog of creatures from my sculpting days that I wanted to create--but I needed to figure out how to do it," he says. "Intellectually, it was far more engaging than sculpture. I used to listen to music or the radio while sculpting, but I can't do that when I'm working in 3-D."
</p>
<p>
  Stanat dropped sculpture completely, and before long, he compiled a demo reel of his personal projects. He sent one to PDI (now PDI/DreamWorks), and to his surprise, he landed a job with the studio a few months later. Today he works with some of the best in the field, including Dick Walsh, who won a technical achievement Academy Award for developing PDI's facial animation system.
</p>
<p>
  Character technical directors like Stanat bridge the modeling and animation departments, he explains. Modelers create the three-dimensional character, or model, which Stanat and his colleagues "rig" for the animators. Stanat, who specializes in faces, says a typical character will have several hundred controls just in the face. "If a character is well-designed, animators will be able to go in at a very fine level to get just the expressions they want," he explains. "We get involved very early in the production pipeline. It's an extremely collaborative process."
</p>
<p>
  Seeing creatures come to life is a long and complex process, both on personal projects and in the studio. When rigging a character at work, Stanat usually runs some early animation tests himself, but it's a whole different experience to see what animators can accomplish with the characters. "The more a rig is pushed and abused, or used in unexpected ways, the more exciting it is to see--as long as the rig holds up," he says. When a rig fails, that's exciting, too. "It means we'll have to try something different, develop a new technique, or even develop new technology. That challenge is part of the fun," he adds.
</p>
<p>
  <i>Shrek 2</i> and <i>Madagascar</i> represented different technical challenges, Stanat explains. The directors of <i>Shrek 2</i> wanted a film that was more visually sophisticated than its predecessor, while the directors of <i>Madagascar</i> sought an "extremely cartoony animation far beyond what any realistic face would be able to do."
</p>
<p>
  By the time a film makes it to the theater, Stanat has been off the project for some time. "It is a lot of fun to see the final product," he says. "Not just seeing your own work, but the work of your co-workers come to life. There is pride in what our team has accomplished."
</p>
<p>
  There's a lot of camaraderie at PDI/DreamWorks, says Stanat, adding that his department is "very international--at one point, we had someone from every continent but Antarctica."
</p>
<p>
  Looking back, Stanat traces quite a winding path from high school to studying economics and environmental studies at UCSC and now to film work.
</p>
<p>
  Always an artistic kid, he became "obsessed" during high school in North Carolina with the threat of nuclear weapons, and pursued his interest at UCSC. "It's where my dark mind was drawn, but it's not where I took my pleasure," he says. "Somewhere along the line, I got the idea that if you enjoy something, it's not worthwhile. I didn't necessarily know school could be fun."
</p>
<p>
  When Stanat moved into his UCSC dorm room in 1985, he was the only person on his floor with a personal computer. His parents had sent him off to school with an original Apple Macintosh, today's computer equivalent of a <i>Tyrannosaurus rex</i>. Stanat quickly mastered the early art applications and dabbled in computer graphics and programming while working toward his degree.
</p>
<p>
  "My first computer animations were done using MacPaint," he recalls. "I would create two pictures, paste one on top of the other, and then hit the 'undo' key to 'play' the two-frame loop. Ridiculous, but it was all that was available to me at the time."
</p>
<p>
  Stanat marvels at his decision-making process when he recalls what motivated his move to Santa Cruz. "I really enjoyed flying kites at the time, and I figured Santa Cruz would have really good conditions for kites," he says. "It was one of my luckiest silly decisions ever."
</p>
<p>
  Now, riding campus bike trails with his 6-year-old son, Stanat says he is more overwhelmed by the redwoods and the campus's natural beauty than he was as a college student. "Having the good fortune to find yourself in such a beautiful place by chance really is outstanding," says Stanat, who also had the good fortune at UCSC to meet the woman who is now his wife. Shawn Phillips (anthropology, Porter '88) met Stanat during his freshman year. The couple have two young sons, Oslo and Rio. They live in Fremont, California.
</p>
<p>
  Stanat is currently working on <i>Shrek 3</i>.

        <title>Journalist Dahr Jamail draws capacity crowd for Iraq update</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_7559" align="alignright" width="235"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/10/jamail_dahr.05-10-24.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7559" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/10/jamail_dahr.05-10-24.jpg" alt="Cowell College provost Deanna Shemek joins Dahr Jamail as he meets with audience members following his talk.

<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  Journalist Dahr Jamail chose his words carefully when trying to answer a young boy's question about the U.S. bombing of Fallujah.
</p>
<p>
  "The military has to follow orders from above," said Jamail, one of few independent U.S. journalists covering the war in Iraq, who spoke to a capacity crowd at the UCSC Music Center Recital Hall on October 19.
</p>
<p>
  "Even when their own commanders don't agree with the orders, the military has to follow orders. They are being put in horrible circumstances, where horrible things are happening to them, and they are doing horrible things."
</p>
<p>
  A special correspondent for <i>Flashpoints</i>, the BBC<i>, Democracy Now,</i> and other media outlets, Jamail doesn't often field questions from 8-year-olds. But he has spent eight months in occupied Iraq, chronicling what he called the "failed policy" of the White House, and his audience was spellbound throughout his 90-minute slide-show presentation.
</p>
<p>
  Fallujah is a "microcosm" of the war, he said.
</p>
<p>
  "At the time of the invasion, Fallujah welcomed the Americans," said Jamail. But three weeks later, when U.S. forces occupied an elementary school, residents protested. Classes were scheduled to begin the next day, and they wanted their children to be able to attend school, he said. The protest was met by gunfire, and 17 people were killed, according to Jamail.
</p>
<p>
  That day marked the birth of the resistance movement in Fallujah, but hostilities escalated steadily as the military brought in U.S. contractors--"I prefer to call them mercenaries, because that's what they are," added Jamail--because they are not bound by military rules of engagement. "They conduct covert operations and assassinations," he said. "They literally raped and pillaged."
</p>
<p>
  The first U.S. siege of Fallujah took place in April 2004 following the widely reported gruesome slaying of four contractors, whose remains were hung from a bridge. Even then, according to Jamail, U.S. military leaders didn't want to seize the city.
</p>
<p>
  "They wanted to work on reconstruction and try to earn the trust of the Iraqis," he said, noting that it was the White House that issued a direct order for the siege. The failure of that attack led to the November 2004 siege, during which 4,000 civilians were killed. It constituted the most intense urban fighting of the war, said Jamail.
</p>
<p>
  As part of his presentation, Jamail screened a new independent film, <i><a href="http://www.conceptionmedia.net">Caught in the Crossfire: The Untold Story of Falluja</a></i>. The film's footage of the suffering of displaced residents and the decimation of the city, 60 percent of which was bombed to the ground by U.S. forces last November, had prompted the young boy's query.
</p>
<p>
  Today, U.S. commanders in Iraq compare battling Iraqi resistance to stepping on a half-filled water balloon, said Jamail, "You step on one part, and it squeezes out the other side."
</p>
<p>
  The U.S. media is ignoring the story of civilian suffering in Iraq, said Jamail, who blamed poor coverage on corporate ownership of the media, reporters who try to cover the war from their hotels, and the Pentagon's efforts to avoid a repeat of the Vietnam War, when horrific images on the nightly news eroded public support for the war.
</p>
<p>
  One of the most "undertold" stories of the war is the widespread use of depleted uranium in bullets, missiles, and bombs. Spent artillery is leaving a legacy of radioactive dust across Iraq, said Jamail, noting that more than 1,200 tons of depleted uranium have been used in Iraq so far--three times the amount used in the 1991 Gulf War. Depleted uranium has been identified as "a main component" of Gulf War syndrome, and leukemia rates in Iraq among children aged 1 to 5 increased 26-fold between 1990 and 2003, he said.
</p>
<p>
  Jamail cited a U.S. Army survey that found 56 percent of units currently in Iraq have low or very low morale, and a report by the Army's Surgeon Generalthat 30 percent of U.S. military personnel have reported mental health problems within three months of returning from Iraq. "My intent is not to demonize soldiers," said Jamail. "They are victims of failed policies as much as the Iraqi civilians. Anyone, anywhere, anytime, could attack them. Overall, they've been put in the middle of a very bad situation."
</p>
<p>
  Jamail also discussed his <a href="http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=viewArticle&code=20050625&articleId=532%20%20http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=viewArticle&code=20050625&articleId=532%20%20">invited testimony</a> before the World Tribunal on Iraq (WTI) in June, describing the rampant torture of detainees, the catastrophic state of the health care system in Iraq, and a summary of conditions "on the ground" after two-and-one-half years of the occupation. The WTI is a worldwide network of local groups and individuals opposed to the war. Among the highlights of his testimony:
</p>
<p>
  * Abuses at Abu Ghraib Prison are the "tip of the iceberg," with torture common in Afghanistan, Guantanamo Bay, and third-country dungeons.
</p>
<p>
  * U.S. medics, doctors, and nurses are complicit in torture of detainees.
</p>
<p>
  * Hospitals face critical shortages of medicine, supplies, and equipment, and requests are being ignored. One hospital director said his facility receives only 15 percent of the water needed for basic sterilization.
</p>
<p>
  * Hospital raids by U.S. military forces that prevent doctors from providing care now appear to be "standard operating procedure."
</p>
<p>
  * Iraqis regularly endure long lines to purchase gasoline, sometimes waiting for two days.
</p>
<p>
  * Electricity in much of the country is available for only three hours a day, and even the "best areas" of Baghdad receive electricity for only six to eight hours a day.
</p>
<p>
  * Unemployment has reached 70 percent.
</p>
<p>
  * Clean water is scarce, raw sewage is common, and diseases, including diarrhea, typhoid, cholera, and hepatitis, pose a growing threat to public health.

<p>
  Programs and services as varied as Big Brothers/Big Sisters, Suicide Prevention Services, the "Transitions" Hospice Caring Project, Walnut Avenue Women's Center, and the Santa Cruz AIDS Project are funded by the Santa Cruz County United Way.
</p>
<p>
  The campus community will be asked to help out with these and other programs when the annual United Way campaign begins in late October.
</p>
<p>
  A new option this year is Spanish-language pledge forms, which may be downloaded from the UCSC <a href="http://united-way.ucsc.edu/">United Way website</a>.
</p>
<p>
  United Way's administration and fundraising costs combined are 15 percent, a much lower proportion than for many charities. Additional information about the United Way of Santa Cruz County is available <a href="http://www.unitedwaysc.org/">online.</a>
</p>
<p>
  Look for United Way materials, including a letter from Academic Senate chair Faye Crosby and the Staff Advisory Board, in your mailbox soon. The pledge deadline is November 14.
</p><strong>Requently asked questions</strong>
<p>
  <strong>Q: If I am already giving, and I don't want to make changes to my contribution, do I need to do anything?</strong>
</p>
<p>
  A: No, you do not. Your contribution will automatically continue.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Q: Does the United Way give to the Boy Scouts?</strong>
</p>
<p>
  A: No, the Santa Cruz County United Way does not. That organization was taken off the recipient list due to refusal to sign the nondiscrimination form required by the Santa Cruz County United Way. However, you can designate a donation specifically to the Boy Scouts or any other nonprofit organization by completing part C. on your pledge form.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Q: How do I know where my donation goes?</strong>
</p>
<p>
  A: All monies donated in Santa Cruz County stay in Santa Cruz County to support local agencies. Monies donated to the United Way general fund support the United Way sponsored agencies. You can direct your donation to a designated United Way agency or to any qualifying nonprofit organization.

  Those planning to attend Chancellor Denice Denton's investiture November 4 and the academic symposium November 3-4, "Achieving Excellence Through Diversity," are being asked to register online.

  The weekend's Scholarship Benefits Dinner, an annual event that raises badly needed funds for undergraduate and graduate students, is already sold out.

  Tickets to the investiture are available on a first-come, first-served basis. Guests will be seated first in the Music Recital Hall (main venue) and next in the Media Theater (simulcast venue).

<p>
  The symposium will feature Shirley Ann Jackson, president of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, leading a discussion on the best practices in diversity, access, and inclusion. It will be at 2:30 p.m. on Thursday, November 3, at the Media Theater, and continue at 8:30 a.m. on Friday at the University Center's Bhojwani Room.

<p>
  Fourteen visitors from South Korea, Japan, Nigeria, Italy, Mexico, Greece, and Nepal joined six UCSC students for a 10-day course on sustainable agriculture offered through UCSC's Program In Community and Agroecology (PICA).
</p>
<p>
  The course, which ran July 6-16, focused on current agroecology research that will be valuable to participants in field and academic settings in their home countries, said PICA director Karen Nordstrom. Participants attended numerous workshops, including sessions on organic olive production and cob construction, a building method that makes use of local resources, including earth, straw, rice stalks, and other materials that are often considered agricultural waste products. Participants built a cob oven to learn about the process. Cob structures are long-lasting and naturally insulated from extremes of heat and cold.

<p>
  McHenry Library research specialist Joanne Nelson has been named Volunteer of the Year by the Santa Cruz Museum of Art & History. Nelson served as the history docent liaison to the museum's Volunteer Council in 2001. She also served as council vice-chair in 2004 and was elected chairperson that same year.
</p>
<p>
  Nelson has assisted at countless museum programs and events, and she was recently appointed to the position of research assistant for the museum's archives. She can be found every Tuesday cataloging history books in the archives, saving the museum thousands of dollars in professional fees.
</p>
<p>
  "At MAH, volunteering gives me a link to the past and to future generations," said Nelson. "As a volunteer, I recognize that I can achieve much more together with others than on my own."
</p>
<p>
  Nelson has worked at McHenry Library since 1989.

<p>
  Assistant professor of theater arts Kimberly Jannarone is working as both an actor and a dramaturg in Ted Hughes's version of <i>Alcestis</i>, an ancient Greek tragicomedy by Euripides that tells the tale of a woman who takes her husband's place when death comes for him.
</p>
<p>
  The production is co-produced by Theater Emory, a professional theater company associated with Emory University, and Out of Hand Theater, a troupe that <i>American Theater</i> magazine included in its recent article titled "Hot, Hip and on the Verge: A Dozen Young American Companies You Need to Know."
</p>
<p>
  Jannarone is in residence at Emory this fall as part of a faculty exchange program with the Emory Classics Department.

        <title>Todd Newberry shares wisdom gained from a lifelong passion in The Ardent Birder</title>

<p>
  In <i>The Ardent Birder,</i> published this month by Ten Speed Press, Todd Newberry shares the wisdom of a lifelong birder, an accomplished scientist, and an extraordinary teacher. The book is packed with valuable tips on how to become a better birder, as well as interesting stories and information about birds, but its real subject is the experience of being a birder.
</p>
<p>
  In 50 short essays, Newberry addresses topics ranging from the practical (aiming binoculars) to the philosophical (do seagulls play?). Illustrated with delightful drawings by Gene Holtan, the essays are elegant and insightful meditations on the challenges and rewards of birdwatching.
</p>
<p>
  Newberry, a professor emeritus of ecology and evolutionary biology, focused on marine invertebrates as a researcher, but birding has been his lifelong avocation. A popular and influential teacher at UCSC (he won the Distinguished Teaching Award in 1987), Newberry retired in 1994 but has found that birding continues to provide new opportunities to teach.
</p>
<p>
  In his biology classes, Newberry said, he tried to teach students how to become "investigative reporters of nature." Birders can do that, too, and Newberry explains in <i>The Ardent Birder</i> how to move beyond asking the basic question of "Who are you?" when observing birds in the field. One of the most entertaining and instructive essays in the book involves an imagined "interview" with some godwits on a mudflat. The exercise gives a hint of Newberry's own remarkable skills as an investigative reporter of nature.
</p>
<p>
  Newberry said he set out to write a book for intermediate birders, because there seemed to be good books already available for beginners and advanced birders. He calls advanced birders the "varsity" (professionals are "major leaguers"), and at one point the book was about how to join the varsity. But in the end, Newberry produced a book that will appeal to all ardent birders regardless of their skills, and even nonbirders are likely to enjoy many of the essays.
</p>
<p>
  What makes someone an ardent birder? Newberry explains it in terms of an emotional attachment to nature that comes from experiencing those special moments when, as he puts it, "lightning strikes." For Newberry, lightning struck for the first time when he was a boy in boarding school and a meadowlark shot up from the ground at his feet. Those moments of exhilaration and awe are essential to understanding why birders pursue their avian obsession with such passion.
</p>
<p>
  "The thing that bonds us are those special moments. It's a private thing, but I think it's something we all share," he said.
</p>
<p>
  Since his retirement, Newberry has taught occasional courses on birds at UCSC. He also leads outings of the local bird club and will be guiding visitors during the first annual Monterey Bay Birding Festival in November. (For more information, visit the <a href="http://www.montereybaybirding.org/">festival web site</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The Monterey Bay region is one of the great birding hot spots of North America. "People come from all over to go birding here," Newberry said.
</p>
<p>
  But wherever they may go, birders of all kinds are sure to find pleasure and inspiration in <i>The Ardent Birder.</i>
</p>
<p>
  Newberry's writing has appeared in <i>Omnivore, The Antioch Review, The North American Review,</i> and <i>Three Penny Review.</i> He came to UCSC as a founding faculty member when the campus opened in 1965. He earned a B.A. in biology from Princeton University and a Ph.D. in biology from Stanford University.
</p>
<p>
  The artist, Gene Holtan, has devoted a long life to the visual arts, painting and drawing in a range of media including paper, canvas, pottery, and children's books. After many years in Santa Cruz, he now lives in Oakland.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_7541" align="alignright" width="161"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/10/logo.05-10-17.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7541" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/10/logo.05-10-17.jpg" alt="" width="161" height="81" /></a>[/caption]

<p>
  UCSC and Los Alamos National Laboratory have agreed to establish a new collaborative institute for research and education in the area of scientific data management.
</p>
<p>
  The Institute for Scalable Scientific Data Management (ISSDM) will address looming issues of data storage and management for projects that involve large-scale simulation and computing.
</p>
<p>
  "This new partnership builds on a history of fruitful scientific collaboration between UCSC faculty and students and Los Alamos scientists. The educational and research programs supported by the institute will benefit both partners while addressing major challenges in scientific computing," said UCSC Chancellor Denice D. Denton.
</p>
<p>
  The institute will provide opportunities for UCSC graduate students to gain specialized experience and expertise in this area by working on large-scale computing projects at Los Alamos. In addition, the students who take advantage of these opportunities will provide a pool of potential employees for the laboratory with skills in key areas of computer science and data management where the lab foresees significant staff needs in the future.
</p>
<p>
  "We want to be able to hire people who already understand our problems and can come in and be immediately productive. This partnership will provide a valuable pipeline for recruitment and retention of staff in a key area for the laboratory," said Gary Grider of the High Performance Computing Systems Integration Group at Los Alamos.
</p>
<p>
  UCSC's Storage Systems Research Center (SSRC) is a leading center for data-management research, and the expertise of faculty in this area made UCSC an ideal choice for this partnership, said Grider, who will direct the institute at Los Alamos.
</p>
<p>
  Increases in computational power are driving the need for improvements in scientific data management. When powerful supercomputers run large-scale simulations of complex physical processes, enormous amounts of data are generated every second. The challenge for computer scientists is how to manage and store such a massive influx of data, said Darrell Long, who holds the Kumar Malavalli Endowed Chair in Storage Systems Research at UCSC and will serve as the campus director of the new institute.
</p>
<p>
  "The amount of data you may have to handle is on the scale of petabytes, or one quadrillion bytes. Doing data storage and data management for things that large is a real challenge," Long said.
</p>
<p>
  The problem is much the same in the case of scientific experiments in which a large array of sensors are used to collect data, resulting in a flood of real-time data coming from the sensors. Grider said the institute will address aspects of data management related to both simulation data and real-time experimental data.
</p>
<p>
  "We have challenges now with the vast amounts of simulation data we generate using the large computational platforms we have. And what we see on the horizon is an explosion of real-time experimental data coming from the engineering, manufacturing, and experimental side of the lab," Grider said Los Alamos has established similar institutes focusing on other disciplines in partnership with other UC campuses, including UC San Diego and UC Santa Barbara. Los Alamos also has announced a partnership to form an advanced studies institute with three New Mexico universities.
</p>
<p>
  At UCSC, the primary participants in the ISSDM will be faculty and students affiliated with the SSRC, one of the major research groups in the Baskin School of Engineering. Directed by Long, the SSRC is focused on improving the performance, security, and reliability of data-storage systems and software.
</p>
<p>
  The educational component of the new institute will include specialized courses delivered at both Los Alamos and UCSC via a two-way Internet link. Los Alamos senior scientists will serve as adjunct professors, lecturers, and mentors in the program.
</p>
<p>
  "This allows us to offer courses that wouldn't otherwise be possible. It enables students to learn about things that very few institutions have the resources to offer," Long said.
</p>
<p>
  <i>Los Alamos National Laboratory is operated by the University of California for the National Nuclear Security Administration of the U.S. Department of Energy and works in partnership with NNSA's Sandia and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories to support NNSA in its mission. Los Alamos enhances global security by ensuring the safety and reliability of the U.S. nuclear weapons stockpile, developing technical solutions to reduce the threat of weapons of mass destruction and solving problems related to energy, environment, infrastructure, health, and national security concerns.</i>

<p>
  Sharmila Tagore, one of India's most famous film stars, and Indian art historian Partha Mitter will be the featured speakers at the fifth annual Sidhartha Maitra Memorial Lecture on Sunday, October 23, at 4 p.m. in the UCSC Music Center Recital Hall.
</p>
<p>
  The event will also feature the 50th anniversary screening of a restored print of Indian film director Satyajit Ray's trailblazing first film, <i>Pather Panchali</i>, which kicked off the "Classics" series at the 2005 Cannes Film Festival.
</p>
<p>
  The series focused this year on the preservation mission of the Film Foundation established in New York by Martin Scorsese with Woody Allen, Francis Ford Coppola, Stanley Kubrick, George Lucas, Sydney Pollack, Robert Redford, Steven Spielberg, Robert Altman, and Clint Eastwood. Ray's <i>Pather Panchali</i> and Jean Renoir's <i>The River</i> were the two films chosen to represent the mission of the foundation, which is to restore and preserve works "to assure the future of the cinema of the past."
</p>
<p>
  The restoration of Ray's film was spearheaded by Dilip Basu, director of the Satyajit Ray Film and Study Collection (Ray FASC)--an archive on the UCSC campus that holds 31 of Ray's 36 films and more than 7,000 journals, scrapbooks, posters, stills, books, records, and other memorabilia. The films are restored, and housed in climate-controlled vaults, at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in Los Angeles.
</p>
<p>
  The Sidhartha Maitra Memorial Lecture--presented by Ray FASC--was established in 2001 by Anuradha Luther Maitra in honor of her husband, who was a scientist, entrepreneur, and admirer of the late Indian film director's work. Ray FASC was founded in 1993 to acquire, preserve, and provide scholarly access to Ray's films, papers, books, and artwork.
</p>
<p>
  This year's event will begin at 4 p.m. with a short documentary directed by Basu on Ray's Apu Trilogy: <i>Pather Panchali</i> (1955), <i>Aparajito</i> (1956), and <i>Apu Sansar</i> (1959)--which traces the life of a Bengali family and their son Apu, and which made Satyajit Ray India's first internationally recognized director. Historian Partha Mitter will then speak on "The Poetic Reality of Satyajit Ray," followed by actress Sharmila Tagore, who will give a personal perspective about her experiences working with Ray. The restored print of <i>Pather Panchali</i> will be screened at 5 p.m. Admission is free and open the public.
</p>
<p>
  Basu noted that the UCSC event will culminate a yearlong celebration of the 50th anniversary of Ray's first film.
</p>
<p>
  "We opened our anniversary celebration last December by taking author Salman Rushdie to Calcutta, where we had an exhibition of Ray's film art and a lecture by Rushdie," said Basu. "Then in May, we were invited by the Cannes Film Festival to be an official part of this year's program and launch their 'Classics' series."
</p>
<p>
  Frank Pierson, two-time Oscar-winning director and president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, accompanied Basu to the Cannes Festival, along with actress Tagore, whose film career began with Ray at the age of 14. She acted in five of Ray's films and has gone on to star in more than 150 movies in the Indian film industry known as Bollywood.
</p>
<p>
  "The restored print of <i>Pather Panchali</i> screened this past year in such places as London, Germany, Rome, New Delhi, Bangladesh, and Korea," Basu added. "We are now concluding our yearlong celebration by showing it on campus at UCSC as part of this year's Sidhartha Maitra annual lecture and screening."

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  The community is invited to attend a free public forum about the state budget crisis and its long-term impact on funding for education on Tuesday, October 25, at 4:30 p.m. in the Merrill Cultural Center at UCSC.
</p>
<p>
  Santa Cruz Superintendent of Schools Diane Siri will be joined by three panelists for the event, "Books, Budgets, Buildings: State Fiscal Crisis and Educational Equity in California." The forum is being hosted by UCSC's Center for Justice, Tolerance, and Community (CJTC).
</p>
<p>
  "We want to bring together local educators, administrators, students, and community members to talk about education, funding, and equity," said CJTC codirector Manuel Pastor, a professor of Latin American and Latino studies. "Major policy changes for education are on the ballot in the upcoming special election, but we know voters are frustrated by the initiative process. We need events like this to help inform the public about the broader issues and to develop strategies for long-term involvement."
</p>
<p>
  In addition to Siri, participants will be:
</p>
<p>
  * <strong>Jean Ross</strong>, founder and executive director of the California Budget Project, which works to improve public policies that affect the economic and social well being of low- and middle-income Californians;
</p>
<p>
  * <strong>Richard Raya</strong>, senior associate at Policy Link, who will discuss school overcrowding and make recommendations for more equitable distribution of school construction funds;
</p>
<p>
  * <strong>John Rogers</strong>, associate director of UCLA's Institute for Democracy, Education, and Access (IDEA), who will discuss efforts to make schools places of equal opportunity and democratic life.

<p>
  The David and Lucile Packard Foundation has awarded a major grant to researchers at UCSC and other institutions to study fisheries in the northern Gulf of California.
</p>
<p>
  The $1.3 million grant funds a collaborative project to help local Mexican fishers and government officials understand and manage marine resources using cutting-edge fisheries science.
</p>
<p>
  The project is an interdisciplinary effort that will combine social science, fisheries science, and outreach programs to promote the sustainability of fisheries in the Gulf of California. Peter Raimondi, professor and chair of ecology and evolutionary biology, will lead UCSC's participation in the project, along with Giacomo Bernardi and Mark Carr, both associate professors of ecology and evolutionary biology. The project also involves researchers at the University of Arizona and three Mexican institutions.
</p>
<p>
  Local fishers will play a pivotal role in the project by providing historical and anecdotal information, providing samples for scientific analysis, and participating in habitat surveys, Raimondi said.
</p>
<p>
  The Gulf of California, between the Baja peninsula and the Mexican mainland, is a remarkably rich environment. It provides vital habitat for marine mammals, seabirds, fish, and shellfish, some of which are found nowhere else in the world. It also provides a livelihood for many of the people who live along its shores.
</p>
<p>
  Local fishers, who rely on the marine resources for sustenance and income, have been hard hit by declining catches. In recent years, the Gulf of California has been plagued by overfishing and reduced freshwater flow due to diversion of the Colorado River. Many local fishers are in favor of marine reserves, restricted fishing seasons, and other measures to sustain their fisheries.
</p>
<p>
  "The attitude of the local Mexican fishers in the northern Gulf of California is very different from what you see in the United States, where many fishers resist these kinds of management strategies, especially reserves," Raimondi said.
</p>
<p>
  The local fishing industry in the northern Gulf of California is characterized by the "panga," a small open boat used by most small-scale fishers. In many cases, fishers from a single town or several small villages have formed cooperatives to protect their interests. These cooperatives are often territorial and discourage encroachment from nearby communities and larger commercial boats.
</p>
<p>
  Although local stewardship has been effective in some situations, there is no guarantee that it will work in the Gulf of California. For each type of fish or shellfish, effective management will depend on its breeding and migration habits and on local ocean currents, Raimondi said. The "PANGAS project," as it is informally known, aims to answer questions that will help local fishers and the Mexican government manage resources effectively. For example, can the locally organized fishing cooperatives hope to regulate the fisheries they rely upon, or does management need to be regional? If cooperatives protect local breeding stocks by establishing reserves, will they reap the benefits of this protection, or will the young fish go somewhere else and enrich the fisheries of their neighbors?
</p>
<p>
  "We want to be able to look at each species and tell fishers what type of management will be most effective," Raimondi said.
</p>
<p>
  In order to answer these questions, UCSC researchers will collaborate with partner institutions to learn about the habits of commercially important fish and shellfish. In addition to the University of Arizona, partners include the Centro de Investigacion Cientifica y de Educacion Superior de Ensenada (CICESE), Communidad y Biodiversidad (COBI) in Bahia Kino, and Centro Intercultural para el Estudio de los Desiertos y Oceanos (CEDO) in Puerto Penasco.
</p>
<p>
  For many of the questions addressed, the researchers will use techniques similar to those used by Raimondi, Carr, and their colleagues in a long-term monitoring project on the U.S. West Coast known as the Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans (PISCO). Ocean current data will help scientists predict where free-floating larvae will end up when they finally settle down and transition to the juvenile phase. Other techniques will provide more direct data on local fish and shellfish populations.
</p>
<p>
  Population genetics, for example, uses DNA to assess the degree of similarity between individuals of the same species. If all the mussels on one part of the coast share a sequence of DNA but mussels on a nearby section of coast do not have this sequence, researchers can conclude that the two populations are separate and usually do not interbreed. Unfortunately, the results are rarely this clear.
</p>
<p>
  "Even one or two migrants per generation can scramble genes to the extent that there is no detectable difference between populations," Raimondi said.
</p>
<p>
  More promising for the study of local populations may be an environmental sleuthing technique known as otolith microchemistry that allows scientists to look back at the migration history of an individual fish. Fish have small ear bones known as otoliths. Every day that a fish lives, it deposits a thin layer of calcium on the otolith (like the rings of a tree). The signature of the water in which the fish is living is incorporated in the calcium deposit. This signature is made up of trace elements that are present in the water (often contaminants such as lead, selenium, and barium).
</p>
<p>
  In studies along the California coast, PISCO scientists have shown that the trace elements provide a fingerprint that is unique to a small part of the coast. From otoliths, scientists can determine the age of the fish and where the fish was when each layer of calcium was laid down, Raimondi said.
</p>
<p>
  In the case of the PANGAS project, scientists will use the central (oldest) part of the otoliths to determine where a fish lived as a juvenile. If most of the fish caught by fishers in the cooperative were spawned and grew up nearby, then local management will likely be effective in protecting this population. If fish caught in one area began their lives widely scattered along the coast, however, a more regional approach to management will be needed to protect the fishery.
</p>
<p>
  For the PANGAS project, scientists from UCSC will primarily work with CICESE to collect the scientific data for the project and to conduct outreach programs to train Mexican participants in the use of scientific techniques for fisheries management. The University of Arizona will work in partnership with the two other Mexican groups to collect social information about the nature and organization of the cooperatives and the history of the fisheries. Both groups will involve the local fishers extensively in their research.
</p>
<p>
  The grant for the PANGAS project is part of a broader effort by the Packard Foundation to conserve marine richness and productivity and to contribute to the sustainability of marine and coastal economies. The ongoing PISCO project is a <a href="http://www.piscoweb.org">partnership of four major universities</a> (including UCSC) dedicated to studying the nearshore ecosystems of the U.S. West Coast from southern California to Oregon.
</p>
<p>
  The Packard Foundation funded the first six years of the PISCO project with $24 million in grants, and has now partnered with the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation to provide an additional $24.5 million over the next five years ($13.5 million from the Moore Foundation and $11 million from the Packard Foundation, of which about $7 million will go to UCSC).

<p>
  The UCSC Women's Center will observe its 20th anniversary with a celebratory luncheon, a new publication from the Regional History Project of the University Library, and an art exhibit by UCSC women staff and alumnae.
</p>
<p>
  The luncheon will take place from 10:30 to 2 p.m on Saturday, October 22, at the Women's Center, located at Cardiff House on the UCSC campus.
</p>
<p>
  Featured speakers include Santa Cruz County supervisor Mardi Wormhoudt and UCSC psychology professor Aida Hurtado, who will both speak on the topic: "Why a Women's Center?" Wormhoudt will speak from a town/gown perspective and Hurtado from an academic point of view. UCSC Chancellor Denice D. Denton will provide the opening remarks. The event is free and open to the community. For reservations, contact Roberta Valdez at (831) 459-2169.
</p>
<p>
  The Women's Center will also celebrate the publication of <i>Crossing Borders: The UCSC Women's Center, 1985-2005,</i> a new oral history from the Regional History Project of the UCSC library. Conceived of and completed especially for this anniversary, the new volume features seven interviews with narrators who address the vision, achievements, and challenges faced by the Women's Center over the past two decades.
</p>
<p>
  Two of the center's founding faculty--UCSC literature professor Helene Moglen and American studies and women's studies lecturer emerita Marge Frantz--as well as five staff women who served as directors are featured in the publication, including Kathie Olsen, Beatriz Lopez-Flores, Arlyn Osborne, Shane Snowdon, and Roberta Valdez.
</p>
<p>
  "The UCSC Women's Center was founded with a broad vision far beyond that of most academic women's centers," noted Irene Reti, director of the Regional History Project. "It has served not only students, but also staff and faculty, as well as the surrounding community."
</p>
<p>
  The Women's Center will also celebrate its anniversary with an art exhibit titled <i>Legacies,</i> running through October 28 at the Cardiff House. The show will feature photographs, paintings, sculpture, and surface design created by UCSC staff and alumnae.
</p>
<p>
  Copies of the oral history may be ordered from the Regional History Project by calling (831) 459-2847 or e-mailing <a href="mailto:ihreti@ucsc.edu">ihreti@ucsc.edu</a>. The oral history is also available online at <a href="http://library.ucsc.edu/reg-hist/index.html">http://library.ucsc.edu/reg-hist/index.html</a> or in the University Library's collection.

        <title>Seismologist to discuss great earthquakes and tsunamis on Wednesday, October 19</title>

<a name="content" id="content"></a><br>
<p>
  The December 2004 and March 2005 Sumatra earthquakes were the two largest earthquakes to occur in the past 40 years. While the human tragedy that accompanied these events is hard to comprehend, the location of these earthquakes, at a subduction zone plate boundary, is well known to generate the greatest earthquakes and tsunamis worldwide. Susan Schwartz, professor of Earth sciences and director of the Keck Seismological Laboratory, will explore the tectonic environment of subduction zone faults in a talk this week entitled "Great Earthquakes and Tsunamis: How, Why, and Where?"
</p>
<p>
  Schwartz's talk, part of the <a href="http://library.ucsc.edu/science/synergy">Science & Engineering Library's Synergy Lecture Series</a>, will take place at 4 p.m. on Wednesday, October 19, in the library's Current Periodicals Room. Light refreshments will be available.
</p>
<p>
  Schwartz will address questions of how and why great earthquakes and tsunamis occur at subduction zone faults and what factors control the mode and localization of strain release. Vast improvements in the quantity and quality of both seismic and Global Positioning System (GPS) data from subduction zones are allowing fault zones to be imaged. These images reveal a patchwork of frictional properties with a range of behaviors, from completely locked patches that will fail in large earthquakes to zones with high slip rates that are moving at the rate of the plate. Schwartz will discuss results she has obtained from the Costa Rica seismogenic zone and how that data adds to our overall knowledge of how, why, and where earthquakes occur.
</p>
<p>
  More information about the lecture series is available at the <a href="http://library.ucsc.edu/science/synergy">S&E Library's Synergy Lecture Series</a> web site or by calling (831) 459-3141.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_7517" align="alignright" width="140"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/10/young_peter.140.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7517" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/10/young_peter.140.jpg" alt="Peter Young" width="140" height="179" /></a>Peter Young[/caption]

<p>
  The Division of Physical and Biological Sciences has honored Peter Young, professor of physics, with the Outstanding Faculty Award for 2004-05. The award was made in recognition of Young's distinguished research career, teaching excellence, and commitment to service.
</p>
<p>
  Young is a fellow of the American Physical Society and corecipient of the 1985 Maxwell Medal and Prize from the Institute of Physics. In 2004, he received UCSC's Excellence in Teaching Award.
</p>
<p>
  The author of nearly 200 papers on theoretical condensed matter physics, Young studies phase transitions, with an emphasis on using numerical techniques to give a physical understanding of the problem. One area of interest is phase transitions in random systems, particularly in the highly disordered magnetic systems known as "spin glasses." The theory of quantum phase transitions is another area of interest.
</p>
<p>
  Young came to UCSC in 1984 from Imperial College London. He earned his M.A. and D.Phil. degrees from Oxford University.

<a name="content" id="content"></a><br>
<a href="mailto:srapp@ucsc.edu">Scott Rappaport</a>
<p>
  Dard Neuman has ambitious plans for promoting Indian music and culture at UCSC.
</p>
<p>
  As holder of the university's Kamil and Talat Hasan Endowed Chair in Classical Indian Music, he is responsible for building interest in Hindustani music through a variety of programs -- functioning as a combination of academic instructor, concert promoter, event coordinator, sitar teacher, fundraiser, and program manager.
</p>
<p>
  A 2004 Ph.D. from Columbia University specializing in North Indian Classical music, Neuman is also trained as a sitarist. As a dedicated musician, anthropologist, and ethnomusicologist, Neuman will work to broaden UCSC's offerings in world music as he provides critical direction for programs and courses funded by the campus's Indian music endowments.
</p>
<p>
  "We are delighted that Dard Neuman has joined us in our efforts to further the study and performance of the Indian arts at UC Santa Cruz," said Chancellor Denice D. Denton. "As our first endowed chair in Indian classical music, his appointment is a critical component of our long-range plans to create a flourishing center of South Asia studies on campus."
</p>
<p>
  Neuman noted that the UCSC endowed chair in Indian music may be the first of its kind for an American university.
</p>
<p>
  "To have a chaired position that was created solely for Hindustani music is unique in the United States," said Neuman. "I believe that UC Santa Cruz had the very first one.
</p>
<p>
  The 33-year-old Neuman comes from a long musical lineage. His father is also a musician and ethnomusicologist who has studied the anthropology of Indian music. His mother was born in India to a family of music lovers, and his aunt is a professional sitarist. Neuman was presented with a small sitar on his fifth birthday in India, and he soon began studying with his aunt.
</p>
<p>
  "I come from a background where music saturated the air," Neuman observed. "I had constant exposure to visiting artists. My grandparents were close to musicians who often played at our house when they came through town. And when my father was at Dartmouth and at the University of Washington, he would invite visiting artists and they would often stay at our place. So I couldn't help becoming obsessed with the music--either you rebel and have nothing to do with it, or it becomes part of your blood, your passion."
</p>
<p>
  Neuman has many ideas to help build the Indian music program at UCSC over the next decade. In an effort to expose students and the community to a wider range of traditional music styles, instruments, and vocal techniques, he plans to create a revolving visiting artist course to bring different musicians from India to teach at UCSC.
</p>
<p>
  He will also continue UCSC's Indian concert series and hopes to present an Indian music festival--modeled after the two- or three-day festivals in India that run all day and all night long. "In Hindustani music, there are ragas for different times of the day," Neuman noted. "And since most concerts take place in the evening we seldom hear the late or early morning ragas."
</p>
<p>
  In addition to bringing in scholars from around the world for academic conferences, Neuman also hopes to establish an archive of Indian music at UCSC. "There is a substantial collection of concert recordings dating from the 1950s and commercial recordings dating from the turn of the century," said Neuman. "An archive at UCSC would allow people to listen to a wide selection of archived music, interviews, and field recordings."
</p>
<p>
  Neuman added he would like to create a CD series where both musicians and ethnomusicologists can reflect on what's happening in selected musical recordings. He additionally envisions creating videos of renowned musicians reacting to old recordings and talking about them as a way for students to have historical material come alive. And topping his wish list, as UCSC expands its programs, is to eventually produce an equivalent for Indian music of the Ken Burns documentary on jazz.
</p>
<p>
  "It's quite exciting," said Neuman, as he described plans for the beginning sitar course he is teaching this fall quarter. "My ultimate goal is for UC Santa Cruz to become a center for Indian scholastic and performance activity in the U.S."
</p>
<p>
  <i>The opening concert of UCSC's 2005-06 Indian Classical Concert Series will take place on Saturday, October 15, featuring internationally acclaimed performer and award-winning composer Rajeev Taranath on sarod, accompanied by Abhiman Kaushal on tabla. The concert begins at 7:30 p.m. at the UCSC Music Center Recital Hall. Taranath is a recipient of the Indian government's highest award in the arts--the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award--given in recognition of outstanding achievement in the field of Hindustani instrumental music. For ticket information, contact the UCSC Ticket Office, (831) 459-2159.</i>

        <title>Joseph Miller steps down as director of UC Observatories/Lick Observatory after 14 years at the helm</title>

<a name="content" id="content"></a><br>
<a href="mailto:stephens@ucsc.edu">Tim Stephens</a>
<p>
  Joseph S. Miller has resigned as director of UC Observatories/Lick Observatory (UCO/Lick), a position he held for 14 years.
</p>
<p>
  Miller will return to full-time teaching and research at UCSC, where he is a professor of astronomy and astrophysics.
</p>
<p>
  Michael Bolte, also a professor of astronomy and astrophysics, will serve as interim director of UCO/Lick while an international search is under way to appoint a new permanent director.
</p>
<p>
  UCO/Lick, headquartered on the UCSC campus, operates the Lick Observatory on Mount Hamilton and is a managing partner of the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii. Lick Observatory, founded in 1888, was the first major mountaintop observatory and continues to be an important research site.
</p>
<p>
  When Miller became director of UCO/Lick in 1991, the Keck Observatory was just a contruction project and Lick was the only UC observatory. By 1993, the 10-meter Keck I Telescope was operational, and in 1996 it was joined by the twin Keck II Telescope. They remain the world's largest optical and infrared telescopes, and they have enabled the research of UC astronomers to flourish at an unprecedented level.
</p>
<p>
  "It has been a very eventful time," Miller said. "This job would have been impossible without the tremendous support of the excellent scientists and technical staff who make this one of the premier observatories in the world."
</p>
<p>
  UCO/Lick astronomers are now working with partner institutions on plans for a giant 30-meter telescope. The Thirty-Meter Telescope (TMT) project is currently in the design phase, funded by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation through separate $17.5 million grants to UC and the California Institute of Technology.
</p>
<p>
  "In his first 10 years as director, Joe Miller led UC astronomy into the Keck Observatory era and to the very forefront of astronomical research. In the last four years, his vision for the future has been to have UC play a leadership role in designing, building, and using the first of the next generation of extremely large telescopes. The Thirty-Meter Telescope is the realization of that vision, and this project is progressing rapidly on all design fronts," said Bolte, who cochairs the TMT science advisory committee.
</p>
<p>
  UCO/Lick has played a leading role in the development of adaptive optics, the revolutionary technology for removing the blurring effects of the atmosphere from astronomical images. The world's first laser guide star for routine adaptive optics observations was implemented on the 3-meter Shane Telescope at Lick Observatory.
</p>
<p>
  In 1999, UCO/Lick astronomers led the successful effort to establish the Center for Adaptive Optics (CfAO), a National Science Foundation Science and Technology Center headquartered at UCSC. And in 2002, a $9 million grant from the Moore Foundation enabled UCO/Lick to establish the Laboratory for Adaptive Optics at UCSC.
</p>
<p>
  Also during Miller's tenure, three major instruments for the Keck Telescopes were designed and built at the UCO/Lick Technical Laboratories at UCSC: the High Resolution Echelle Spectrometer (HIRES), the Echelle Spectrometer and Imager (ESI), and the Deep Extragalactic Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph (DEIMOS).
</p>
<p>
  "These instruments have led to many important discoveries," Miller said. "They are arguably as successful as any instruments on any large telescope in the world."
</p>
<p>
  Miller, who joined the UCSC faculty in 1967, holds the Henry Bachmann Endowed Chair for Astronomical Instrumentation. His research interests include quasars and active galactic nuclei, focusing on their relationships with the surrounding environment and the nature of their host galaxies.
</p>
<p>
  Miller was named director of UCO/Lick in 1991. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1994 and served as chair of the AURA Coordinating Council of Observatory Research Directors from 1997 to 1999. He earned his B.A. in astronomy and physics from UCLA and his M.S. and Ph.D. in astronomy from the University of Wisconsin.

  <br>
  It seems now that Bonnie Rose Hough was destined for a career in law.
</p>
<p>
  One of the first classes she took at UCSC was <i>Constitutional Law</i>. During an internship her freshman year, she visited nursing homes to identify the legal needs of senior citizens and even represented them during administrative hearings on Social Security issues.
</p>
<p>
  She worked with a local attorney on landlord-tenant law, and she interned for the ACLU in Mississippi, pitching in on death-penalty, prison-abuse, and first-amendment cases.
</p>
<p>
  Today, Hough (pronounced "Huff") is a powerful advocate for Californians who are forced to represent themselves in court because they cannot afford a lawyer. (Unlike criminal court, civil court does not provide lawyers for the poor.) Her official title is supervising attorney for the Center for Families, Children & the Courts for the Judicial Council of California. Hough administers cutting-edge programs that provide guidance to people without lawyers as they navigate their way through the complex court system.
</p>
<p>
  Hough recently received the Fay Stender Award from California Women Lawyers, the statewide women's bar association. The award is given annually to an attorney who is "committed to the representation of women, disadvantaged groups and unpopular causes, and whose courage, zest for life, and demonstrated ability to effect change as a single individual make her a role model for women attorneys."
</p>
<p>
  William C. Vickrey, administrative director of the California Courts, called Hough a "state treasure" and said she is "living proof that one person can make a difference."
</p>
<p>
  Hough has been working for social justice since college, when she reveled in the combination of classroom learning, experiential education, and analysis. After graduating with a double major in American studies and community studies, Hough earned a master's degree in public administration from San Francisco State University and then a law degree from Hastings College of the Law in 1987.
</p>
<p>
  As a law student, she helped found the Family Law Center in Marin County, a private nonprofit organization that provides low-cost legal services to the poor. Often, it is the working poor who fall between the cracks, unable to afford a private attorney but ineligible for legal aid, said Hough, who became a staff attorney and executive director after graduation.
</p>
<p>
  Though daunting, the prospect of appearing in court without an attorney is becoming commonplace. Eighty percent of the people who appear in family court in California each year have no legal representation, said Hough, now a supervising attorney with the Center for Families, Children & the Courts, an arm of the Administrative Office of the Courts (AOC) in San Francisco. Charged with improving the state court system, the AOC administers programs designed to improve the quality of justice in California.
</p>
<p>
  Hough joined the AOC in 1997 to help launch the Family Law Facilitator Program, considered the backbone of the state's self-help court programs. Court-based self-help programs are staffed by attorneys who help people understand the law and gain access to the courts. The family law facilitator program provides an attorney in each of California's 58 counties to help self-represented litigants with child and spousal support issues. Many courts have expanded those services to assist with divorce, custody, and visitation issues.
</p>
<p>
  The success of the facilitator program has spawned numerous programs, including the development of comprehensive self-help centers that provide assistance with landlord-tenant, consumer, and other issues, and offer services in Spanish and other languages. Hough has also spearheaded the development of a self-help web site with 900 pages of legal information and links to additional legal assistance.
</p>
<p>
  Unlike other states, where judges might refuse entry to anyone without an attorney, California and Maryland are at the forefront of efforts to make their courts accessible to the poor.
</p>
<p>
  "It's an amazing change in the judicial culture," said Hough. "We in California are so lucky to have a court system that cares enough to support this work. People can get to the court and can get their cases resolved."
</p>
<p>
  Hough lives in Marin County with her husband, James Pfeiffer, and their dog Max, a border collie mix with "three legs and a very big heart."
</p>
<p>
  <i>Hough, a Cowell College alumna, received her B.A. in American studies and community studies in 1983</i>.

        <title>Rising utility costs spur call for conservation</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 10 Oct 2005 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a><br>
<p>
  "Electricity and natural gas prices were rising before the recent hurricanes in the Gulf Coast," said Ilse Kolbus, director of the UCSC Physical Plant. "When you couple rate increases with increases in consumption as the campus grows, we've got a problem," she said.
</p>
<p>
  "The campus can expect to be $800,000 in deficit by the end of the year," Kolbus said. "Although the UCSC community has a very good record at conservation, we need everyone to make a significant effort to reduce their energy usage even further."
</p>
<p>
  Electricity costs are 25 percent higher than last year, and natural gas prices have climbed 24 percent, Kolbus said. Natural gas prices have a ripple effect on electricity prices since many power plants convert electricity from natural gas. "The gas market was supposed to stabilize, but it never has--it's continued to churn," Kolbus said.
</p>
<p>
  Adding to the problem for UCSC are double-digit increases in water and sewer rates.
</p>
<p>
  An upcoming energy awareness campaign will include posting building-specific consumption rates, disseminating the costs of running specific pieces of equipment, and a conservation program for students living on campus. Until those efforts get under way, the Physical Plant is offering several suggestions to help reduce energy consumption immediately, including:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>* Eliminate the use of space heaters</strong>. Each one uses one kilowatt of power per hour. Flat panel leg warmers or foot warmers can be substituted and use far less energy (approximately 100 watts). These will soon be available for purchase from Physical Plant shop stores at a reduced rate of approximately $50. Better yet, in cold weather, dress warmly and in layers that can be adjusted for optimal comfort.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>* Keep thermostats down.</strong> Where thermostats are not centrally controlled, maintain a maximum of 68 degrees or below for heating, and a minimum of 78 degrees or above for cooling. (This includes all computer/server areas on campus, except where required by the equipment manufacturer or where specific research needs can be demonstrated.)
</p>
<p>
  <strong>* Keep use of electrical appliances to a minimum</strong>. For example, after brewing coffee, place the remainder in a thermal decanter and turn off the coffee pot. Unplug water coolers that heat or cool water. Use microwave ovens instead of hotplates for heating water. All appliances should be turned off when not needed.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>* Turn off unused and unnecessary lighting.</strong> When you leave a room, turn off the lights. Everyone should be involved in turning off lights that have been left on and are not needed. If lights in your area have faulty occupancy sensors, call the work order desk at (831) 459-4444 and a lighting technician can remedy the problem, saving energy and providing a more comfortable work environment.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>* Rethink your lighting needs.</strong> If your location has windows, assess how well natural light will work for you. If possible, use task lighting and turn off overhead lights. "Delamping" can save energy and improve glare on computer monitors. If overhead lights are more than what's needed, Physical Plant electricians can remove unneeded lamps to achieve the desired effect. Units should give a broad assessment of areas to be delamped to prevent multiple call-outs for electricians to re-lamp. While keeping exit safety in mind, hallway lighting should be kept to a minimum.
</p>
<p>
  * <strong>Turn off office equipment that is not being used</strong>, such as printers and copiers. (It is unnecessary to turn off new equipment that is DOE Energy Star certified, as these units have been designed to significantly reduce energy consumption during periods of inactivity). At the conclusion of the workday, shut down office and other equipment for the evening.
</p>
<p>
  * <strong>Turn off computers when not in use.</strong> Computing equipment draws roughly one-third the electricity used in a typical office. Disable screen saver programs that draw pictures on idle computers and instead enable the energy or power management control panel to turn off the screen after a brief period of inactivity. At the end of the workday, shut down unused computers <i>and</i> switch off their outlet strips; this will save the 9-16 watts they consume even while off. Adopt systems that don't require computers to be left on all the time. Use laptop computers instead of desktop computers whenever possible since they draw 80-90 percent less energy and accomplish the same tasks. The ergonomic problems of laptops can be solved with simple stands and an external keyboard and mouse. Computer labs should be completely dark and switched off when closed. Purchasing decisions for computer equipment should consider their energy demands; monitors in particular have widely differing electricity consumption for similar products.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>* Consider replacing and consolidating refrigerators</strong>. Small refrigerators carry a significant load. Units should consider replacing older or outdated models with a larger energy-efficient refrigerator
</p>
<p>
  <strong>* Keep fume hood sashes closed whenever possible in laboratories</strong>. This reduces the load on building exhaust fans and supply fans considerably.

  By <a href="mailto:ldonahue@ucsc.edu">Louise Donahue</a>
</p>
<p>
  Out-of-control student parties in residential areas affect both the campus and the community. So what could be more logical than putting together a coalition of students and campus and community leaders to tackle the problem?
</p>
<p>
  The new coalition, called Campus CURB--Community United to Reduce Bingeing--unveiled its plans at an October 6 press conference at the <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/healthcenter/">Student Health Center.</a>
</p>
<p>
  The coalition will conduct awareness campaigns and support the new Santa Cruz ordinance that imposes stiff fines on those whose parties repeatedly require police attention.
</p>
<p>
  And while the problems caused by excessive drinking can be serious, the coalition has decided against a heavy-handed approach. One of the coalition's first campaigns, an effort to encourage party hosts and guests to act responsibly, is called "Just Say Gnome: Party Small."
</p>
<p>
  Chancellor Denice D. Denton and other UCSC administrators were joined at the press conference by Santa Cruz mayor and UCSC lecturer Michael Rotkin; June Coha of West Side Neighbors; a student residential assistant; and three students from the Student Health Outreach and Promotion (<a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/healthcenter/health_promotions/health_promotions.htm">SHOP</a>) program at the Health Center.
</p>
<p>
  Chancellor Denton emphasized that those hosting large, loud parties do not represent the typical UCSC student. "I'm very proud of our students," she said, adding that, unfortunately, "even a few individuals can create an impact, not only in our campus, but in our community."
</p>
<p>
  "This is a national issue. It's been around for a long time," she said, citing some of the problems caused by excessive drinking, such as auto accidents and the increased likelihood of date rape and other assaults. The chancellor endorsed the efforts of the campus and the city of Santa Cruz to bring the problem under control.
</p>
<p>
  Mayor Rotkin and others praised the coalition for pinpointing the problem of excessive drinking, rather than taking a prohibitionist approach to all drinking. "Moderate and responsible drinking is not the cause of problems in our society," he said. Modeling one of the "Just Say Gnome" t-shirts displayed at the press conference, Rotkin explained that the new city ordinance is designed to put an end to the most excessive partying--the kind that requires the attention of several police officers. "It's not for the party that's a little too loud."
</p>
<p>
  Neighborhood activist Coha echoed Rotkin's view that the new ordinance would be used rarely. "Good neighbors are not against parties. We need to all work together."
</p>
<p>
  UCSC and Santa Cruz police were also represented at the event. The Santa Cruz Police Department has formed partnership agreements with the UCSC Police, so off-campus party violations can have on-campus consequences.
</p>
<p>
  The student members of the coalition are playing a major role in guiding the awareness campaign, said Jane Bogart, coordinator of SHOP. The gnome concept stemmed from discussions with students on campus, who said they prefer to go to smaller parties.
</p>
<p>
  Student residential assistant Edgar Nunez said he has gotten a good reaction to wearing his "Just Say Gnome" t-shirt. "Everyone was super receptive. Everyone wanted the cool t-shirt," he said.
</p>
<p>
  Tips on holding a safe and legal party are included in a "Just Say Gnome" bochure available at the press conference, which included Health Center staff member Eleanor Gillis in a gnome costume. Copies of the brochure will be available in the SHOP office in the basement of the Health Center.
</p>
<p>
  Campus CURB will also be monitoring actions by police, including DUI enforcement, party patrols to disperse unruly crowds, and enforcement of laws prohibiting alcohol sales to minors. The resulting data will help to evaluate and develop science-based prevention strategies.
</p>

        <title>More than 500,000 new businesses launched each month, economist's study says</title>

<p>
  <strong><br>
  Immigrants, Latinos show strong start-up activity; African American rate low, but increasing</strong>
</p>
<p>
  More than half a million new businesses are started each month, according to a new national assessment of entrepreneurial activity developed by UCSC economist Robert Fairlie.
</p>
<p>
  The number of businesses started by immigrants and Latinos shows strong start-up activity, and the rate for African Americans is growing, according to the Kauffman Index of Entrepreneurial Activity, launched by the Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation.
</p>
<p>
  The Kauffman Index is the first study to measure business start-up activity for the entire U.S. adult population at the individual owner level. The data are derived from the monthly Current Population Survey (CPS), a national population survey conducted by the U.S. Bureau of the Census and the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
</p>
<p>
  Two especially surprising findings from the study are that the Latino rate of entrepreneurship increased from 0.38 percent in 1996 to 0.48 percent in 2004, which was higher than the white, non-Latino rate of 0.39 percent, and that immigrants have substantially higher rates of entrepreneurship than native-born individuals. The average rate of entrepreneurship for immigrants was 0.46 percent compared with 0.35 percent for the native-born.
</p>
<p>
  Over the period from 1996 to 2004, an average of 0.36 percent of the adult population created a new business each month, representing approximately 550,000 new businesses per month, according to the Kauffman Index. The rate of overall entrepreneurship activity remained relatively constant over the period despite major changes in the economy, with the rate of business creation generally between 0.3 and 0.4 percent. The average rate of entrepreneurship was 0.36 percent in 1996, 0.35 percent in 2001, and rose to 0.4 percent in 2004. It is too early, however, to know whether the recent increase in entrepreneurship is due to cyclical or structural factors.
</p>
<p>
  "Although research on entrepreneurship is growing rapidly, there are very few large national datasets other than the Kauffman Index of Entrepreneurial Activity that provide information on recent trends in entrepreneurial business creation," said Fairlie, an associate professor of economics.
</p>
<p>
  Unlike other studies that capture young businesses that are more than a year old, the Kauffman Index captures all adults 20-64 who initially start a business, including those who own incorporated or unincorporated businesses and those who are employers and nonemployers. The Kauffman Index, which is defined as the percentage of the adult U.S. population of nonbusiness owners who start a business as their main job each month, will be conducted annually.
</p>
<p>
  Among the other findings:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Entrepreneurship activity is substantially higher among men than among women. From 1996 to 2004, the average rate of entrepreneurship for men was 0.46 percent and the average rate for women was only 0.28 percent.<br>
  </li>
  <li>The rate of entrepreneurship increased in the early 2000s for men, but not for women. The male entrepreneurship rate was 0.43 percent in 2001 and rose to 0.50 percent in 2002.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Entrepreneurship activity is much lower for African Americans than other ethnic/racial groups; however, rates appear to be increasing. The average rate of entrepreneurship for blacks was 0.29 percent in 1996 and 0.35 percent in 2004.<br>
  </li>
  <li>New entrepreneurship activity is highest in the West. Other regions have similar rates of entrepreneurship.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Entrepreneurship activity increased the most in the West and South in the past few years. The entrepreneurship rate in the West increased from 0.42 percent in 2001 to 0.49 percent in 2004, and the entrepreneurship rate in the South increased from 0.35 percent to 0.41 percent.<br>
  </li>
  <li>The construction industry has the highest rate of entrepreneurship of all major industry groups.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The Kauffman Index differs from the recently released 2002 Survey of Business Owners (SBO) conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau in several major ways. First, it is based on household survey data and measures individual business owners. The SBO includes all firms operating during 2002 that filed tax forms as individual proprietorships, partnerships, and any type of corporation.
</p>
<p>
  Second, the Kauffman Index captures business entry, whereas the SBO captures numbers of existing businesses. Increases in the number of existing businesses over time may be a result of more business creation, less business closure, or a combination of the two.
</p>
<p>
  Third, the Kauffman Index only includes individuals starting businesses as their main work activity with a substantial hours commitment. The SBO includes all firms with receipts of $1,000 or more, which may include side or "casual" businesses owned by wage/salary workers, the unemployed, or retired workers. Finally, the Kauffman Index includes all new business owners, whereas the SBO excludes agricultural and a few other types of businesses.
</p>
<p>
  The Ewing Marion Kauffman Foundation of Kansas City <a href="http://www.kauffman.org">www.kauffman.org</a> is a private, nonpartisan foundation that works with partners to advance entrepreneurship in America and improve the education of children and youth. The Kauffman Foundation was established in the mid-1960s by the late entrepreneur and philanthropist Ewing Marion Kauffman.

<p>
  UCSC's McHenry Library presents "New Work from Moving Parts Press: <i>COSMOGONIE INTIME</i>," an exhibit running through December 8 at Special Collections. A reception will be held on December 3, from 2 to 4 p.m.
</p>
<p>
  The exhibit features <i>COSMOGONIE INTIME</i>, a newly published, limited-edition, bilingual collaborative book of art featuring French poet Yves Peyre, visual artist Ray Rice, translator Elizabeth R. Jackson, and award-winning book artist Felicia Rice, who founded Moving Parts Press in 1977. Paintings by Ray Rice will also be on display.
</p>
<p>
  A painter, mosaicist, and animator of experimental films, Rice died in 2001 at the age of 85. His animated art films are part of UCSC's Special Collections archive. Rice contributed 17 pen-and-ink drawings as well as hand-painted the bastard title, or half-title, in all 96 copies of the book. Twelve deluxe copies were completely hand-painted by Rice, whom renowned French contemporary poet Peyre personally selected to contribute the visual art for the five intimate, universal poems that form the collection. The paintings that inspired Peyre to choose Rice are part of the Special Collections exhibit.
</p>
<p>
  Book artist, publisher, and educator Felicia Rice has been a letterpress printer in Santa Cruz since 1973. Her books are housed in collections that range from the Whitney Museum in New York to the Victoria & Albert Museum in London. She is currently the program manager of the Digital Arts and New Media M.F.A. Program at UCSC.

        <title>Music professor honored in Korean-American competition</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 10 Oct 2005 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>

        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  A piece by music professor David Evan Jones, <i>Eemulnori: Memory and Reflection</i> for violin and piano--was selected as one of six winning compositions in the Korean-American Music Composition Competition.
</p>
<p>
  The winning compositions will be used in upcoming performance competitions by young Korean students of classical music. The ultimate goal is to disseminate Korean cultural heritage to younger generations growing up in the United States. Composers are invited to submit original pieces incorporating traditional Korean themes--written for Western musical instruments and suitable for student performers.
</p>
<p>
  Jones is a composer of instrumental, vocal, and electronic music and a theorist writing about relationships between phonetics and music. His first chamber opera, <i>Bardos</i>, was staged in Seoul by the Seoul Contemporary Opera Company in 2004, and he is currently at work on his third opera.
</p>
<p>
  Jones was recently invited to contribute to a festschrift for Korean composer Sung Jae Lee, a professor emeritus of Seoul National University. A festschrift is a complimentary publication, often symbolizing the results of research, which is created in honor of a person on the occasion of an anniversary celebration. In honor of Lee's 80th birthday, Jones composed a musical composition in the shape of the characters of Lee's name.

<p>
  American studies professor <b>Tricia Rose</b> appeared as a guest on a special broadcast of National Public Radio's <i>Talk of the Nation</i> program about race, poverty and Hurricane Katrina.
</p>
<p>
  Literature professor <b>Paul Skenazy</b> contributed five brief book reviews to the <i>Washington Post.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>USA Today</i>, the <i>Wall Street Journal,</i> and many other newspapers picked up a story about economist <strong>Rob Fairlie's</strong> latest study, which found that U.S. entrepreneurs launch an average of about 550,000 new businesses each month and that start-up growth has been steady over the past decade. <i>CNNMoney.com</i> also picked up the story.
</p>
<p>
  History professor <strong>Dana Frank</strong> was quoted in the <i>Ventura County Star</i> about what it really means to buy American, noting that "trade policy, not consumer demand, drives global commerce" as it creates job losses and closed plants, and hurts workers while boosting corporate bottom lines.

<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  <br>
  <strong>Popular Santa Cruz tourist attraction isn't so mysterious, after all</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Tourists flock to the Mystery Spot to enjoy the "puzzling variations in gravity, perspective, height and more," leaving baffled and perplexed by the apparent exceptions to the laws of physics and gravity.
</p>
<p>
  But for Bridgeman, the site is a powerful--and entertaining--way to demonstrate the influence of the visual context on perception. "It shows that you can teach serious science in unexpected places," said Bridgeman, who has published a scholarly article that explains the perceptual effects at work at the Mystery Spot. His article, "Influence of Visually Induced Expectation on Perceived Motor Effort: A Visual-Proprioceptive Interaction at the Santa Cruz Mystery Spot," appears in the June issue of <i><a href="http://www.psychonomic.org/PBR/contents.htm">Psychonomic Bulletin and Review</a></i>.
</p>
<p>
  Mystery Spot visitors will recognize the scene of Bridgeman's research: In a cabin on a steep hillside, an 8 kilogram weight hangs on a chain from the ceiling. Although the weight hangs vertically, the tilt of the cabin makes the weight appear to be suspended at an angle. Visitors find that pushing the weight one way is perceived as much more difficult than pushing it the other way. Rather than a magical defiance of gravity, the explanation lies in the "mismatch" between expectations and the actual weight: Expectations based on visual information override the proprioceptive experience of moving the weight. (Often referred to as the sixth sense, proprioception is an unconscious aspect of the sensory system that provides information essential to movement.)
</p>
<p>
  Far from spoiling the fun, Bridgeman said understanding the phenomenon adds to the enjoyment of a visit to the Mystery Spot. "To me, it's much more fun to have something that's real than not," said Bridgeman. "The real fun is that you can learn about how your mind works in an interesting setting." Mystery Spot managers welcomed the experiment, he added.
</p>
<p>
  In the study, seven subjects pushed the pendulum away from vertical in both directions and were asked to judge the required effort on a one-to-10 scale, with one described as "effortless" and 10 "immovable." All participants experienced the "effort illusion": perceived effort in pushing toward visual vertical was significantly greater than perceived effort in pushing away from visual vertical.
</p>
<p>
  "The tilt of the cabin makes it appear that the pendulum is suspended in an impossible position," said Bridgeman. "It is as though some additional force holds the weight in this unstable position. That's why the visual illusion is so compelling, and why the expected force applied is so dramatically different from the actual force needed to move the weight." Pushing the weight toward what appears to be vertical will always require more force than expected, and pushing it away will always require less.
</p>
<p>
  "The visual context strongly influences what you perceive, and you can't escape it, even if you know better," said Bridgeman. "Expectations and assumptions are as important to perceived weight as the actual effort required to move objects."
</p>
<p>
  And what does the professor hope students take away from their visit to the Mystery Spot?
</p>
<p>
  "We think of our perceptions as being pretty much accurate, but they seldom are," said Bridgeman, noting that people are notoriously inaccurate when they attempt to estimate things like distance and the slope of a hill, too. "The philosophy of the brain is not to be totally accurate but to reduce the chance of error. Perception in the service of action is error reduction."
</p>
<p>
  In other words, he said, "We're wrong, but we're right enough to get us there."

<p>
  October 3 , 2005
</p><br>
<a href="mailto:jmcnulty@ucsc.edu">Jennifer McNulty</a>
<p>
  Ellen Moir, executive director of the UCSC New Teacher Center, received the 2005 Harold W. McGraw Jr. Prize in Education in Septemberfor her pioneering work in new teacher professional development.
</p>
<p>
  Also receiving the McGraw Prize this year were Barbara Taylor Bowman, cofounder of the Erikson Institute, and Sharon Lynn Kagan, Marx Professor of Early Childhood and Family Policy and associate dean for policy at Columbia Teachers College. Recipients, selected by a board of judges from a selection of nominees, receive a $25,000 award and a commemorative statuette. Past honorees include former First Lady Barbara Bush, former Governor James B. Hunt Jr., and former U.S. Secretaries of Education Richard Riley and Rod Paige.
</p>
<p>
  Moir was recognized for her leadership in the field of teacher induction and her development of a mentoring program that pairs novice teachers with veteran classroom instructors. Moir's mentoring model dramatically improves the retention rate of new teachers. Nationally, the dropout rate among new teachers is 50 percent after five years, compared to retention rates as high as 88 percent among participants in the New Teacher Center's mentoring programs.
</p>
<p>
  "Support early in their career makes all the difference for new teachers, and we know that teacher quality is the single most important factor in student success," said Moir, a passionate advocate for equitable learning opportunities for all students.<br>
  <br>
  Moir is the founding director of the New Teacher Center, which has become a national resource for new teacher training since opening its doors in 1998. The center focuses on improving student performance by increasing teacher retention and effectiveness.
</p>
<p>
  Moir has also served 17 years as director of the Santa Cruz New Teacher Project, a beginning teacher induction program that has supported more than 10,000 beginning teachers during the first two years of their careers. From 1995 to 2000, she was the director of teacher education at UCSC. Moir frequently addresses educators and policymakers on topics related to new teacher development. In 2003, she received the California Council on Teacher Education Distinguished Teacher Educator Award.

<p>
  As part of the LRDP process, UCSC is planning to release the Draft 2005 LRDP Environmental Impact Report (EIR) in mid-October for public review. The Draft EIR will assess the potential environmental effects related to the implementation of the Draft 2005 LRDP.
</p>
<p>
  To date, UCSC has hosted five public LRDP meetings and three public EIR "scoping" sessions. But there is still time to participate.

<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  University of New Orleans researcher Stephen Winters-Hilt is still struggling to get his life back to normal and his lab up and running again in the aftermath of hurricanes Katrina and Rita.
</p>
<p>
  Thanks to his strong ties to UCSC, however, about half of the students in his research lab have temporarily relocated to this campus and will be able to carry on their research here.
</p>
<p>
  The students--four graduate students and one undergraduate--are living in campus housing, taking classes, and doing research in the UCSC Biophysics Laboratory. (Five UNO graduate students came to UCSC initially, but one of them has since returned to Louisiana, where he has family.)
</p>
<p>
  Winters-Hilt earned his Ph.D. in bioinformatics at UCSC in 2003. As a graduate student, he contributed to a research project led by David Deamer, professor of chemistry and biochemistry and interim chair of biomolecular engineering, and Mark Akeson, associate adjunct professor of biomolecular engineering. The collaboration continued after Winters-Hilt left UCSC, and he is currently a coinvestigator with Deamer and Akeson on two grants funded by the National Institutes of Health.
</p>
<p>
  Akeson tried to contact Winters-Hilt shortly after hurricane Katrina hit. When he finally got in touch, Akeson learned that Winters-Hilt's research facilities in New Orleans were out of commission. More disturbing, however, was the plight of his students.
</p>
<p>
  "The students had been living in a part of New Orleans that was badly flooded, and they needed a place to go for fall quarter," Akeson said.
</p>
<p>
  Akeson contacted Lisa Sloan, vice provost and dean of graduate studies, who worked with campus staff and administrators to get the students enrolled and arrange on-campus housing and other support for them.
</p>
<p>
  "Some of these students have lost everything, and I just hope they are able to settle in and feel they are part of the community here," Sloan said.
</p>
<p>
  Iftekhar Amin, a senior in computer science, left New Orleans in a minivan crowded with relatives and friends. He had some spare clothes in a plastic bag and not much else. They weathered the storm in Hattiesburg, Miss., where wind speeds reached 120 miles per hour, and eventually ended up in Houston. From there, Amin was able to get in touch with Winters-Hilt and found out about the possibility of coming to UCSC.
</p>
<p>
  "It's excellent here. People have been really helpful," he said.
</p>
<p>
  Amin doesn't know if he has anything left in New Orleans. He went back at one point, but was unable to get to the part of the city where he had lived. "It was still under water, but what I saw looked horrible," he said.
</p>
<p>
  Maria Tanase, a graduate student in physics, said her life still feels very unsettled, but she is glad to be in Santa Cruz. She and her husband, also a graduate student in Winters-Hilt's lab, left most of their possessions behind when they evacuated from New Orleans. A levy broke near where they had been living on the UNO campus, but they don't know the full extent of the damage.
</p>
<p>
  They are grateful for the opportunity to continue the research they had been doing in New Orleans, Tanase said. The project involves the analysis of DNA and other biological molecules using a nanopore detector--an instrument built around a tiny pore just big enough to allow a single strand of DNA to pass through. The idea for the nanopore detector originated with Deamer and a collaborator at Harvard University (see <a href="http://currents.ucsc.edu/05-06/08-22/genome.asp">earlier story</a>).
</p>
<p>
  "As far as our research is concerned, this is a great experience for us. As for the rest, well, at least we are healthy," Tanase said.
</p>
<p>
  The Department of Biomolecular Engineering has provided computers and desk space for the new students. Deamer said it won't be difficult to fit the new arrivals into the ongoing lab work on the nanopore project here at UCSC.
</p>
<p>
  "I think everybody's going to come out ahead. They will all have jobs to do here, and we will benefit from their contributions," he said.
</p>
<p>
  The University of New Orleans, meanwhile, has temporarily moved its operations to Baton Rouge. Winters-Hilt plans to offer a course out of Baton Rouge that his students can take via the Internet. He also plans to spend about one week in Santa Cruz every month, Akeson said.
</p>
<p>
  "We're just trying to make something good come out of a disaster," Akeson said.

<p>
  With toe-tappin' music, hay rides, pumpkin painting, and delectable edibles, the annual UCSC Harvest Festival is always a great way to celebrate the changing of the seasons.
</p>
<p>
  This year's festivities take place Saturday, October 8, from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. at the UCSC Farm.
</p>
<p>
  Admission is free for kids 12 and under and for members of the Friends of the UCSC Farm & Garden; adult admission is $5; UCSC students pay $3 with ID.

<p>
  According to the prevailing "cold dark matter" theory of the evolution of the universe, every galaxy is surrounded by a halo of dark matter that can only be detected indirectly by observing its gravitational effects.
</p>
<p>
  This theory faced a challenge in 2003, when a team of astronomers reported a surprising absence of dark matter in elliptical galaxies.
</p>
<p>
  But a new analysis by UCSC researchers and others in the September 29 issue of the journal <i>Nature</i> provides an explanation for the earlier observations that fits comfortably with the standard theory and puts the dark matter back into elliptical galaxies.
</p>
<p>
  "These are very normal, nearby elliptical galaxies that they studied, and if those galaxies don't have dark matter it calls into question the whole theory of cold dark matter," said Joel Primack, professor of physics and a coauthor of the <i>Nature</i> paper.
</p>
<p>
  "A dearth of dark matter in elliptical galaxies is especially puzzling in the context of the standard theory of galaxy formation, which assumes that ellipticals originate from mergers of disk galaxies," added Avishai Dekel, professor of physics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and first author of the <i>Nature</i> paper.
</p>
<p>
  "Massive dark matter halos are clearly detected in disk galaxies, so where did they disappear to during the mergers?" said Dekel, currently a visiting researcher at UCSC.
</p>
<p>
  Primack, one of the originators and developers of the cold dark matter theory, uses supercomputers to run simulations of galaxy formation and the evolution of structure in the universe. The new paper used simulations of galaxy mergers run last year by Thomas J. Cox, then a graduate student working with Primack at UCSC and now a postdoctoral researcher at Harvard University.
</p>
<p>
  The simulations show that the observations reported in 2003 are a predictable consequence of the violent galactic mergers that give rise to elliptical galaxies, Primack said. The simulations were analyzed by Dekel, Felix Stoehr, and Gary Mamon at the Institute of Astrophysics in Paris, where Dekel holds a Blaise Pascal International Chair. UCSC graduate student Greg Novak also contributed to the analysis.
</p>
<p>
  Elliptical galaxies are thought to form when two spiral galaxies collide and merge. Whereas spiral galaxies are dominated by flattened, rotating disks of stars and gas, elliptical galaxies are round, smooth collections of stars.
</p>
<p>
  Evidence for dark matter halos around spiral galaxies comes from studying the circular motions of stars in these galaxies. Because most of the visible mass in a galaxy is concentrated in the central region, stars at great distances from the center would be expected to move more slowly than stars closer in. Instead, careful observations of spiral galaxies show that the rotational speed of stars in the outskirts of the disk remains constant as far out as astronomers can measure it.
</p>
<p>
  The reason for this, according to cold dark matter theory, is the presence of an enormous halo of unseen dark matter surrounding the galaxy and exerting its gravitational influence on the stars. Additional support for dark matter halos has come from a variety of other observations.
</p>
<p>
  In elliptical galaxies, however, it has been difficult to study the motions of stars at great distances from the center. The 2003 study (A. J. Romanowsky et al., <i>Science</i> 301:1696-1698) focused on bright planetary nebulas in the outer parts of four nearby elliptical galaxies. Planetary nebulas are old stars that have blown off their outer layers and glow brightly in characteristic wavelengths of light. The researchers were able to determine the line-of-sight velocities of large numbers of planetary nebulas in these elliptical galaxies. They found a decrease in the velocities with increasing distance from the center of the galaxy, which is inconsistent with simple models of the gravitational effects of dark matter halos.
</p>
<p>
  Part of the explanation put forth in the new <i>Nature</i> paper lies in the fact that the velocities were measured along the line of sight. "You cannot measure the absolute speeds of the stars, but you can measure their relative speeds along the line of sight, because if a star is moving toward us its light is shifted to shorter wavelengths, and if it is moving away from us its light is shifted to longer wavelengths," Primack explained.
</p>
<p>
  This limitation would not be a problem if the orbits of the observed stars were randomly oriented with respect to the line of sight, because any differences resulting from the orientations of the orbits would average out over a large number of observations. According to Cox's simulations, however, the stars farthest from the center of the galaxy at any given time are likely to be moving in elongated, eccentric orbits such that most of their motion is perpendicular to the line of sight. Therefore, they could be moving at high velocities without exhibiting much motion toward or away from the observers.
</p>
<p>
  To understand why, it is necessary to look at what happens to the stars during galaxy mergers. As the merging galaxies interact, the stars themselves do not collide because they are separated by great distances, so the two galaxies essentially pass through one another. But the huge gravitational fields of the galaxies cause powerful tidal disturbances. Some of the stars are flung outward in extended tidal tails as the cores of the galaxies pass close by one another and spin apart. Sometimes the cores remain connected by a tidal bridge of stars and gas. Eventually, gravity pulls the cores back together, and the stars that were flung outward fall back in toward the center.
</p>
<p>
  "In the merger process that produces these galaxies, a lot of the stars get flung out to fairly large distances, and they end up in highly elongated orbits that take them far away and then back in close to the center," Primack said.
</p>
<p>
  To an observer outside the galaxy, a star on such an elongated orbit would only appear to be far from the galactic center if the long axis of its orbit is more or less perpendicular to the observer's line of sight. If the long axis of the orbit is aligned with the line of sight, the star would always appear to be in the crowded center of the galaxy from the perspective of the observer.
</p>
<p>
  "If we see a star at a large distance from the center of the galaxy, that star is going to be mostly moving either away from the center or back toward the center. Almost certainly, most of its motion is perpendicular to our line of sight," Primack said.
</p>
<p>
  The simulated mergers involved typical spiral galaxies, each embedded in a halo of cold dark matter. The simulations followed the gravitational and hydrodynamic evolution of the merger systems, taking into account the complicated feedbacks from star formation, supernovae, and the heating and cooling of gases in the galaxies. Each simulation was then "observed" from three different directions and at two slightly different times after the merger.
</p>
<p>
  From more than 200 merger simulations run by Cox on a supercomputer at UCSC, the researchers analyzed 10 mergers that yielded elliptical galaxies with masses similar to those of the galaxies observed in 2003. The results were completely consistent with the reported observations, Primack said.
</p>
<p>
  "Our conclusion is that what they saw is exactly what the cold dark matter model would predict," he said. "Their data are great, and this actually gives us more insight into how elliptical galaxies form."
</p>
<p>
  "We predict that other velocity tracers in the same elliptical galaxies will show higher velocities if they are less concentrated toward the galaxy center or if they move on more circular orbits," Dekel said. "This is likely to be the case for compact star clusters, which are also observable in the outskirts of elliptical galaxies."

        <title>Intitiative targets excessive drinking</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a><br>
<a href="mailto:ldonahue@ucsc.edu">Louise Donahue</a>
<p>
  <a name="OLE_LINK11" id="OLE_LINK11">A new campus-community initiative to reduce the consequences of excessive, high-risk drinking and create a safer environment for students and their neighbors is under way.</a>
</p>
<p>
  Called Campus CURB, for Campus and Community United to Reduce Bingeing, the effort is a collaboration among UCSC's Student Health Outreach and Promotion office, other UCSC offices, and members of the community.
</p>
<p>
  This fall, CURB will launch the campaign "Just Say Gnome: Party Small," and work to combat binge drinking on multiple levels, A key effort will be an awareness campaign about the new city ordinance in Santa Cruz targeting out-of-control parties. Tips on hosting parties that do not include excessive drinking will also be widely distributed to students.
</p>
<p>
  The campuswide Good Neighbor Initiative and CURB will combine forces on alcohol-related issues. The student interns of the Good Neighbor Initiative work with students and neighborhood leaders to ease town-gown tensions, and have developed a set of Good Neighbor Guidelines. (See <a href="http://currents.ucsc.edu/04-05/04-25/neighbors.asp">earlier article</a> in <i>Currents.)</i>
</p>
<p>
  Parents of UCSC students are another part of the effort. A letter has been sent out urging them to talk about alcohol and other drug use with their sons and daughters attending UCSC.
</p>
<p>
  Law enforcement agencies both on the campus and in the community will also be enlisted to conduct Drinking Under the Influence checkpoints and other actions.
</p>
<p>
  Additional details on the program will be announced soon, and covered in <i>Currents Online.</i>
</p>
<p>

        <title>Psychology professor Faye Crosby receives top national honor</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 03 Oct 2005 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_7468" align="alignright" width="160"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/10/crosby_faye.05-10-03.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7468" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/10/crosby_faye.05-10-03.jpg" alt="Faye Crosby Photo: UCSC Photo Services" width="160" height="217" /></a>Faye Crosby Photo: UCSC Photo Services[/caption]
<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  <strong>Crosby is third UCSC professor to receive national honor</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Faye J. Crosby, professor of psychology and an expert on affirmative action, has received the Kurt Lewin Award, one of the most prestigious honors in social psychology.
</p>
<p>
  Crosby received the award from the Society for the Psychological Study of Social Issues (SPSSI), also known as Division 9 of the American Psychological Association, a nonprofit organization of psychologists and social scientists that supports research on the psychological aspects of social issues.
</p>
<p>
  Named for the late Kurt Lewin, the founder of social psychology, the Lewin Award is presented annually to recognize "outstanding contributions to the development and integration of psychological research and social action."
</p>
<p>
  Crosby is a leading authority on affirmative action and diversity issues in education and business. Her most recent book is <i>Affirmative Action is Dead: Long Live Affirmative Action</i>. Among her many volumes is <i>Psychology and Management of Workplace Diversity</i>, which she coedited with Peg Stockdale.
</p>
<p>
  Specializing in social justice, Crosby has focused on individual attitudes in the context of social change. She discovered the phenomenon known as "the denial of personal disadvantage," whereby people see themselves as exempt from the injustices that affect groups with which they identify. Crosby came to UCSC in 1997 from Smith College. She was on the faculty at Yale University from 1977 to 1985.
</p>
<p>
  Crosby is the third UCSC psychology professor to receive the Kurt Lewin Award. M. Brewster Smith received the award in 1986, and Thomas Pettigrew received the honor in 1987. Crosby's award was presented during the annual meeting of the American Psychological Association in August.
</p>
<p>
  "Professor Crosby has made major contributions to contemporary scholarship, and her research accomplishments are matched by her excellence as a teacher," said UCSC Chancellor Denice D. Denton. "She is in good company, joining her UCSC colleagues Brewster Smith and Tom Pettigrew."
</p>
<p>
  Crosby also received the Distinguished Publication Award from the Association for Women in Psychology for coediting a special issue of the <i>Journal of Social Issues</i> called "The Maternal Wall" that focused on work-family balance. Crosby received the same award last year for an article she coauthored with two UCSC graduate students and a colleague from the College of Wooster, entitled "Affirmative Action: Psychological Data and the Policy Debates."
</p>
<p>
  She is currently chair of the UCSC Academic Senate. "I'm happy to work hard for the community of UCSC scholars because UCSC is such a fantastic school filled with people who combine excellent research with outstanding teaching," said Crosby. "And here we really do achieve excellence through diversity."

        <title>Chancellor Denton to be a celeb caller at spelling bee fundraiser for Santa Cruz Boys & Girls Club</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 03 Oct 2005 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a><br>
<br>
<p>
  The Boys & Girls Club of Santa Cruz is sponsoring a community-wide adult spelling bee on Sunday, October 16, from 2-5 p.m. at the Boys & Girls Club. The bee will raise money for the club's educational, civic, music, sports, and entrepreneurial programs for youth 7 to 18 years of age, as well as the club's expansion to Live Oak and Watsonville.
</p>
<p>
  Local celebrity callers--including Chancellor Denice D. Denton, Santa Cruz Mayor Mike Rotkin, and Cabrillo College President Brian King--will pronounce the words.
</p>
<p>
  Teams of three spellers will be challenged by words from the official Scripps Howard Bee Book--words as easy as "comet," and as arcane as "kamelaukion" (which are high hats worn by priests of Eastern rites). Fortunately for all, the spelling list is available for study upon receipt of entry.
</p>
<p>
  The first-place team will receive $500 to give to the nonprofit(s) of their choice in Santa Cruz County, as well as trophies and bragging rights. The second place team will receive trophies.
</p>
<p>
  To enter, each team must contribute/raise at least $400. All contributions are tax deductible. <a href="http://www.boysandgirlsclub.info/">Application forms</a> are available on the web or at the Boys & Girls Club and may be mailed to: Boys & Girls Club, P.O. Box 873, Santa Cruz, CA 95061.
</p>
<p>
  For further information, call Julie Penniman at (831) 423-3138 ext. 29.

        <title>Panel discussion of intelligent design on Tuesday, October 11</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 03 Oct 2005 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>7463</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a><br>
<p>
  The debate over the teaching of intelligent design in public school science classes will be the subject of a public forum on the UCSC campus on Tuesday, October 11, at 7 p.m. in the Stevenson Events Center. The event is free and open to the public.
</p>
<p>
  Advocates promote intelligent design (ID) as an alternative to the theory of evolution, but it is strongly opposed by scientific organizations. The panel discussion is cosponsored by Stevenson College and Veritas Forum, a national Christian organization that organizes forums on college campuses to explore a broad range of issues in relation to religious faith. There will be two panelists in favor of teaching ID in schools and two opposed.
</p>
<p>
  Arguing against the teaching of intelligent design will be David Deamer, professor of chemistry and biochemistry and interim chair of the Department of Biomolecular Engineering, and Rev. Darrell Darling of United Methodist Church in Santa Cruz. Arguing in favor will be Robert D'Agostino, a professor at John Marshall Law School in Atlanta, and Paul Nelson, a senior fellow at the Discovery Institute in Seattle, a leading organization behind the ID movement.
</p>
<p>
  For additional information about the forum, contact Pamela Urfer at (831) 475-5157.

<p>
  The Music Department presents an evening of North Indian music featuring internationally acclaimed performer and award-winning composer Rajeev Taranath on sarod, Saturday, October 15, at 7:30 p.m. in the UCSC Music Center Recital Hall. He will be accompanied by Abhiman Kaushal on tabla.
</p>
<p>
  Taranath is a 1999-2000 recipient of the Indian government's highest award in the arts--the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award--given in recognition of outstanding achievement in the field of Hindustani instrumental music. A distinguished disciple of Maestro Ali Akbar Khan, Taranath masterfully combines the depth and rigor of the tradition of Hindustani classical music with an inspired imagination and emotional intensity in his performances.
</p>
<p>
  Kaushal is an outstanding tabla artist who is well known for his rich tone and clarity in performance. His numerous recordings include <i>Ravi Shankar in Venice, Farewell My Friend</i> (with Ravi Shankar), and <i>Passages</i> (with Ravi Shankar and Philip Glass). National Geographic has also recorded his tabla for the soundtrack to the documentary <i>Man Eaters of North India</i>.
</p>
<p>
  This concert is funded by the Ali Akbar Khan Endowment for Classical Indian Music and by the Kamil and Talat Hasan Endowed Chair for Classical Indian Music at UCSC. For more information, contact the UCSC Ticket Office, (831) 459-2159.

        <title>Cota-Robles Fellows recognized</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 03 Oct 2005 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>7460</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a><br>
<p>
  UCSC's Cota-Robles Fellows were recognized Thursday at a reception at the University Center.
</p>
<p>
  The Cota-Robles Fellowships (named for Eugene Cota-Robles, who began the program) is a multi-year fellowship for graduate students pursuing doctoral degrees with the goal of an academic career.
</p>
<p>
  The fellowship program is designed to increase the number of qualified candidates for faculty positions within the University of California, with the added effort of increasing the diversity of such candidates.
</p>
<p>
  "The reception for the fellows was a first on campus, but will become an annual event, said Lisa Sloan, vice provost and dean of <a href="http://gradstudies.ucsc.edu/index.html">Graduate Studies.</a> About 25 Cota-Robles Fellows attended, getting a chance to meet each other as well as Chancellor Denice D. Denton and Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor David Kliger.
</p>
<p>
  "This was a wonderful first-time event," said Sloan. "The fellows made some new connections with each other and renewed old connections. They also had a chance to talk to me about some issues that were important to them. We hope to have many more events for all of our grads as the quarter progresses," she added.
</p>
<p>
  The campus awards 10 Cota-Robles fellowships a year. Each department nominates students, the Graduate Council makes recoomendations, and the Grad Division issues the awards.
</p>
<p>
  Cota-Robles Fellows are assisted by formal and informal group orientations, individual advice about academic matters, financial aid, postdoctoral opportunities, and through the provision of information about career planning, health care, and housing.
</p>
<p>
  Additional information on the Cota-Robles application process is available at <a href="http://graddiv.ucsc.edu/admissions/reqs.php">graddiv.ucsc.edu/admissions/reqs.php</a>

<p>
  The UCSC Arboretum will hold its annual Fall Plant Sale on Saturday, October 8, from noon to 4 p.m. The sale will take place at the Arboretum's Eucalyptus Grove on High Street near the intersection with Western Drive.
</p>
<p>
  For gardeners on the Central Coast, fall is always a good time to get new plants established. The Arboretum offers a wide range of plant selections, including drought-tolerant plants from Australia and South Africa, as well as California natives. Knowledgeable Arboretum staff and volunteers will be on hand at the sale to answer questions.
</p>
<p>
  Among the new plants available this year is featherhead <i>(Phylica pubescens</i>), an attractive and unusual South African shrub with soft, golden foliage. The narrow leaves are covered with hairs, and feathery bracts surround the flowerheads at the tip of each branch. The whole bush appears to glow when its golden hairs catch the sunlight.
</p>
<p>
  Another stunning plant available this year is swamp bottlebrush (<i>Beaufortia sparsa</i>) from western Australia. This large shrub sports colorful, bright-orange flower clusters that are attractive to birds.
</p>
<p>
  The sale will also feature several attractive cultivars of <i>Correa</i>, known as Australian fuchsias. A new variety with pink flowers, called 'Western Pink Star', is available this year. Some of the Australian fuchsias are good winter bloomers, and most will bloom well under oak trees.
</p>
<p>
  A complete list of the plants available at the sale is posted on the <a href="http://arboretum.ucsc.edu">Arboretum's web site</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The Arboretum's sale is held in conjunction with the fall plant sale of the California Native Plant Society. Both sales are open early (from 10 a.m. to noon) to members of the Arboretum Associates and the California Native Plant Society, and to the general public from noon to 4 p.m. Arboretum memberships will be available at the gate on the day of the sale.
</p>
<p>
  For more information about the sale, contact the UCSC Arboretum at (831) 427-2998. The Arboretum is open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. every day. Norrie's Gifts is open daily from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.

        <title>'Bodies in the Making' conference probes fascination with body modifications</title>

<a name="content" id="content"></a><br>
<a href="mailto:srapp@ucsc.edu">Scott Rappaport</a>
<p>
  The UCSC Institute for Advanced Feminist Research (IAFR) will present a three-day conference on body modification, October 14-16. The conference will explore our culture's fascination with body modifications that range from tattooing, piercing, and cutting, to anorexia, plastic surgery, organ transplants, and life-extension technologies.
</p>
<p>
  "Bodies in the Making: Transgressions and Transformations," will include five panels featuring presentations from 11 UCSC professors, six professors from other campuses, and four community members: a surgical nurse, a transsexual author and actress, a photographer, and a psychoanalyst.
</p>
<p>
  "Our purpose is not to medicalize, pathologize, or moralize," noted IAFR director Helene Moglen, who holds a UC Presidential Chair in Literature and who is coordinating the conference with Nancy Chen, UCSC professor of anthropology, and Katharine Norwood, the IAFR's assistant director. "We will be considering the personal and social meanings of practices that, while extremely varied, are also intriguingly related."
</p>
<p>
  "The conference is for academics and nonacademics," Moglen added. "The papers presented will be relatively short and designed for a general audience. We expect there to be lots of discussion and disagreement. This is an open event and we hope that community members will attend."
</p>
<p>
  The conference will begin at 2:30 p.m. on Friday, October 14, at the Porter Sesnon Gallery with presentations about the photographs and performance art of Hannah Wilke, whose work will be exhibited. From the 1970s until 1993, Wilke produced art that examined the body and its representation--culminating with a stark, moving series of photographs of her face and body during her struggle and eventual death from cancer.
</p>
<p>
  City University of New York sociology professor Victoria Pitts will deliver the keynote address, "Beauty, Body Image and Psychosocial Power" on Friday evening at 7:30 p.m. at the Stevenson College Event Center. Pitts will draw on insights from her forthcoming book, <i>Surgery Junkies: The Cultural Boundaries of Cosmetic Surgery,</i> as well as her previous work, <i>In the Flesh: The Cultural Politics of Body Modification</i> (Palgrave/Macmillan, 2003).
</p>
<p>
  Moglen said that the conference emerged from the recognition that in the 21st century, the body is experienced less as a fixed entity than as a changeable product and a project of technological, medical, and artistic invention. "There is a paradox at the heart of these body modification practices," Moglen noted. "On one hand, they are experienced as self-expressive and liberating; on the other, they can be seen as socially determined, economically driven, and culturally enmeshed."
</p>
<p>
  The conference will include a panel on cosmetic surgery and the culture of tattooing. University of Kentucky professor Virginia Blum, the author of <i>Flesh Wounds</i>, will present a paper on cosmetic surgery in extreme-makeover reality shows. Richard Roullard, a local surgical nurse, will discuss his volunteer work in Asia with the organization Interplast, which serves clients who have no other access to plastic surgery. Aleshia Brevard, a local transsexual author and actress, will describe her production of her own transgender identity through surgery and tattooing, and Santa Cruz photographer Kelley Richardson will show and discuss her photographs, which document tattoo culture in Santa Cruz.
</p>
<p>
  A second panel will explore the relation of body and mind from cultural and historical perspectives. UCSC sociology professor Gabriela Sandoval will analyze the practice of self-cutting among Latina youth, while University of Washington anthropology professor Lorna Rhodes will consider the implications of self-cutting among men in maximum security prisons. Psychoanalyst Sheila Namir will address issues of bodily integrity and subjectivity from both sides of the psychoanalytic couch, and UCSC anthropology graduate student John Marlovits will draw on his research in Seattle to explore the cultural politics of public psychiatry and psychopharmacology.
</p>
<p>
  During a panel on Saturday afternoon, Sharon Kaufman, professor of anthropology at UC San Francisco, will speak about organ transplants and life-extending medical practices; UCSC history of consciousness professor Donna Haraway will analyze the constitutive ties between human and animal bodies; Moglen will reflect on the processes of aging and trans-aging; and Maria Frangos, a UCSC graduate student in literature, will examine televised narratives of body modification and the quest for identity in reality TV.
</p>
<p>
  Participants in the final panel on Sunday will explore intentional and unintentional body modification practices that are the result of war, torture, organ transplantation, and prosthetic technology. San Francisco anthropologist Steve Kurzman will examine armaments, bodies, and prostheses in the context of the war in Iraq, suggesting how that war affects our concept of bodies at home. UCSC anthropology professor Nancy Chen will also trace the circulation of cadaver bodies from prisons to plastination factories to exhibits such as the "Universe Within," a display of actual human bodies that has been touring the country to record crowds.
</p>
<p>
  "Body modification is a phenomenon that spans generations," Moglen observed. "We are looking at these issues through a cross-generational lens and we expect to have a large cross-generational audience. It is clear that people of all ages have a lot to teach--and learn from--one another."

<p>
  Assistant theater arts professor Alma Martinez has been awarded a Fulbright Scholar grant to conduct research and lecture at La Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru in Lima during the 2006-07 academic year. Martinez will work with Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani, one of the oldest and most important popular theater companies in Latin America. She will also lecture on the subject of the interconnectivity of Teatro Chicano in the U.S. and the New Popular Theatre (Nuevo Teatro Popular) in Latin America.
</p>
<p>
  Martinez is one of approximately 800 U.S. faculty and professionals who will travel abroad to some 140 countries during 2006-07 through the Fulbright Scholar Program. Established in 1946 under legislation introduced by the late Senator J. William Fulbright of Arkansas, the program aims to build mutual understanding between the people of the United States and other countries.
</p>
<p>
  Recipients of Fulbright Scholar awards are selected on the basis of academic or professional achievement and because they have demonstrated extraordinary leadership potential in their fields. Among the thousands of prominent Fulbright Scholar alumni are Milton Friedman, Nobel Prize-winning economist; Alan Leshner, CEO of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS); Rita Dove, Pulitzer Prize-winning poet; and Craig Barrett, CEO of Intel Corporation.

<p>
  The University of California College Prep program's innovative "cybertutoring" project has been recognized as an outstanding use of technology in higher education.
</p>
<p>
  WCET, formerly the Western Cooperative for Educational Telecommunications, selected CyberTutor from among dozens of nominations for its second annual WCET Outstanding Work (WOW) award. Recipients will receive their awards at WCET's annual conference in San Francisco on November 2-5.
</p>
<p>
  Through CyberTutor, which employs UC undergraduates as tutors, hundreds of high school students have received immediate online academic assistance in their homework assignments, exam preparation, and college application process.
</p>
<p>
  WCET advances the effective use of technology in higher education. Each year, the organization recognizes five institutions and higher education systems for their innovative and effective uses of technologies in educating and serving students.
</p>

<p>
  Three professors and two graduate students at UC Santa Cruz were honored last week for their teaching.
</p>
<p>
  The Division of Social Sciences presented the division's Distinguished Teaching Award, known as the "Golden Apple Award," during the dean's annual fall convocation on September 29. The awards recognize outstanding undergraduate teaching in the social sciences; each award carries with it a $500 cash prize and an engraved plaque. Recipients are:
</p>
<p>
  * <strong>Barbara Rogoff,</strong> professor of psychology<br>
  * <strong>Eva Bertram,</strong> assistant professor of politics<strong><br></strong>* <strong>Triloki Pandey,</strong> professor of anthropology
</p>
<p>
  "At UCSC, we pride ourselves on the quality of instruction we offer, and these awards recognize some of the best teachers we have," said Michael Hutchison, interim dean of the Social Sciences Division.
</p>
<p>
  Rogoff, a leading developmental psychologist, has spent more than 25 years exploring how children learn. Her work has helped illuminate the extent to which notions of human development are culturally defined. Bertram specializes in American politics, including welfare and social policy, the politics of work, and drug-control policy. Pandey's areas of research include the religion and politics of the Pueblo Indians of the American Southwest and the tribal peoples of Himalayan Terai and northeast India.
</p>
<p>
  The Golden Apple Award is presented annually to as many as three faculty members. The recipients were selected by Hutchison from a list of recommendations compiled by a faculty committee based on nominations put forth by department chairs. The committee is chaired by Daniel Press, a professor of environmental studies. The annual awards were established in 1991.
</p>
<p>
  In addition, recipients of the 2005 Milam-McGinty-Kaun Award for Distinguished Teaching by graduate students were announced. Recipients are:
</p>
<p>
  * <strong>Kuntal Das,</strong> a doctoral candidate in economics<br>
  * <strong>Paul Held,</strong> a doctoral student in politics
</p>
<p>
  Named after David Kaun, the professor of economics who endowed the award, and the first recipients, Garrett Milam and Matt McGinty, the award honors graduate students in the fields of anthropology, economics, education, environmental studies, politics, psychology, and sociology. Each year, one recipient from economics and one student in another field receive $1,000 each.
</p>
<p>
  Kaun established the award in 2000 with a $50,000 gift to the campus. Milam and McGinty were teaching assistants in Kaun's <i>Intermediate Microeconomic Theory</i> course.

        <title>Two-car accident claims the life of a UCSC student</title>

<p>
  An early-morning automobile accident on Hagar Drive on Tuesday claimed the life of a UCSC student and injured three other people. Kenton Dornbush, a 20-year-old College Nine student, died early Wednesday at Regional Medical Center of injuries sustained during the two-car accident. He had been airlifted via helicopter to the San Jose trauma center.
</p>
<p>
  Two of the others involved in the accident were students, both of whom were transported to a Santa Cruz hospital; the fourth person, not a student at UCSC, was also airlifted from the scene.
</p>
<p>
  The head-on accident occurred shortly after 8 a.m. midway between Coolidge Drive and the East Remote Parking Lot, just above the access road to the Village housing area. Hagar Drive was closed to through traffic until approximately 11 a.m.
</p>
<p>
  Kenton, who enrolled at UCSC in fall 2003, was very interested in the arts, especially in photography, and was making plans to create his own major.
</p>
<p>
  At the time of the accident, he was a passenger in a white Honda Civic driven by Sean Laws, a 22-year-old not believed to be affiliated with UCSC. The vehicle was traveling down Hagar. The driver was airlifted to Stanford University Medical Center.
</p>
<p>
  Traveling uphill in the other vehicle, a green Honda Civic, were Tatiana Starets, a 25-year-old Oakes student, and Hannah Schilperoort, another College Nine student, age 26. Both of the women were taken by ambulance to Dominican Hospital.
</p>
<p>
  UCSC police believe that the vehicle heading downhill was traveling at a high speed just before the accident occurred. The accident was still under investigation by mid-afternoon on Wednesday.
</p>
<p>
  No information on the extent of the injuries to the accident's three survivors was available on Wednesday.
</p>
<p>
  In addition to campus police, personnel from the UCSC Fire Department and Santa Cruz Fire Department, as well as AMR (American Medical Response) paramedics responded to the accident.

  An early-morning head-on automobile accident on Hagar Drive injured three UCSC students on Tuesday, including one whose injuries were severe enough to require a helicopter airlift to a San Jose trauma center. The two other students were transported to a Santa Cruz hospital; the fourth person, not a student at UCSC, was also airlifted from the scene.
</p>
<p>
  The two-car accident occurred shortly after 8 a.m. midway between Coolidge Drive and the East Remote Parking Lot, just above the access road to the Village housing area. Hagar Drive was closed to through traffic until approximately 11 a.m.
</p>
<p>
  The most seriously injured is a 20-year-old male, a College Nine student. He was a passenger in a white Honda Civic driven by a 22-year-old male not believed to be affiliated with UCSC. The vehicle was traveling down Hagar at the time of the accident. The student was airlifted by helicopter to Regional Medical Center in San Jose. The driver was airlifted to Stanford University Medical Center.
</p>
<p>
  Traveling uphill in the other vehicle, a green Honda Civic, were two females, a 25-year-old Oakes student and another College Nine student, age 26. Both of the women were taken by ambulance to Dominican Hospital.

<p>
  UCSC police believe that the vehicle heading downhill may have been traveling at a high speed just before the accident occurred. The accident was still under investigation by mid-afternoon on Tuesday.

        <title>New book on coevolution by biologist John Thompson</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_7420" align="alignright" width="140"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/09/thompson_bookcover.140.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7420" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/09/thompson_bookcover.140.jpg" alt="" width="140" height="205" /></a>[/caption]

<p>
  Coevolution shapes the interactions between species, whether predators and prey, hosts and parasites, or mutually beneficial partnerships such as those between flowering plants and their pollinators. In fact, most plants and animals require coevolved interactions with other species in order to survive.
</p>
<p>
  John N. Thompson, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, has now published his third book on the subject of coevolution, <i>The Geographic Mosaic of Coevolution</i> (University of Chicago Press, 2005).
</p>
<p>
  Thompson defines coevolution as "reciprocal evolutionary change in interacting species driven by natural selection." It is one of the most important processes in the evolution and organization of life on Earth.
</p>
<p>
  "One of the things we've come to realize is that much of evolution turns out to be coevolution, and ecological communities are based on these deeply coevolved relationships between species," he said.
</p>
<p>
  Thompson's research and books have been highly influential in the development of coevolution as a field of research. His previous book, <i>The Coevolutionary Process</i> (1994) provided the framework for a geographic mosaic theory of coevolution, which emphasizes that every species is a collection of genetically distinct populations that are linked across landscapes, resulting in complex geographic mosaics of species interactions that can evolve differently in different locations.
</p>
<p>
  The field has developed rapidly over the past ten years. In the new book, Thompson integrates approaches from evolutionary ecology, population genetics, phylogeography, systematics, evolutionary biochemistry and physiology, and molecular biology. Using models, data, and hypotheses to develop a complete conceptual framework, the book draws on examples from a wide range of taxa and environments, illustrating the expanding breadth and depth of research in coevolutionary biology.

<p>
  Carnegie Mellon University will award its prestigious Dickson Prize in Science to David Haussler, professor of biomolecular engineering and a leader in the field of bioinformatics
</p>
<p>
  Haussler will receive an award of $50,000 and will deliver a public lecture as part of the prize ceremony to be held at Carnegie Mellon University in March 2006.
</p>
<p>
  A Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator, Haussler directs the Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering (CBSE) at UCSC and is scientific codirector of the California Institute for Quantitative Biomedical Research (QB3). He has done pioneering work in the fields of computational learning theory and bioinformatics. At UCSC, he has been instrumental in establishing strong and productive interdisciplinary interactions between computer scientists and molecular biologists.
</p>
<p>
  In the 1990s, Haussler introduced the use of powerful statistical models (hidden Markov models and related methods) to the analysis of biological sequences of DNA, RNA, and proteins. This work led to his involvement in the International Human Genome Project and his group's vital contribution to that project, providing a computational solution that allowed the completion of the first working draft of the human genome.
</p>
<p>
  Haussler's group published the human genome sequence on the World Wide Web for public access and went on to develop and maintain the <a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu">UCSC Genome Browser</a>. This interactive web-based "microscope" allows researchers to view analyzed and annotated genome sequences of humans and other organisms at any scale, from a full chromosome down to an individual nucleotide. Biomedical researchers throughout the world use this browser extensively as they seek to understand and use the vast amount of information contained in the genome sequences.
</p>
<p>
  Haussler uses the tools his team created to conduct ongoing research in comparative and evolutionary genomics. His group has pioneered a computer-based, probabilistic process for analyzing the genome of one mammalian species by comparing it to the genomes of one or more other species. Algorithms his team developed have identified segments that have been extremely well conserved throughout millions of years of evolution. Evolutionary theory predicts that these "ultra-conserved" regions represent novel functional elements of the genome, but their exact function remains a mystery. The ongoing investigation of these ultra-conserved regions in Haussler's lab may lead to a better understanding of how the genome works.
</p>
<p>
  In his most ambitious project, Haussler and his colleagues are using the genomes of living mammals to attempt to reconstruct by computer the entire genome of the common ancestor of all placental mammals. While this work is still in the very early stages, it has already generated considerable interest.
</p>
<p>
  A fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the American Association for Artificial Intelligence, Haussler received the 2003 ACM/AAAI Allen Newell Award, and <i>R&D Magazine</i> named him "Scientist of the Year" in 2001.
</p>
<p>
  The Dickson Prize was established by a gift to Carnegie Mellon University from the estate of Dr. and Mrs. Joseph Dickson to fund an annual prize to persons who have made outstanding contributions to science in the United States. Dr. Dickson was a prominent physician in the Pittsburgh area, and it was his wish to bring as much prestige and honor as possible to the university and to Pittsburgh with this prize. Since 1970, the university has awarded the Dickson Prize to prominent researchers in such areas as mathematics, cell biology, civil engineering, metallurgy, computer science, genetics, and physics.

  In Hurricane Katrina news:<br>
  The <i>New York Times</i> called on racism expert <b>David Wellman</b> of community studies to discuss the racial divide apparent even in relief concerts. Wellman was quoted in a <i>Los Angeles Times</i> article about the debate over whether race played a role in response efforts. Wellman was also quoted in the <i>Sacramento Bee,</i> discussing how the natural disaster has shined a spotlight on the vulnerability of black Americans. His comments were picked up by the <i>Monterey County Herald</i>. . . . The <i>New York Times</i> contacted professor emeritus of psychology <b>Elliot Aronson</b> in the wake of the Katrina disaster for insight into the surge of lawlessness that broke out. . . . Politics professor <b>Daniel Wirls</b> helped the <i>San Jose Mercury News</i> sort out the political fallout for President Bush of his handling of the Katrina disaster. Wirls also fielded a call from the <i>Santa Cruz Sentinel</i> about a judge's ruling that the Pledge of Allegiance is unconstitutional. . . . <b>Tom Pettigrew</b>, research professor of psychology and an expert on racism, was a guest on Community TV's <i>Voices</i> program, discussing "the storm after the storm." . . . Senior cook <b>Bruce Holgers</b> was featured in a <i>Santa Cruz Sentinel</i> story about volunteers pitching in to help hurricane victims. After a brief Red Cross training, Holgers was flown to Baton Rouge to help feed the hungry. . . . The new community studies internship to help hurricane-stricken areas coordinated by <b>Mike Rotkin</b> got broad play, including coverage by the Associated Press, KTVU TV, the <i>San Jose Mercury News, Tuscaloosa</i> (Alabama) <i>News,</i> <i>Contra Costa Times, Modesto Bee</i>, radio stations in Pennsylvania, Louisiana, and Alabama, as well as the <i>Santa Cruz Sentinel</i>, the <i>Monterey County Herald</i>, and KSBW TV. . . . Theater arts lecturer <b>Don Williams</b> was quoted in a <i>Santa Cruz Sentinel</i> article about the role of race in the government response to Hurricane Katrina.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Ann Pace,</strong> assistant director of the Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering, was quoted in a <i>Santa Cruz Sentinel</i> story about a training grant for stem cell research.

</p>
<p>
  The <i>Washington Times</i> cited the work of economist <b>Lori Kletzer</b> in a story about the hidden cost of free trade and the shortcomings of worker-retraining programs.
</p>
<p>
  The <i>Houston Chronicle</i> quoted history professor Dana Frank about about what it really means to buy American, noting that "trade policy, not consumer demand, drives global commerce" as it creates job losses and closed plants, and hurts workers while boosting corporate bottom lines. Vermont's <i>Times Argus</i> also picked up the story.
</p>
<p>
  An article in <i>Science News</i> about the most distant gamma-ray burst ever discovered included a quote from astrophysicist <strong>Stan Woosley.</strong>

<a href="mailto:jmcnulty@ucsc.edu">Jennifer McNulty</a>
<p>
  Ellen Moir, executive director of the UCSC New Teacher Center, received the 2005 Harold W. McGraw Jr. Prize in Education last week for her pioneering work in new teacher professional development.
</p>
<p>
  Also receiving the McGraw Prize this year were Barbara Taylor Bowman, cofounder of the Erikson Institute, and Sharon Lynn Kagan, Marx Professor of Early Childhood and Family Policy and associate dean for policy at Teachers College. Recipients, selected by a board of judges from a selection of nominees, receive a $25,000 award and a commemorative statuette. Past honorees include former First Lady Barbara Bush, former Governor James B. Hunt Jr., and former U.S. Secretaries of Education Richard Riley and Rod Paige.
</p>
<p>
  Moir was recognized for her leadership in the field of teacher induction and her development of a mentoring program that pairs novice teachers with veteran classroom instructors. Moir's mentoring model dramatically improves the retention rate of new teachers. Nationally, the dropout rate among new teachers is 50 percent after five years, compared to retention rates as high as 88 percent among participants in the New Teacher Center's mentoring programs.
</p>
<p>
  "Support early in their career makes all the difference for new teachers, and we know that teacher quality is the single most important factor in student success," said Moir, a passionate advocate for equitable learning opportunities for all students.<br>
  <br>
  Moir is the founding director of the New Teacher Center, which has become a national resource for new teacher training since opening its doors in 1998. The center focuses on improving student performance by increasing teacher retention and effectiveness.
</p>
<p>
  Moir has also served 17 years as director of the Santa Cruz New Teacher Project, a beginning teacher induction program that has supported more than 10,000 beginning teachers during the first two years of their careers. From 1995 to 2000, she was the director of teacher education at UCSC. Moir frequently addresses educators and policymakers on topics related to new teacher development. In 2003, she received the California Council on Teacher Education Distinguished Teacher Educator Award.

<p>
  Carnegie Mellon University will award its prestigious Dickson Prize in Science to David Haussler, professor of biomolecular engineering and a leader in the field of bioinformatics.
</p>
<p>
  Haussler will receive an award of $50,000 and will deliver a public lecture as part of the prize ceremony to be held at Carnegie Mellon University in March 2006.
</p>
<p>
  A Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator, Haussler directs the Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering (CBSE) at UCSC and is scientific codirector of the California Institute for Quantitative Biomedical Research (QB3). He has done pioneering work in the fields of computational learning theory and bioinformatics. At UCSC, he has been instrumental in establishing strong and productive interdisciplinary interactions between computer scientists and molecular biologists.
</p>
<p>
  In the 1990s, Haussler introduced the use of powerful statistical models (hidden Markov models and related methods) to the analysis of biological sequences of DNA, RNA, and proteins. This work led to his involvement in the International Human Genome Project and his group's vital contribution to that project, providing a computational solution that allowed the completion of the first working draft of the human genome.
</p>
<p>
  Haussler's group published the human genome sequence on the World Wide Web for public access and went on to develop and maintain the <a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu">UCSC Genome Browser</a>. This interactive web-based "microscope" allows researchers to view analyzed and annotated genome sequences of humans and other organisms at any scale, from a full chromosome down to an individual nucleotide. Biomedical researchers throughout the world use this browser extensively as they seek to understand and use the vast amount of information contained in the genome sequences.
</p>
<p>
  Haussler uses the tools his team created to conduct ongoing research in comparative and evolutionary genomics. His group has pioneered a computer-based, probabilistic process for analyzing the genome of one mammalian species by comparing it to the genomes of one or more other species. Algorithms his team developed have identified segments that have been extremely well conserved throughout millions of years of evolution. Evolutionary theory predicts that these "ultra-conserved" regions represent novel functional elements of the genome, but their exact function remains a mystery. The ongoing investigation of these ultra-conserved regions in Haussler's lab may lead to a better understanding of how the genome works.
</p>
<p>
  In his most ambitious project, Haussler and his colleagues are using the genomes of living mammals to attempt to reconstruct by computer the entire genome of the common ancestor of all placental mammals. While this work is still in the very early stages, it has already generated considerable interest.
</p>
<p>
  A fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the American Association for Artificial Intelligence, Haussler received the 2003 ACM/AAAI Allen Newell Award, and <i>R&D Magazine</i> named him "Scientist of the Year" in 2001.
</p>
<p>
  The Dickson Prize was established by a gift to Carnegie Mellon University from the estate of Dr. and Mrs. Joseph Dickson to fund an annual prize to persons who have made outstanding contributions to science in the United States. Dr. Dickson was a prominent physician in the Pittsburgh area, and it was his wish to bring as much prestige and honor as possible to the university and to Pittsburgh with this prize. Since 1970, the university has awarded the Dickson Prize to prominent researchers in such areas as mathematics, cell biology, civil engineering, metallurgy, computer science, genetics, and physics.

<a name="content" id="content"></a><br>
<a href="mailto:jmcnulty@ucsc.edu">Jennifer McNulty</a>
<p>
  In a harsh critique of the death penalty before a gathering of the nation's lawyers last month, U.S. Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens said recent exonerations of death row inmates reveal serious procedural flaws that undermine the way capital punishment is administered in this country.
</p>
<p>
  Stevens's remarks before members of the American Bar Association marked one of the very few times that any member of the current court has acknowledged <i>systemic</i> flaws that plague death penalty trials in the United States, said Craig Haney, professor of psychology at UCSC and author of the just-published book, <i>Death By Design: Capital Punishment as a Social Psychological System</i> (Oxford, England: Oxford University Press, 2005).
</p>
<p>
  In <i>Death By Design</i>, Haney addresses the fundamental question, "How can otherwise normal, moral people participate in a process designed to take the life of another?" Haney, one of the nation's most respected death penalty researchers, finds the answer in a set of procedures and practices that systematically "distance and disengage" those charged with deciding the fate of defendants.
</p>
<p>
  Building on more than 25 years of his own and others' empirical research, Haney discusses the system of capital punishment as a whole and identifies the elements that skew the system to facilitate death sentences. Three factors emerge as pivotal:
</p>
<p>
  * <strong>Jury selection</strong>--Like Stevens, Haney is critical of the jury selection process in capital cases. By systematically screening out opponents of capital punishment, the process produces unrepresentative juries (current surveys show about 70 percent of respondents favor the death penalty) and juries that include a high concentration of people who are more inclined to convict defendants.
</p>
<p>
  * <strong>Sentencing instructions</strong>--Numerous studies reveal that jurors do not understand the instructions they receive as they begin the sentencing phase of capital trials, particularly the concept of "mitigation," the legal grounds on which jurors can choose a life sentence rather than death. "Death becomes the default outcome when jurors don't understand the instructions they're given regarding mercy," said Haney.
</p>
<p>
  * <strong>Cultural and media myths about crime</strong>--Print and broadcast news, as well as crime-based television dramas, exaggerate the rate of violent crime and demonize violent criminals without providing any real explanation of the forces that influenced their behavior, said Haney. As a result, the public knows little about the backgrounds of violent criminals and the factors that contribute to violent crime, including poverty, neglect, racial discrimination, and childhood abuse. "Media portrayals of violent criminals are neither neutral nor accurate, and they have helped to create an unprecedented level of punitiveness in our society," he said. "Most people lack firsthand experience with the criminal justice system but are immersed in these misleading messages and images. Many people believe capital punishment is necessary for public safety without understanding how the system really operates or the life circumstances of the defendants who are most often targeted by it."
</p>
<p>
  Haney maintains that these factors work in concert to undermine the reliability of the criminal justice process and compromise the fairness of the outcome of capital cases. "The flaws that riddle the system combine and operate in tandem. They help enable people to participate in behavior--actions designed to take the life of another person--that many of them otherwise would reject and resist," he said.
</p>
<p>
  Haney suggests the following reforms:
</p>
<p>
  * <strong>Education</strong>--Public-opinion polls repeatedly indicate that the people most in favor of the death penalty are the least informed. "People believe the death penalty deters murder, yet there is no reliable evidence that it does," said Haney. "Many believe people sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole eventually will get out, although that does not happen." Haney would enlist journalists in an effort to educate the public about capital punishment, but he cautioned that reporters would have to educate themselves first to prevent amplification of inaccurate messages that are sometimes politically motivated. "Unfortunately, the death penalty has become so highly politicized that I'm afraid some politicians perpetuate these myths--knowing full well they are incorrect--simply because they believe these 'tough' stances will help them get elected," said Haney.
</p>
<p>
  * <strong>Media coverage</strong>--The media must work harder to provide a more accurate and balanced picture of the real causes of violence in our society. Reporters tend to rely on law enforcement and government sources for much of their crime coverage. "Reporters don't know where to look for the other side of the story, and the result is a one-dimensional, incomplete flow of information that's fed to the public," said Haney. "Violence is most often perpetrated by people who are damaged by mistreatment and other traumas suffered earlier in life." Research by Haney and others indicates that the overwhelming majority of capital defendants come from abusive, impoverished backgrounds, and often there are signs early in their lives that they were troubled by these experiences.
</p>
<p>
  * <strong>Jury instructions</strong>--Building on recent opinions by U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, Haney would bolster the requirement that attorneys fully and completely investigate and present to jurors the social history of defendants during the sentencing process. In addition, to improve juror understanding of the concept of mitigation, Haney would revise the way instructions are written, not only to avoid the confusion that now plagues them, but also to minimize the dehumanization and distancing effects of the process.
</p>
<p>
  When the U.S. Supreme Court reinstituted the death penalty in 1976, justices broadened the scope of evidence and stipulated that jurors must receive instructions that would guide their discretion as they weighed the defendant's fate. But current efforts fall far short, concluded Haney, who has coined the phrase "empathic divide" to describe the vast gap that separates jurors from defendants in capital cases. The empathic divide erodes the psychological barrier that, under normal circumstances, makes it exceedingly difficult for most people to participate in the taking of life. Without widespread reforms like those he has suggested, Haney is not hopeful that the divide will be bridged any time soon.

        <title>Economics Department ranked ninth in world in international finance</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a><br>
<a href="mailto:jmcnulty@ucsc.edu">Jennifer McNulty</a>
<p>
  <a name="OLE_LINK5" id="OLE_LINK5"></a>The Economics Department was ranked ninth in the world in the field of international finance in a survey of more than 300 public and private research universities.
</p>
<p>
  The ranking is based on the research productivity of faculty as measured by scholarly publications in 63 academic journals from 1993 to 2003. The survey results were published by <a href="http://www.econphd.net">econphd.net</a>, an online resource for prospective graduate students in economics.
</p>
<p>
  UCSC's high ranking in international finance--between Columbia University and New York University--is the result of a concerted effort to build excellence in international economics, said economics professor and former department chair Michael Hutchison, who is now interim dean of the Division of Social Sciences.
</p>
<p>
  "These results reflect the work we've done to recruit top scholars and graduate students, and we are pleased to be at the top of the list," said Hutchison. "
</p>
<p>
  The Economics Department at UCSC has made a concerted effort over the past 15 years to develop complementary programs in the international field. The concentration of scholarly research and teaching in international economics has led to a highly distinguished program," said Hutchison.
</p>
<p>
  The department's focus on global economics, and the hiring of top international economists, set the stage for the doctoral program in international economics, which awarded its first Ph.D. in 1992. In addition, the Santa Cruz Center for International Economics (SCCIE) sponsors research, conferences, scholarly exchanges, and other activities.
</p>
<p>
  Economics is the fastest-growing and one of the most popular undergraduate majors at UCSC. The department offers degrees in economics, business management economics, and global economics. It also offers a joint degree in information systems management that is offered with the Computer Sciences Department, and a dual B.A./M.S. degree that offers a B.A. in economics in four years and a master's in applied economics and finance after a fifth year of study. A separate master's in applied economics and finance is also available.

<p>
  Chancellor Denice D. Denton will be sworn in as UCSC's ninth chancellor as part of a series of fall events that will be short on ceremony and long on substance.
</p>
<p>
  "Instead of spending resources on pomp and circumstance, we will invest in our academic priorities and our students," Chancellor Denton said. "The goal of the investiture period is to create an opportunity to celebrate UC Santa Cruz, advance diversity and excellence, support our students, engage our community partners, and stimulate and herald our future accomplishments."
</p>
<p>
  UC President Robert C. Dynes will participate in a brief ceremony investing Denton as UCSC's chancellor on Friday, November 4, followed immediately by her inaugural address.
</p>
<p>
  A symposium, "Achieving Excellence through Diversity," will take place on Thursday and Friday, November 3 and 4. On Thursday afternoon, Shirley Ann Jackson, 18th president of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, will deliver the keynote address; Jackson will also receive the third annual UCSC Foundation Medal.
</p>
<p>
  On Saturday, November 5, Chancellor Denton will host UCSC's annual Scholarships Benefit Dinner--an event at which it was announced last year that more than $1 million in scholarships and fellowships for students had been raised. At this year's dinner, UCSC benefactor Jack Baskin will receive the foundation's first-ever Fiat Lux Award for service to the campus.
</p>
<p>
  Events include:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Symposium, Achieving Excellence Through Diversity:</strong> Shirley Ann Jackson, president of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, will lead a discussion on the best practices in diversity, access, and inclusion. Thursday, Nov. 3, 2:30 p.m., Media Theater, and continuing at 8:30 a.m. on Friday, at College Nine/College Ten, with breakout sessions.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Investiture of Chancellor Denton:</strong> UC President Robert C. Dynes will preside over a brief ceremony investing Denice D. Denton as UCSC's ninth chancellor. Chancellor Denton's inaugural address will follow. Friday, Nov. 4, 1:30 p.m., Music Center Recital Hall.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Scholarships Benefit Dinner:</strong> The third annual Scholarships Benefit Dinner will celebrate the successful conclusion of the Cornerstone Campaign, while raising additional money to fund scholarships and fellowships. Saturday, Nov. 5, 6 p.m., University Center.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Regional events:</strong> UCSC is collaborating with partners throughout the region to host a variety of events this fall that offer the public additional opportunities to join in the celebration of the chancellor's arrival.

<a name="content" id="content"></a><br>
<a href="mailto:srapp@ucsc.edu">Scott Rappaport</a>
<p>
  Associate professor of history Brian Catlos has spent years researching how Christians, Muslims, and Jews interact.
</p>
<p>
  Although his main focus has been on studying ethnic and religious minorities in the Mediterranean during medieval times, Catlos has inadvertently discovered a pattern running throughout history that applies directly to present-day political and social realities.
</p>
<p>
  "Where my research and data leads, though not intentionally, is to debunk the notion of a conflict of civilizations--a conflict between groups of people who identify themselves as Christians, Jews, or Muslims and who articulate their struggle as a result of ideology and national identity," said Catlos. "Rather what's really behind history and contemporary human affairs is the interest of relatively small groups who often interact without regard to ideologies, national, or religious boundaries."
</p>
<p>
  "Social stability, particularly between members of different cultural groups, seems to be related to the degree to which people depend on each other and fulfill each other's needs," Catlos added. "When you have that situation, individuals cease to identify themselves primarily or exclusively as Christians, Muslims, and Jews."
</p>
<p>
  Catlos noted that while the Middle Ages were certainly very different from today, he has found that the same basic social principles still operate.
</p>
<p>
  "When groups engage in hostilities, we tend to categorize it as a struggle between religions," said Catlos. "For example, the struggle between the United States and Al-Queda--we're told it's a struggle between Western culture and Islamic culture. Yet if you look in the <i>New York Times,</i> you can see a photo of George Bush and Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia holding hands at Crawford Ranch. It's a misguided analysis and much more complicated than that. What we have in the world today--as in the medieval era--is a situation where individuals prefer to identify themselves as members of cultural communities, for example, as Christians, Muslims, and Jews, when they are in fact pursuing economic and political interests related to their own ambitions."
</p>
<p>
  The author of a recent book titled <i>The Victors and the Vanquished: Christians and Muslims in Catalonia and Aragon, 1050-1300</i> (Cambridge University Press, 2004), Catlos came to UCSC in 2002 after spending six years in Barcelona where he was a research fellow at the Spanish National Research Council and held a postdoctoral fellowship through Boston University. He has just been granted advance tenure and awarded a $25,000 grant from the UC President's Research Fellowships in the Humanities to continue his work in the coming academic year.
</p>
<p>
  "I'm looking at empirical data gathered in the archives and developing a theory to apply outside the Middle Ages and the Mediterranean--to come up with a model for understanding under what circumstances members of different religious and political groups bring their religion into the forefront," said Catlos. "For example, Bosnia and Kosovo have become the poster children for ethno-religious intolerance. Yet in the years prior to the war there, the same area was remarkable for political, religious, and ethnic integration. I'm interested in looking at why and under what circumstances we get that shift from social stability to instability."
</p>
<p>
  Catlos observed that engaging in this type of historical research is his way of testing common assertions that there is a fundamental and irresolvable conflict between Christian and Muslim, or Jewish and Muslim, cultures. He points out that throughout history, there has been a widespread phenomenon of elites interacting with whoever will serve them best.
</p>
<p>
  "Ethnicity and religion becomes the language with which we speak about our aims and politics, but I don't think it's what's actually behind them," said Catlos. "We have to critically analyze the present in the same way that we critically analyze the past."
</p>
<p>
  "The message is for us to keep focused on what's happening and read beyond the official histories--whether we're talking about the Middle Ages or the present," said Catlos. "We should not accept at face value those appealing, simplistic analyses. They are ultimately wrong, but we tend to be attached to them because they're so self-affirming of our beliefs," he added.

        <title>New campus maps available</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 26 Sep 2005 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>7402</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  The large four-color map of the UCSC campus has just been reprinted; both poster and folded versions are available for purchase at the Bay Tree Bookstore ($7.99 and $4.95, respectively). While the map artwork is updated regularly for the <a href="http://maps.ucsc.edu">campus map web site</a>, reprinting happens only every other year.
</p>
<p>
  New maps have been delivered throughout the campus over the past two weeks to get them posted as widely as possible. "We used to simply place them in the bookstore, and ask people to go buy them," says Susan Willats, manager of the campus map project. "It was efficient, but not very effective." The new maps are also being placed in campus transit shelters.
</p>
<p>
  The poster-size map artwork was created in 1999 by a professional cartographer, using existing maps and aerial photos. Since then, Willats has coordinated the regular updating of the large map, close-up maps of the colleges, one-page navigational maps to common destinations on the campus, and the map web site.
</p>
<p>
  The artwork is maintained by Helen Cole of Graphic Services; funding is provided by the Business and Administrative Services Division. For more information, or to request a map for posting, contact Susan Willats at <a href="mailto:willats@ucsc.edu">willats@ucsc.edu</a> or (831) 459-3759.

        <title>Santa Cruz Cancer Benefit Group funds cancer research fellowship</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 26 Sep 2005 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_7400" align="alignright" width="140"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/09/compton_jennifer.140.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7400" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/09/compton_jennifer.140.jpg" alt="Jennifer Compton Photo: Tim Stephens" width="140" height="164" /></a>Jennifer Compton Photo: Tim Stephens[/caption]

<p>
  The Santa Cruz Cancer Benefit Group (SCCBG) has established a new fellowship to support cancer research at UCSC. The SCCBG Research Fellowship is an annual award of $10,000 to support a UCSC graduate student or postdoctoral researcher engaged in cancer-related research.
</p>
<p>
  The group awarded the first SCCBG Research Fellowship to Jennifer Compton, a postdoctoral researcher studying genetic factors involved in breast cancer. The fellowship will support Compton's work with Gary Silberstein, a research scientist in the Department of Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology.
</p>
<p>
  The SCCBG, which celebrated its 10th anniversary last spring, raises funds for distribution to local cancer support groups and cancer research organizations. The new award represents the group's first gift to UCSC, where scientists are engaged in a broad range of cancer-related research projects. These include studies of the molecular mechanisms and genetic factors involved in cancer, as well as efforts to identify and synthesize new cancer-fighting compounds.
</p>
<p>
  "A lot of people in our group were not even aware that UCSC is involved in cancer research. We are very excited about supporting this important research in our local area," said SCCBG director Jeni Brill.
</p>
<p>
  Cancer research at UCSC is primarily sponsored by the National Institutes of Health and other major organizations such as the American Cancer Society. Silberstein, for example, has grants from the National Cancer Institute to support his research on genes involved in breast cancer.
</p>
<p>
  The project that Compton will work on with funding from the SCCBG fellowship represents an important new direction for his research, Silberstein said. "This award enables us to launch a new area of research in our lab, so it's very important for us," he said.
</p>
<p>
  Compton will be studying the "breast cancer predisposition gene" known as BRCA1. Mutations in this gene greatly increase the risk of breast cancer. Compton's research is aimed at understanding the normal role of BRCA1 in mammary tissue and the role of hormones in regulating the gene's activity.
</p>
<p>
  "It is important to study the normal development of mammary tissue so that we can better understand what goes wrong in breast cancer," Silberstein said. "This is the kind of basic research that can lay the foundation for advances in cancer therapy."
</p>
<p>
  Compton attended UCSC as both an undergraduate and a graduate student, earning B.A. and Ph.D. degrees in molecular, cell, and developmental biology. Since completing her Ph.D. in 2003, she has done postdoctoral research with chemistry professor Phillip Crews. Crews's laboratory is exploring the pharmacological potential of compounds derived from marine sponges and other marine organisms. Some of the novel compounds they have isolated have shown promise as potential cancer therapies. Other researchers in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry are working to synthesize these natural compounds.
</p>
<p>
  "The search for new drugs and the effort to understand the molecular mechanisms that lead to cancer are complementary approaches that are both important," Compton said. "I feel fortunate to be getting experience doing both."
</p>
<p>
  Although researchers at UCSC do not conduct clinical studies involving patients, the campus is active in many areas of basic biomedical research. UCSC received more than $14 million in research funding from the National Institutes of Health last year, including grants to researchers in the Departments of Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology, Chemistry and Biochemistry, Environmental Toxicology, and Biomolecular Engineering.

        <title>Reaccreditation process served internal, external purposes</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 19 Sep 2005 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a><br>
<a href="mailto:ldonahue@ucsc.edu">Louise Donahue</a>
<p>
  UCSC's multiyear odyssey through the reaccreditation process was more than just an opportunity to showcase UCSC's strengths to the Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC), according to accreditation liaison officer William Ladusaw.
</p>
<p>
  "I think it allowed us to look seriously at some crucial issues," said Ladusaw, interim vice provost and dean of undergraduate education.
</p>
<p>
  Begun during Chancellor Greenwood's administration and culminating in the reaccreditation of the campus in June, the process prompted rethinking about everything from undergraduate retention to fundraising and educational accountability.
</p>
<p>
  Ladusaw noted that the reaccreditation process, which included visits in 2004 and 2005 by a team of eight distinguished academic administrators (see <a href="http://currents.ucsc.edu/04-05/01-31/wasc.asp">earlier Currents story</a>), provided valuable outside expertise and good advice.
</p>
<p>
  "The process couldn't have been better," said Senate chair and psychology professor Faye Crosby, describing it as "therapeutic." Crosby said Ladusaw focused on making the reaccreditation serve an internal as well as external purpose.
</p>
<p>
  In a June 30 letter to Chancellor Denice D. Denton announcing the reaccreditation, the WASC commission wrote that the process "confirmed the university's strengths, including high quality students and faculty, an emphasis on undergraduate teaching, a campus in a physically beautiful location, and a residential college system which promotes whole-person learning, all in the context of a major research university environment."
</p>
<p>
  The strong role of the faculty in the reaccreditation also received special attention.
</p>
<p>
  "The commission's report offered special commendation to the campus for the openness and willingness of the faculty to share, explore, and learn collaboratively about the educational effectiveness of our programs and campus life," Ladusaw said.
</p>
<p>
  A detailed list of recommendations was made by the Educational Effectiveness Review team in its <a href="http://planning.ucsc.edu/wasc/PDF/WASC_EEReview_2005.pdf">report</a> and several issues were highlighted in the commission's letter, including:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>* Graduation rate improvements.</strong> With 65 percent of students graduating within six years of enrollment, UCSC and UC Riverside have the lowest graduation rate among UC campuses (the UC average is 79 percent). "The commission believes that the University can and should do more to employ further institutional research to better understand and improve its graduation rates," the letter stated. The commission's point is "very valid," said Ladusaw. "It is something the campus will be looking at in the coming year. This is something the Senate is also interested in." Ladusaw explained that the problem at UCSC is mainly a problem of retention in the freshmen and sophomore years, and that the campus has indications the situation is already improving.
</p>
<p>
  * <strong>Increasing graduate programs/fundraising.</strong> Crosby said the commission's view was that "UCSC has a fine reputation for undergraduate education, but we can't rest on our laurels." The WASC letter urged the campus to consider expanding graduate programs and adding professional schools, an effort that is now moving forward. (See <a href="http://senate.ucsc.edu/ProfSchlProposals.pdf">request for proposals.)</a> The commission noted that these changes will require more resources. "The university seems well aware that in order to embark on these programs, it will need significant success with fundraising and grant-seeking," the commission said. More pointed comments on fundraising were made in the Educational Effectiveness Review, which urged the faculty to be more entrepreneurial in supplementing scarce state funds. "We need to think in new and creative ways," said Crosby. "To make all of this happen, we need to think outside the funding box." Crosby said the administration has already taken a step in the right direction by providing up to $45,000 in seed money so those working on the professional schools project can have a lighter course load or get a summer salary enhancement. "It's not that we have faculty that are averse to taking risks--you need to restructure the system so they won't hurt their careers," she said.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>* Continuing progress on accountability in student learning.</strong> The commission noted the varied ways UCSC assesses student learning and that UCSC is the only UC campus with a senior exit requirement for all students. UCSC's efforts to move toward more clearly defined learning objectives for each academic program were endorsed. Ladusaw said his "action item" from this part of the review is to get written learning objectives from each campus program.
</p>
<p>
  A progress report on the issues raised in the commission's letter is due by November 2010, and the first step in the next effort for reaccreditation will be due in 2013.
</p>
<p>
  All four-year colleges and universities in the United States must be reaccredited periodically to earn federal support for student scholarships, loans, and grants. One of six regional associations, WASC reviews educational institutions in California, Guam, and Hawaii. Its recommendations for accreditation are reported to the U.S. Department of Education.

<p>
  Since 2003, the UCSC Humanities Division's Teacher Scholar Program has offered a series of seminars each year to help local middle, junior, and high school teachers with curriculum enrichment.
</p>
<p>
  Presented in partnership with the Santa Cruz County Office of Education, the Salinas Union High School District, UCSC Extension, and the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation, the program allows teachers to explore a variety of subjects in a university setting.
</p>
<p>
  The seminars are led by UCSC professors and provide teachers with exposure to contemporary research in ways designed to enhance their teaching. There is no charge to teachers and a lunch is provided for the sessions, which are held on two separate days from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. Associate professor of history Alice Yang Murray kicks off the 2005-06 series on September 21 with a seminar titled "Memories of World War II in the U.S. and Japan."
</p>
<p>
  The program is the brainchild of history professor Gail Hershatter, the director of UCSC's Institute for Humanities Research, and associate professor of literature Christopher Connery. It is modeled after a program at Harvard University based on the idea of a humanities center that would serve public schoolteachers.
</p>
<p>
  "There are about 40 of these programs located around the country," noted Rebecca Woomer, a graduate student in literature who is the program administrator for UCSC's Humanities in the Schools program. "Right now, we have the only Teacher Scholar Program in California due to various budget constraints."
</p>
<p>
  Woomer added that the UCSC program gives humanities and social studies teachers the opportunity to come into contact with cutting-edge content in their fields, but lets them decide exactly how they want to translate that information into their classroom. And although the goal of the program is academic enrichment, a beneficial by-product is often lists of books and new resources for teachers and schools.
</p>
<p>
  "The Teacher Scholar Program gives teachers some great details and specifics that go beyond the normal survey textbook," said Woomer. "For example, history professor Bruce Levine gave a seminar last year about new ways of looking at the Civil War. He brought in a lot of primary sources such as newspapers, political cartoons, and editorials. As a result, a social studies resource teacher in Salinas is now using these primary sources in the schools. A class, for example, will study an actual newspaper cartoon of the time as a springboard for a discussion on what the attitudes of the day were."
</p>

        <title>UCSC will get training grants from California stem cell institute</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 19 Sep 2005 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>7393</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a><br>
<a href="mailto:ldonahue@ucsc.edu">Tim Stephens</a>
<p>
  <a name="OLE_LINK5" id="OLE_LINK5"></a>The California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (CIRM) last week announced its first grant awards, including a $1.2 million training grant to UCSC to establish a new training program in the systems biology of stem cells.
</p>
<p>
  The UCSC program will be part of a larger CIRM Training Program in Stem Cell Research, a three-year, $12.5 million program to train predoctoral, postdoctoral, and clinical fellows at 16 institutions across the state. The UCSC grant will fund the training of three predoctoral fellows (graduate students) and three postdoctoral fellows each year.
</p>
<p>
  The new program will draw from UCSC's strengths in computational genomics and basic biological research, providing fellows with a solid understanding of the biology of stem cells, the skills to use stem cells in their own research, and the ability to devise computational approaches and to integrate results from computational analyses into their own work. The program will underscore the value of stem cell research in developing therapies and cures for human disease.
</p>
<p>
  David Haussler, professor of biomolecular engineering and director of the Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering, will serve as program director. Trainees will receive guidance from faculty mentors with a range of expertise in areas critical for advancing stem cell research. Faculty mentors from the Department of Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology as well as the Baskin School of Engineering will be involved in the program.
</p>
<p>
  "This program reflects our commitment to interdisciplinary research and education at the interface of science and engineering, and it takes advantage of the fact that many of our faculty regularly work across the divisional boundaries," Haussler said.
</p>
<p>
  In addition to Haussler, the faculty mentors for the program will include Joshua Stuart and James Kent from the Department of Biomolecular Engineering; Michael Isaacson, professor and chair of electrical engineering; and Manuel Ares, Andrew Chisholm, David Feldheim, Lindsay Hinck, Yishi Jin, William Sullivan, John Tamkun, and Martha Zuniga from the Department of Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology.
</p>
<p>
  The program will include a broad range of courses designed to offer a comprehensive education in stem cell science and ethics. Several new courses are planned, including an ethics course that will explore fundamental questions about the ethical, legal, and social implications of stem cell research.
</p>
<p>
  The CIRM was established in 2004 with the passage of Proposition 71, the California Stem Cell Research and Cures Initiative. The statewide ballot measure provided $3 billion in funding for stem cell research at California universities and research institutions. Dispersal of these funds has been delayed, however, because lawsuits filed by opponents of the initiative currently prevent the CIRM from issuing bonds.
</p>
<p>
  As a result, CIRM will fund the new program through bond anticipation notes (BANs), a form of bridge financing, which are designed to be purchased by philanthropic individuals and institutions. The financing team of the Independent Citizens' Oversight Committee (ICOC) plans to proceed with the first BANs issuance for this program in October.
</p>
<p>
  "This is an exciting moment for the CIRM as these awards mark the first step in our scientific program of stem cell research--an accomplishment we have been able to achieve in less than one year as a state agency. The CIRM training program established today will be the most comprehensive training program to date in the field," said CIRM president Zach Hall. "It will provide a pipeline of highly trained basic and clinical investigators for the research that CIRM will fund in California."
</p>

</p>
<p>
  UCSC's leadership in French-intensive gardening was front and center in a recent <i>Mother Earth News</i> article, which highlighted Alan Chadwick's creation of what is now the <b>Alan Chadwick Garden</b>.
</p>
<p>
  In a Sunday feature about the local food-and-farm scene, the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> dubbed the <b>Center for Agroecology & Sustainable Food Systems</b> the "local granddaddy of slow food." The Center for Agroecology also received laurels in a <i>WireTap</i> piece that appeared on AlterNet about alternatives to the corporate-dominated food system.
</p>
<p>
  The <i>Monterey County Herald</i>'s announcement of the new Ed.D. program prompted a flurry of calls from interested prospective students.

        <title>McHenry Library Addition to provide major increase in space, new features</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 19 Sep 2005 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>7388</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_7387" align="alignright" width="230"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/09/library.05-09-19.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7387" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/09/library.05-09-19.jpg" alt="This drawing from BOORA Architects Inc. shows the view of the completed library project from the southwest." width="230" height="150" /></a>This drawing from BOORA Architects Inc. shows the view of the completed library project from the southwest.[/caption]
<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  After 10 years of planning, the McHenry Library Addition and Renovation Project will take a a giant step toward reality when construction begins this fall.
</p>
<p>
  "We are very excited about the project," said Acting University Librarian Bob White. "The Addition and Renovation Project will provide the campus with a 21st-century library and state-of-the-art research facility to support the instructional and research needs of UC Santa Cruz students and faculty."
</p>
<p>
  To better serve library users, space at McHenry Library will be expanded by nearly 72 per cent, adding approximately 81,600 assignable square feet to the existing 114,000-square-foot library.
</p>
<p>
  It will offer an array of features, including:
</p>
<p>
  * An electronic research center with 60 electronic stations to access library resources.<br>
  <br>
  * A visual resource center, providing access to electronic graphic files and image banks, 35 mm slides, and historic collections in various photographic formats.<br>
  <br>
  * An instructional design center to help faculty make innovative use of technology in instruction and research.<br>
  <br>
  * A "cyber study" room and cafe--an Internet cafe providing social gathering space and online access.
</p>
<p>
  * Distance-learning facilities, providing support for students and faculty at remote locations, such as Silicon Valley.
</p>
<p>
  * A film and music center, providing access to a wide range of nonprint media, including video and audio recordings, CD-ROMs, and DVDs.
</p>
<p>
  Construction will take about four years to complete, and will be done in two phases. The first phase, the addition to the existing building, will take two years, opening in 2007. The second phase, the renovation and earthquake retrofitting of the existing part of building, will also take two years, and is scheduled to open in 2009. The library will remain open throughout both phases.
</p>
<p>
  "The new McHenry Library will also provide expanded, up-to-date facilities for Special Collections," White said. "In addition, compact shelving will be utilized to more effectively store print materials, and library users will be able to connect to the campus network throughout the building by using the campus's wireless network."
</p>
<p>
  There will also be additional electronic workstations and a number of group study rooms to foster collaborative learning.
</p>
<p>
  Despite all the changes, White emphasized that the look of the library will not be diminished. "The expanded and renovated McHenry Library will retain the building's distinctive architecture and the spacious entryways and patios that are so much a part of UCSC life. "
</p>
<p>
  White also noted that the project will continue the campus's historical incorporation of the natural environment into facilities planning.
</p>
<p>
  "The project has been very carefully planned so the library will continue to be surrounded by trees," he said. "The landscaping plan includes new plantings of coast redwoods, flowering cherry trees, and coast live oaks. On the south side of the new McHenry Library there will be reading gardens where students and faculty can enjoy the natural beauty of the campus and access the campus network."
</p>
<p>
  In addition, White said, "there will be a terraced 'great lawn,' which will serve as a place to enjoy the outside ambience of the campus and also serve as a place for community and special events."
</p>
<p>
  Considerable efforts were made to protect as many trees as possible at the construction site, said Josephine Ortega, associate architect in Physical Planning and Construction. The impact on animals in the area was also taken into account, she said. The project's consulting biologist required that trees not be removed right away after they were cut. Instead, the cut trees were left on the ground for 24 hours to allow bats and other wildlife living in the trees to go elsewhere. Earlier, the biologist had made sure there were no endangered or protected species threatened by the construction.
</p>
<p>
  Some of the tree stumps and trees removed at the site will find new use as part of a stream restoration project on the Carmel River in Monterey County. The campus has been involved in ongoing restoration projects on the river, working with public agencies as well as the Carmel River Steelhead Association to help create fish habitat for sensitive aquatic species.

        <title>Three universities collaborate to offer new doctorate for professional educators</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 19 Sep 2005 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>

        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a><br>
<a href="mailto:jmcnulty@ucsc.edu">Jennifer McNulty</a>
<p>
  <a name="OLE_LINK5" id="OLE_LINK5"></a>Ten students have begun a new doctoral program in educational leadership offered jointly by UC Santa Cruz; San Jose State University; and California State University, Monterey Bay.
</p>
<p>
  The UC Regents approved the new Doctor of Education Degree (Ed.D.) in Collaborative Leadership this summer. It has been in development for five years, said June Gordon, associate professor of education at UCSC and lead coordinator for the Santa Cruz campus.
</p>
<p>
  "This degree is geared toward working professionals," said Gordon. "The goal is to prepare K-12 educators to lead educational transformation in the culturally and linguistically diverse schools of the region that encompasses Monterey, San Benito, Santa Clara, and Santa Cruz Counties."
</p>
<p>
  Among those enrolled this fall is Ralph Porras, assistant superintendent of Santa Cruz City Schools and the former principal of Santa Cruz High School and DeLaveaga School.
</p>
<p>
  Students will take two courses per quarter year-round for three years. Classes will be offered at each of the three campuses on a rotating basis. The first courses were held at UCSC this summer; this fall, classes will be held at CSUMB, while winter and spring classes will take place on the San Jose campus; next summer, classes will again be held at UCSC. Participating campus units are the Education Department at UCSC, the College of Education at SJSU, and the College of Professional Studies at CSUMB.
</p>
<p>
  The Ed.D. is geared toward practical, professional work, and dissertations are expected to have practical implications. "Students are expected to bring research topics to the table," said Gordon, adding that current topics include how to help second-language learners access quality education, how to respond to the demands of government policies and reforms, and how to increase the participation of low-income parents in educational decision making.
</p>
<p>
  The three-campus collaboration offers students the benefits of both the UC and CSU system, said Gordon.
</p>
<p>
  "San Jose State has tremendous strength in educational leadership, with an enormous teacher education program and strong roots in the community," said Gordon. "CSUMB brings a focus on interdisciplinary work, more theoretical faculty interests, and a great deal of enthusiasm about working with underserved students in the Seaside, Salinas, and Watsonville communities." UCSC professors offer research expertise and a focus on international populations and learning.
</p>
<p>
  Each quarter, the two classes offered will be taught by instructors affiliated with different institutions. Twelve core faculty members, with four representatives from each campus, will provide the bulk of instruction. At UCSC, core faculty include Gordon and education professors Rodney Ogawa, Lucinda Pease-Alvarez, and Gordon Wells.

<p>
  Campus cook Bruce Holgers was prepared to write a check, but before he knew it, he was on a plane to Louisiana to help feed the survivors of Hurricane Katrina.
</p>
<p>
  Holgers had contacted the American Red Cross about making a cash donation, but when officials learned he was a cook, they had a bigger donation in mind. Holgers cancelled his two-week vacation, enrolled in a condensed training course, and flew to Baton Rouge on September 5.
</p>
<p>
  "We were like an ice cream truck, driving around the neighborhoods with corned beef hash," recalled Holgers, a senior cook at the Crown-Merrill Dining Hall. "We offered meals and information, and we listened to stories. We were the mobile food supplier and the mobile hand-holders."
</p>
<p>
  Holgers worked primarily in Slidell, across Lake Pontchartrain from New Orleans. "The flood water had receded, but there were wires down all over the place, and pine trees had just smashed through homes and automobiles," he said. Household appliances and possessions were piled in the streets.
</p>
<p>
  Holgers was struck by the Southern hospitality that greeted him everywhere. "Everyone was extraordinarily grateful--especially when they heard we'd come from California, Michigan, Indiana, Massachusetts," he said. "As a Northerner, I'm not used to being called, 'Sir.' I did not hear one discouraging word."
</p>
<p>
  In addition, relief workers formed tight bonds. "There was the work we did, the misery we saw, and our efforts to alleviate that misery," he said. "And there was the fun and camaraderie we had at the same time--it was like being at camp. It was a saintly collection of people."
</p>
<p>
  On campus, Chancellor Denton <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/katrina/committee-letter.pdf">established a committee</a> to oversee UCSC's response to the disaster. In Student Affairs, staff are helping students who had planned to attend college in the Gulf Coast region. As of September 14, UCSC had extended offers of admission to 25 students from the devasted area.
</p>
<p>
  Laurie Scolari, associate director of the Educational Partnership Center, was touched by the generosity of her colleagues, who rallied to fill backpacks with school supplies, toys, and other goodies for Katrina victims. Scolari initially purchased 20 knapsacks but ended up shipping 89 loaded backpacks to Baton Rouge, many bearing UCSC t-shirts and slug mascot items purchased by her EPC coworkers.
</p>
<p>
  "I'm always amazed by my EPC colleagues' kind hearts professionally and personally," said Scolari, who worked with Operation Ryan's Hope, a local nonprofit that is shipping supplies to the storm-devastated region.
</p>
<p>
  At the Bay Tree Bookstore, customers may make a donation to the American Red Cross' Katrina relief efforts <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/katrina/bookstore.html">when they make a purchase</a>.
</p>
<p>
  In the Community Studies Department, field-study coordinator Michael Rotkin is organizing internships for UCSC students who want to work with relief agencies in the hurricane-stricken region. Students will receive academic credit for their contributions and should contact Rotkin at (831) 459-4601 or via e-mail at <a href="mailto:openup@ucsc.edu">openup@ucsc.edu</a> for more information.
</p>
<p>
  Faculty have shared their expertise with reporters covering the hurricane and its aftermath, as well. Professor emeritus of psychology Elliot Aronson was quoted in a <i>New York Times</i> story about the <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/katrina/crime.html">breakdown of social order</a> that followed the flooding of New Orleans.
</p>
<p>
  ''Our experiments have shown that you can get people to commit immoral acts one step at a time,'' Aronson told the newspaper in an e-mail interview. ''People who would never dream of stealing a TV set might be inclined to do so if they first stole some water, bread, cereal, milk, and so on.''
</p>
<p>
  Reporters with the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> and <i>Sacramento Bee</i> contacted David Wellman, professor of community studies, regarding the ways <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/katrina/race.html">race emerged as an issue</a> in hurricane response efforts and media coverage of the disaster.
</p>
<p>
  "Many whites will focus on the lawlessness of what's going on in New Orleans," Wellman told the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>. "Many blacks will focus on the desperation of the victims, the fact that they're being neglected and ignored."
</p>
<p>
  Wellman said the nation's racial fault lines operate like geological fault lines: "They're invisible until there's an earthquake," he told the paper.
</p>
<p>
  The theme emerged in Wellman's comments to the <i>Sacramento Bee</i>.
</p>
<p>
  "One of the things these so-called natural disasters do is they make visible things that are normally invisible," he told the <i>Bee</i>. "What is being made visible as a result of the storm is the invisibility and the vulnerability of black Americans."
</p>
<p>
  Finally, politics professor Daniel Wirls helped the <i>San Jose Mercury News</i> sort out the political fallout for President Bush of his handling of the disaster. "All of a sudden, some of their agenda just doesn't seem to fit the reality of what's going on in this country," Wirls said of the Bush administration and its focus on tax breaks, domestic spending cuts, and the war in Iraq.

        <title>UCSC raises record $35.3 million in private gifts</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 19 Sep 2005 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>

        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a><br>
<a href="mailto:ldonahue@ucsc.edu">Louise Donahue</a>
<p>
  <a name="OLE_LINK5" id="OLE_LINK5"></a><a name="OLE_LINK6" id="OLE_LINK6">Led by grants promoting ocean research and drawing on strong support from alumni, private gifts to UC Santa Cruz reached $35.3 million during 2004-05.</a>
</p>
<p>
  "Across the range of disciplines, from social sciences, humanities, and the physical and biological sciences to arts and engineering, our donors are making a positive difference at UC Santa Cruz," said Chancellor Denice D. Denton. "We depend on their generosity and support, and are very grateful for it."
</p>
<p>
  The total amount raised--a record for the campus--marked an increase of nearly 10 percent from the 2003-04 year.
</p>
<p>
  Drawing the largest share of private support was a long-term collaborative research project studying and monitoring coastal ecosystems. The Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation and the David and Lucile Packard Foundation together contributed more than $7 million to UC Santa Cruz for its role in the Partnership for Interdiscplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans.
</p>
<p>
  Ocean research was the goal of another gift by the Moore Foundation, $4.1 million to establish a Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation Investigator in Marine Science. The investigator, professor of ocean sciences Jonathan Zehr, has done groundbreaking research on microorganisms that "fertilize" the oceans by converting nitrogen gas into a form that other organisms can use (a process called nitrogen fixation). The Moore Foundation also gave $650,647 for a multidisciplinary project to determine the number and distribution of predators in the open ocean.
</p>
<p>
  The largest single contribution was the $6.5 million in-kind gift from Texas Instruments of a large industrial facility and the 18.5-acre site surrounding it. The building, in Santa Cruz near the array of campus research facilities at Long Marine Laboratory, is well suited for classrooms, laboratories, and offices.
</p>
<p>
  Foundation trustee Kit Mura-smith, who came to the campus as a re-entry student, contributed the largest single amount ever from a UC Santa Cruz graduate. Her $1.4 million charitable trust will be split between scholarships for re-entry students and the McHenry Library, the campus's main library.
</p>
<p>
  Alumni support was impressive throughout the campus, with more than $1.7 million in reunion giving. Alumni also contributed $709,858 of the more than $2.7 million given to the Annual Fund. The Telephone Outreach Program, which contacts alumni as well as students' parents, raised nearly $1.2 million, a record for the second year in a row.
</p>
<p>
  UC Santa Cruz Foundation trustees contributed more than $2.5 million to the campus.
</p>
<p>
  <a name="OLE_LINK17" id="OLE_LINK17"></a><a name="OLE_LINK18" id="OLE_LINK18">McHenry Library drew support from many other sources, including $500,000 from the late Miller and Bunny Outcalt for the library's photography archives, and $150,000 from Professor Emerita Melanie J. Mayer to support local history research in Special Collections.</a>
</p>
<p>
  The Jack Baskin School of Engineering's Storage Systems Research Center received $1 million from Kumar Malavalli, cofounder of Brocade Communications and cofounder and CEO of InMage Systems, to establish the Kumar Malavalli Endowed Chair in Storage Systems Research.
</p>
<p>
  Two of the campus's community collaborations for promoting educational achievement, economic equity, and environmental justice received nearly $1 million from the W. H. Kellogg Foundation. The Bridging Multiple Worlds Alliance and the Center for Justice, Tolerance, and Community will share the $978,125 grant.
</p>
<p>
  The New Teacher Center's programs around the nation for new teachers and administrators drew grants of $306,296 from the Stupski Foundation and $300,000 from the Goldman Sachs Foundation.

<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  Students began moving into university housing over the weekend in anticipation of the 2005-06 school year.
</p>
<p>
  The first day of instruction in the fall quarter is Thursday, September 22.
</p>
<p>
  Here are some facts and figures about this year's student body, new academic programs the campus is offering, changes in parking regulations, and new buildings under construction:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Enrollment</strong>
</p>
<p>
  UCSC is expecting an average 2005-06 enrollment of 14,995 students; the projection for the fall quarter alone, historically the quarter with the most students, is 15,510.
</p>
<p>
  Of those students enrolling in the fall, 14,010 are expected to be undergraduates; 1,500 are projected to enroll in graduate studies. Of the 14,010 undergraduates expected to enroll, approximately 4,050 will be new students (3,100 freshmen and 950 transfer students). These 4,050 new undergraduates were admitted from among nearly 23,000 applicants to UCSC.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Profile of new freshmen</strong>
</p>
<p>
  The most popular majors among freshmen who have already declared are in the many areas of the biological sciences, in business economics, and in psychology.
</p>
<p>
  Approximately half of the freshmen have declared a major. The other half have expressed interest in a more general academic area of interest, having selected one of the following clusters: business and economics; education; environmental sciences; human psychology, culture, and society; information sciences, engineering, and technology; languages, literatures, and communication; liberal arts and area studies; life and health sciences; physical sciences and math; and visual and performing arts and media.
</p>
<p>
  Of the 3,100 freshmen expected, more than 1,200 (39 percent) identified themselves as African American, Chicano, Latino, American Indian, or Asian/Asian American. The average grade-point average (G.P.A.) of admitted freshmen is 3.69.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Academic changes</strong>
</p>
<p>
  * The Education Department has added an Ed.D. in collaborative leadership (with San Jose State University and California State University, Monterey Bay)
</p>
<p>
  <strong>*</strong> The name of the B.A. program in "women's studies" has been changed to "feminist studies."
</p>
<p>
  * Film and Digital Media has added a B.A. concentration in critical studies
</p>
<p>
  * The Jack Baskin School of Engineering--Applied Mathematics and Statistics has added a new undergraduate minor in statistics
</p>
<p>
  * The Jack Baskin School of Engineering--Computer Engineering has added a new undergraduate minor in computer technology, and new B.S. concentrations in computer systems, digital hardware, multimedia systems, networks, and systems programming.
</p>
<p>
  * Latin American and Latino Studies/Literature has added a new B.A. combined major.
</p>
<p>
  * The name of the music undergraduate minor has been changed to "Western art music"
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Parking changes</strong>
</p>
<p>
  The new academic year also brings some changes in parking regulations. Nighttime parking permits are now required on campus, as of September 1, and some parking fees have increased.
</p>
<p>
  Metro bus passes will remain free to those faculty and staff who do not purchase any type of parking permit. Those who wish to receive a bus pass in addition to their parking permit or scratch-off packet, however, will need to pay an additional $24 for their annual bus pass, a payroll deduction of $2 per month.
</p>
<p>
  More information is available at <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/taps%20">www2.ucsc.edu/taps</a> and in a July 25 <i>Currents Online</i> article, "<a href="http://currents.ucsc.edu/05-06/07-25/taps.asp">Nighttime parking, other parking changes near<strong>."</strong></a>
</p>
<p>
  <strong>New buildings</strong>
</p>
<p>
  A number of construction projects are under way on campus and will continue through much of the 2005-06 academic year. The projects include:
</p>
<p>
  * McHenry Library Expansion: After 10 years of planning, the McHenry Library Addition and Renovation Project will take a giant step toward reality as construction begins this fall. The expanded and renovated McHenry Library will provide increased space to better serve library users. Site preparation began last week with ground clearing in or very near the project footprint. The project, scheduled for completion in 2009, will provide the campus with an outstanding, architecturally designed building in a setting of terraced reading gardens, redwoods, and cherry trees. (See <a href="http://currents.ucsc.edu/05-06/09-19/library.asp">Currents article</a>)
</p>
<p>
  * Kerr Hall: To prepare for the relocation of administrative offices resulting from the McHenry Library project, construction is occurring on Kerr Hall's interior and in its parking area. The relocation of offices is scheduled to take place by the beginning of January.
</p>
<p>
  Other projects include the Emergency Response Center, the Hahn Student Services retrofit project, the Humanities and Social Sciences Facility, and the Physical Sciences Building. Details on construction projects throughout campus are available online on the <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/about/construction/">Construction Plans web page</a>.

        <title>Campus takes steps to help with 'transformations' communication</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 19 Sep 2005 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>

<p>
  UC Santa Cruz is currently undergoing a variety of transformations in the way it does business--how purchasing is managed, the process for hiring, the collection and retrieval of students' academic information, etc. In order to help ensure that faculty and staff can access support for questions involved with these transformation projects, two new sources of information have been established through the Office of the Executive Vice Chancellor.
</p>
<p>
  The first is a website, <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/transformations/">www.ucsc.edu/transformations</a>. At this site, you will find background information on the many important transformation projects, and there are direct links to the different online resources that each transformation project has established to offer help with problems or questions.
</p>
<p>
  Additionally, a Transformation Referral Line has been established. That telephone number is 459-1999. The Referral Line is answered from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday, and is a temporary service that has been set up during the changes taking place on campus. Referral Line staff will connect you with the appropriate Help Desk on campus or, if you have already contacted a Help Desk, the Referral Line staff can connect you with other people on campus who have access to the information you need.

<p>
  The restaurant at the University Center has a new name and new management. UC Dining Services took over management from Sodexho in June and renamed the restaurant Terra Fresca to reflect the new emphasis on fresh local foods.
</p>
<p>
  Restaurant staff spent the summer testing the menu, creating a more warm and inviting space, tightening procedures to quicken service time, and training staff, according to Julie Mitravich, head of operations and events at the restaurant.
</p>
<p>
  Terra Fresca is open for lunch Monday through Friday, from 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. Over the summer, while staff were fine tuning the menu and operations, they offered a buffet lunch one day a week. It was so popular that they decided to make it a regular Friday feature this fall.
</p>
<p>
  "The buffet is popular because it is a great value, with a large variety of choices. People can pace their lunch on their own timeline," said Mitravich.
</p>
<p>
  Focusing on fresh, organic, and sustainable foods from Santa Cruz and the Central Coast region, the menu includes a selection of appetizers, soups, salads, sandwiches, entrees, and desserts, along with daily specials and a fresh catch of the day.
</p>
<p>
  Terra Fresca's staff is headed by Mitravich and chef Greg Kuhn. The staff also includes sous chef Chris Wenger, line/pastry cooks Luis Fernando and Doug George, busser/dishwasher Miguel Cisneros, and daily operations coordinator Josh Martin.

        <title>Lucinda Pease-Alvarez joins innovative teacher-prep effort</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 19 Sep 2005 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>7372</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  Lucinda Pease-Alvarez, an associate professor of education at UCSC, is one of 17 educators around the country named to an innovative project that will develop a "virtual apprenticeship" for novice teachers.
</p>
<p>
  The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching has selected Pease-Alvarez and 16 others as the first Goldman-Carnegie Quest Fellows, charged with developing new tools for teaching. The fellows will document the work of accomplished classroom teachers and showcase their practice in multimedia products that will help student teachers learn from veteran teachers. Pease-Alvarez and her peers will integrate these new materials into their courses as alternative texts and materials.
</p>
<p>
  By documenting the work of classroom teachers and teacher educators like Pease-Alvarez, the Quest Project is committed to making the practice of K-12 teaching--and the preparation of novice teachers--public. Multimedia materials will help students connect theory and practice, and understand the hard work that goes into making good teaching look easy.
</p>
<p>
  Materials gathered by Pease-Alvarez and other fellows will be evaluated by the Carnegie Foundation, which will develop an interactive gallery and library archive. Educators will be able to follow individual cases from the originating K-12 classroom, through their use in colleges and university professional schools, and ultimately to their application in the classrooms of new teachers.
</p>
<p>
  Joining Pease-Alvarez as Goldman-Carnegie Quest Fellows are teacher educators affiliated with Stanford University, UC Berkeley, Mills College, San Jose State University, Sonoma State University, Brandeis University, City College of New York, the University of Pennsylvania, and Teachers College, Columbia University.
</p>
<p>
  The Quest Project is supported jointly by $3 million from the Richard and Rhoda Goldman Fund and the Carnegie Foundation. The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, located in Stanford, California, is an independent policy and research center dedicated to doing "all things necessary to encourage, uphold, and dignify the profession of the teacher and the cause of higher education." The Richard and Rhoda Goldman Fund is a private, charitable, family foundation that supports nonprofit organizations that enhance the quality of life, primarily in the San Francisco Bay Area.

        <title>Attention students! Participants in transition-to-college study needed</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 19 Sep 2005 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  Three years ago, psychology professor Margarita Azmitia began an in-depth study of first-year college students for the University of California. She and her research team interviewed about 200 first-year UCSC students as part of what has been dubbed the "transition-to college" study. Now, Azmitia is trying to find those same students--seniors, now--to interview one more time before they graduate.
</p>
<p>
  "Our last interviews were during their sophomore year, so many e-mails and phone numbers are no longer correct," said Azmitia. "The challenge is finding them."
</p>
<p>
  By posting flyers around campus and asking professors to announce her search in classes, Azmitia hopes to get word of the study to the students who participated during their first year. Each participant will receive $40 for the two-hour follow-up session.
</p>
<p>
  The results of the study will help shape university policies and programs aimed at retention and academic success.
</p>
<p>
  "The transition to college is exciting, but it can be stressful, as well," said Azmitia, a developmental psychologist who specializes in educational transitions. "The university wants to do as much as it can to support students while they're here."
</p>
<p>
  Early results indicated that about 15 percent of participants were struggling academically and that homesickness was a bigger problem than many students anticipated. Although the participants are UCSC students, the results will be used throughout the UC system.
</p>
<p>
  With initial funding from the UC All Campus Consortium On Research for Diversity (UC/ACCORD), UCSC's Academic Senate Committee on Research, and the UCSC Social Sciences Division, Azmitia secured additional grant support to follow the students throughout their college years. Her research team includes postdoctoral and doctoral students, as well as 15 undergraduate researchers.

<p>
  Linguistics professor Geoffrey Pullum has been selected as a 2005-06 fellow by the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study. He is one of 51 people selected for the yearlong fellowship. While at Radcliffe, the fellows--among them 10 creative artists, 16 humanists, 13 social scientists, and 12 scientists working on projects ranging from issues in higher education, to cancer treatments, to installation art on the theme of loss--will work individually and across disciplines on projects chosen both for quality and long-term impact.
</p>
<p>
  Pullum will work with James Rogers, a computational and mathematical linguist and a professor of computer science at Earlham College, and Barbara Scholz, a philosopher of language and lecturer in philosophy at San Jose State University, to complete a book, "New Logical Foundations for Linguistics," on model-theoretic syntax, a new framework for linguistic theory grounded in formal logic and applied to problems in syntactic theories.

<p>
  New provosts have been named for Kresge College and Merrill College, and the provost at Oakes College has been reappointed for another three-year term.
</p>
<p>
  Micah Perks and Juan Poblete, both associate professors of literature, were appointed to a three-year term as joint provosts at Kresge College. Perks is codirector, with Karen Yamashita, of the Creative Writing Program, which each quarter brings eight to 10 visiting authors and poets into UCSC classrooms. Perks's books include a memoir, <i>Pagan Time: An American Childhood</i> (2001); and a novel of historic fiction, <i>We Are Gathered Here</i> (1996); as well as short stories that have appeared in numerous anthologies and literary magazines. She came to UC Santa Cruz in 1997.
</p>
<p>
  Poblete's focus is on Latin American and U.S. Latino cultures. He is the author of <i>Nineteenth Century Chilean Literature: Between Reading Publics and Authorial Figures</i>, published in Spanish in 2003, and the editor of <i>Critical Latin American and Latino Studies</i> (2003). In 2004 he was a co-organizer of an international conference held at UCSC, "Reflections on the Future: Hemispheric Dialogues on the Intersections of Latina/o-Chicana/o-Latin American(s) Studies." Participants from Chile, Brazil, Puerto Rico, and Argentina were among those attending. Poblete joined the faculty at UC Santa Cruz in 1997.
</p>
<p>
  Lourdes Martinez-Echazabal, associate professor of literature, was appointed to a three-year term as Merrill College provost. Martinez-Echazabal's work examines race and ethnicity in Latin America. She was the author of <i>Para una Semiotica de la Mulatez</i> (Towards a Semiotics of Mulatto Identity) in 1990 and the editor of a special issue of the <i>Afro Hispanic Review</i> in 2005 dedicated to Afro-Cuban writer Manuel Granados. She has published widely on topics pertaining to Latin American and Caribbean literatures; comparative Afro-Latin American literatures; Brazilian literature and cultures; and Latin American women writers. She is the founder and coordinator of the Cuba in Americas and Transatlantic Contexts research cluster at UCSC. She has been on the faculty since 1990.
</p>
<p>
  Pedro Castillo, associate professor of history, has been reappointed to an additional three-year term at Oakes College. Castillo was named by President Clinton in 1999 to serve on the 26-member National Council on the Humanities, the advisory board of the National Endowment for the Humanities. His research interests include Mexican American social history and race, class, and gender in California history. His most recent book is <i>The American Nation</i>, a textbook on American history for use in middle schools. He is very active in the Santa Cruz community and is on the Board of Trustees of the Community Foundation of Santa Cruz County. Castillo has been on the UCSC faculty for nearly 30 years.
</p>
<p>
  "The other college provosts and I look forward to working with our new colleagues," said William Ladusaw, interim vice provost and dean of undergraduate education, in announcing the appointments. "Their enthusiasm and fresh perspectives will continue the work of their predecessors in renewing the colleges' mission to support undergraduates and enrich the campus educational environment."

        <title>UCSC team to share environmental justice expertise with state air board</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 05 Sep 2005 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_7390" align="alignright" width="220"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/09/pastor_m.05-09-05.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7390" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/09/pastor_m.05-09-05.jpg" alt="Manuel Pastor Photo: Ben Balagot" width="220" height="234" /></a>Manuel Pastor Photo: Ben Balagot[/caption]

<p>
  Environmental justice researchers are at the forefront of efforts to evaluate the risks posed by air pollution, particularly the disproportionate risks faced by residents of low-income and minority neighborhoods.
</p>
<p>
  So it's good news that Manuel Pastor, professor of Latin American and Latino studies at UCSC and a leading researcher in the field of environmental justice, will head up a team that will share its expertise with the California Air Resources Board (CARB).
</p>
<p>
  With a grant for nearly $700,000, Pastor and colleagues James Sadd of Occidental College and Rachel Morello-Frosch of Brown University will work toward improving the way the state integrates environmental justice issues into its work on air quality. The board needs to expand its scope to incorporate the cumulative impacts of air pollution exposure and socioeconomic vulnerability into its regulatory decision making, said Pastor.
</p>
<p>
  "Environmental justice has become a major policy issue in California, but there are gaps in the way the state conducts research," said Pastor. "We can help develop rigorous, trustworthy, and cost-efficient methodologies to identify and assist vulnerable communities."
</p>
<p>
  Based on evidence that environmental hazards are concentrated in poor and minority neighborhoods, environmental justice advocates seek redress for victims who suffer disproportionate exposure to hazardous substances such as toxic waste, air pollution, and industrial runoff. Pastor and his team have developed innovative measures of exposure and effect that they are eager to share. An interagency group is currently developing environmental justice implementation guidelines for the California Environmental Protection Agency.
</p>
<p>
  "This is the time to work at the state level," added Pastor, codirector of UCSC's Center for Justice, Tolerance, and Community.
</p>
<p>
  Specifically, the CARB grant will enable Pastor's team to fill some of the data-gathering and analytical gaps faced by state regulators. Pastor and his colleagues will conduct statewide and regional studies to identify the key factors that explain existing patterns of racial and ethnic disparities in lifetime cancer and other health risks associated with outdoor air toxics exposure.
</p>
<p>
  Those results will help Pastor develop measures of cumulative impact and community vulnerability at the neighborhood level, with an eye toward guiding policy regarding protection, community participation, and educational outreach about air pollution. The project will also include a community-based "validation study" in the Oakland area to identify sources of emissions that may have gone undetected by CARB.
</p>
<p>
  Community participation is essential, according to Pastor, who said it builds trust in the process and the final outcome. He also noted that tools developed by outside researchers to assess environmental equity will be useful to state agencies as they respond to community concerns.
</p>

<a href="mailto:ldonahue@ucsc.edu">Louise Donahue</a>
<p>
  <a name="OLE_LINK6" id="OLE_LINK6">Relocation of several campus operations to the west side of Santa Cruz is moving into high gear this month.</a>
</p>
<p>
  Approximately 175 employees are expected to move into 2300 Delaware, the former Texas Instruments facility, with another 34 planning to move into University Business Park at 2801 Mission Street Extension and the Staff HR Buildings at 2901 Mission Street Extension during September, October, and November.
</p>
<p>
  The moves are part of UCSC's West Side Relocation Project, which includes consolidation of service centers into several leased and owned buildings on the west side of Santa Cruz. The relocation project, in turn, is part of the campuswide Business and Information Technology Transformation Programs.
</p>
<p>
  "This relocation creates much-needed release space on campus for instructional and research activities. In addition, the moves will create a synergistic hub for Business and Administrative Services and provide space for ITS consolidation" said Linda Flaherty, who is coordinating the moves. Flaherty is the assistant director of capital planning and space management.
</p>
<p>
  Roof repairs, seismic improvements, and upgrades to conform with the Americans with Disabilities Act were among renovations needed to prepare the facility for UCSC staff members, Flaherty said.
</p>
<p>
  Renovation of the office wing is just the first step in UCSC's use of the facility. The next step is to begin the planning process for the future development of the former fabrication facility known as Building C. Currently, the building is being used for storage, Flaherty said.
</p>
<p>
  The moves will involve various campus units and begin this week:
</p>
<p>
  * On September 9, staff members in Purchasing will be consolidating staff into 2300 Delaware and the University Business Services Business Office will also move to that site. The telephone numbers for both will remain the same, and the mail stops will be "Purchasing" and "UBS Business Office."
</p>
<p>
  * Also on September 9, Staff Human Resources will be consolidating staff into the Staff Human Resources Buildings at 2901 Mission Street. The staff members moving first will be those serving ITS and Business and Administrative Services. The main phone number of (831) 459-2009 remains the same; a list of individual phone numbers is available online at <a href="http://bas.ucsc.edu/btp/SHR_bas-its.pdf">http://bas.ucsc.edu/btp/SHR_bas-its.pdf</a>. The new mail stop is "SHR Service Teams."
</p>
<p>
  * Information Technology Services (ITS) will be consolidating staff at 2300 Delaware as part of the Information Technology Transformation Program. Staff members will make the move on September 16 and September 30. Questions may be directed to (831) 459-1660. The mail stop will be ITS Delaware.
</p>
<p>
  * The Financial Affairs Department will be consolidating the Controller's Office, Accounting, and the new Financial Administrative Services Transaction (FAST) Office into 2300 Delaware. The pilot FAST and Accounts Payable will move September 9, with the rest of the FAST staff moving September 30. Financial Information Systems (FIS) staff will move to 2300 Delaware September 16. The remaining Accounting Office staff, Payroll Personnel System Office, Campus Controller's Office, and the manager of Student Business Services staff will move on October 14. Two mail stops will be used. Mail to staff in the FAST Office should be addressed to "FAST Office." Mail to staff in the Accounting Office, including Payroll, Accounts Payable, Extramural Funds Accounting, FIS, PPS, and the Campus Controller's Office should be addressed to "Accounting Office."

<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  Predicting the magnetic behavior of metallic compounds is a surprisingly difficult problem for theoretical physicists.
</p>
<p>
  While the properties of a common refrigerator magnet are not a great mystery, certain materials exhibit magnetic properties that do not fit within existing theories of magnetism.
</p>
<p>
  One such material inspired a recent theoretical breakthrough by UCSC physicists.
</p>
<p>
  In a paper published in the August 19 issue of the journal <i>Physical Review Letters,</i> Sriram Shastry, a professor of physics, and graduate student Jan Haerter describe "kinetic antiferromagnetism," a new mechanism for metallic magnetism in materials with a particular type of atomic lattice structure. The paper solves a problem that has stumped theoretical physicists for decades.
</p>
<p>
  "New materials tend to drive theoretical advances," Shastry said. "Metallic magnetism is a real frontier field in theoretical physics, and it has practical applications in materials science."
</p>
<p>
  Superconductors, magnetic storage devices (such as computer hard drives), and other applications are among the areas in which theoretical advances in metallic magnetism could play an important role.
</p>
<p>
  Shastry and Haerter were interested in the unusual magnetic behavior of sodium cobalt oxide, a material first described in 1997 and intensively studied in recent years. The material can be made with variable amounts of sodium ions sandwiched between layers of cobalt oxide. The cobalt atoms form a triangular lattice structure that gives rise to "electronic frustration," which refers to the inability of the electrons in the system to achieve a single state that minimizes their total energy.
</p>
<p>
  A landmark in the theoretical understanding of why certain metals are ferromagnetic--known as the Nagaoka-Thouless theorem--was achieved in the mid-1960s, but only applies to materials with an unfrustrated lattice structure. The frustrated case has remained unsolved for the past 40 years.
</p>
<p>
  "This problem has been a tough nut to crack. We were able to make some progress and came up with a surprising result," Shastry said.
</p>
<p>
  The magnetic properties of metals result from the configuration of the spins of electrons. Electron spin is a quantum mechanical property that can be either "up" or "down." In a ferromagnetic metal the electron spins tend to spontaneously align in the same direction. Ferromagnetism accounts for refrigerator magnets and most other magnetic behavior encountered in daily life.
</p>
<p>
  In antiferromagnetism, the spins align in a regular pattern with neighboring spins pointing in opposite directions, or antiparallel. For electrons living on a triangular lattice, however, this configuration is frustrated, because two of the three electrons in each triangle must have the same spin.
</p>
<p>
  "In physics, frustration is a good thing because it results in interesting properties. There are many kinds of frustrated systems in nature," Shastry said.
</p>
<p>
  The kinetic antiferromagnetism in a triangular lattice described by Haerter and Shastry results from the movement of electrons when there is a single "electron hole," or unoccupied site for an electron, in the lattice. They used a theoretical model that enabled them to study the spin configuration around the electron hole, and found that the hole is surrounded by an unfrustrated hexagon in which the electron spins alternate in an antiferromagnetic pattern.
</p>
<p>
  "The hole can be seen as a moving impurity around which spins tend to line up antiferromagnetically," the authors wrote in the paper.
</p>
<p>
  Physicists use the concept of a moving electron hole to simplify the analysis of the motions of large numbers of electrons. The Nagaoka-Thouless theorem shows how the motion of a single hole on an unfrustrated lattice leads to ferromagnetism. Haerter and Shastry showed that the motion of a single hole on a frustrated lattice results in weak antiferromagnetism.
</p>
<p>
  "It is surprising because the kinetic motion of electrons usually leads to ferromagnetism," Shastry said.
</p>
<p>
  Sodium cobalt oxide is one of the first known metallic compounds with a triangular lattice structure. The density of electron holes in the lattice varies depending on the sodium content, and this has dramatic effects on the material's magnetic behavior. Haerter and Shastry's theory provides new insights into the physics of this unusual system.

        <title>Summer bridge program prepares incoming engineering students</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 05 Sep 2005 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  The Baskin School of Engineering hosted 35 incoming engineering students last month for a week-long program of activities designed to give them a head start in their first quarter at UCSC. All incoming transfer students, female students, and underrepresented minority students received invitations to participate in the Engineering Summer Bridge Program.
</p>
<p>
  "It gives them a chance to meet other students and get to know the faculty before classes start," said Peggy Church, a counselor in the program and manager of the engineering school's undergraduate advising unit.
</p>
<p>
  The content-rich program, with a daily schedule from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m., resembles a mini-introduction to the quarter system, said program director Virginia Carrillo.
</p>
<p>
  The summer bridge program included assessments of students' strengths in math and other areas, workshops, advice from students and faculty, and team projects. The team projects involved developing a concept for a product using flashing LED lights, designing a circuit, and building a simple prototype. Concepts ranged from an emergency lighting system to a frisbee with flashing lights for nighttime games.
</p>
<p>
  Because the first year of engineering programs focuses so heavily on fundamental areas of math and science, some students may get discouraged and lose interest, Church said.
</p>
<p>
  "There is a retention problem in engineering between the freshman and sophomore years," she said. "We hope the summer bridge program will encourage students to stick with the math and science so that they can get to the more creative classes and lab opportunities in the upper level of the engineering curriculum."
</p>
<p>
  Participants got practical advice on how to succeed academically and an introduction to the various resources available to support them. When the going gets tough, the students will know where to turn for help, Church said.
</p>
<p>
  "We're the only UC campus to offer a program like this, but it's worth the effort if we can encourage more students to stay in engineering," she said.
</p>
<p>
  The Engineering Summer Bridge Program is supported by the California Alliance for Minority Participation (CAMP) and Developing Effective Engineering Pathways (DEEP) programs, both funded by the National Science Foundation.

        <title>Theodore R. Sarbin</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_7342" align="alignright" width="170"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/09/sarbin_theodore.05-09-05.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7342" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/09/sarbin_theodore.05-09-05.jpg" alt="Theodore Sarbin" width="170" height="213" /></a>Theodore Sarbin[/caption]
<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  <i>The following obituary was submitted to</i> Currents <i>on behalf of the family of Theodore R. Sarbin.</i>
</p>
<p>
  Theodore R. Sarbin, professor emeritus of psychology and criminology at the University of California, Santa Cruz, died at his home in Carmel on August 31 after a brief illness.
</p>
<p>
  As recently as August 18-21, Sarbin participated in the annual convention of the American Psychological Association (APA). At the convention, he was honored by a new award in his name that will be presented annually by the Society for Theoretical and Philosophical Psychology to a psychologist whose contributions reflect the themes and spirit of Sarbin's life work. At a celebratory dinner in his honor, Sarbin personally presented the first award to Jefferson Singer, professor of psychology at Connecticut College.
</p>
<p>
  Sarbin was born on May 8, 1911, in Cleveland, Ohio. He attended Ohio State University as an undergraduate and later obtained a master's degree from Case Western Reserve University. He received a Ph.D. in psychology from Ohio State University in 1941. His dissertation research, using data gathered at the University of Minnesota, examined the relative accuracy of statistical vs. clinical prediction for the academic achievement of undergraduates. Earlier, he had collaborated on research on the measurement of hypnotic depth. In both of these areas of research, he was a pioneer--setting in place questions for research that have been the object of inquiry for hundreds of subsequent studies by psychologists.
</p>
<p>
  Sarbin began his career as a research-oriented clinical psychologist, practicing first in Illinois and later in Los Angeles. His academic career was established at the University of California, Berkeley, where he served on the faculty from 1949 to 1969. During his time at Berkeley, he supervised more doctoral students than anyone else in his department, even while he continued to develop his own lines of research on problems in social psychology, with special application to problems in the domain of psychopathology. Because of his publications in the area, he came to be known as "Mr. Role Theory," defending the unorthodox position that problems conventionally thought of as "mental illness" could better be construed as moral judgments rendered by those in a position of social power about individuals whose conduct is unwanted or perceived as dangerous.
</p>
<p>
  While gentle and controlled in manner, Sarbin continued to challenge orthodox views in psychology throughout his professional life. He offered interpretations of hypnosis that avoided the necessity of positing a special mental state, viewing hypnotic behavior in terms of a person's ability to take the role of the hypnotic subject. Likewise, such concepts as hallucinations, anxiety, and schizophrenia were subject to Sarbin's relentless efforts to "demythologize" psychology.
</p>
<p>
  Sarbin left Berkeley in 1969 to join the UCSC faculty, where he remained until his retirement in 1976. As an emeritus professor, he continued to present courses at Santa Cruz for many years, and for a year was faculty assistant to the academic vice chancellor. In addition, he served for varying periods on the faculty at the Naval Postgraduate School in Monterey. In 1987, he became a research psychologist for the Defense Personnel Security Research and Education Center (PERSEREC), a program of the U.S. Navy. He continued to work at PERSEREC until two months ago.
</p>
<p>
  In the course of his academic career, Sarbin received scores of honors, including both Fulbright and Guggenheim fellowships. He was a research scholar at Nuffield College of Oxford University in 1963. He was a fellow at the Center for Advanced Study at Wesleyan University in 1968-69 and returned there for another period in 1975. He received the Morton Prince Award from the Society for Clinical and Experimental Hypnosis and the Henry Murray Award from the American Psychological Association. He was recognized with a lifetime achievement award from the Western Psychological Association in 2001.
</p>
<p>
  Included among his more than 250 professional publications are six books and another six edited volumes. Over the past 20 years, Sarbin concentrated on developing and promoting the practice of narrative psychology, departing from the narrow research methodologies of traditional psychology in favor of a method based on the primacy of story and dramatic unfolding as a way of understanding human experience. Here again, Sarbin was recognized as a pioneer in psychology, much as he was for his dissertation research done more than 65 years ago.
</p>
<p>
  Sarbin has a devoted following of former students and colleagues. He established the custom 40 years ago of hosting a dinner where he would present an award, "The Role Theorist of the Year," to a former student or colleague whom he deemed worthy of the honor. He presided over these occasions with grace and considerable wit. His memory was prodigious. He had the custom, exercised again with the 62 guests at his final banquet on August 19, to go around the room and say something about each of those present. He was much admired as a scholar of rare intellect. But he was also loved as a person of wisdom, compassion, warm gentility, and disarming humor.
</p>
<p>
  Sarbin was legendary for his dedication to his many former graduate students and colleagues with whom he continued to write and carry out research and other projects at a steady pace until his death. One of his original theoretical papers was accepted for publication in <i>Theory and Psychology</i>, a highly respected journal, one day prior to his death. When notified of the paper's acceptance, he said, "That's nice. More to come." Although he was suffering from cancer, he continued to work on his final book the day before he died. Few scholars--psychologists or otherwise--have been publishing continuously to such acclaim across seven decades.
</p>
<p>
  Despite his prolific academic accomplishments, Sarbin received wider attention for a 1988 report that challenged U.S. military policies about homosexuals. The study, "Gays in Uniform," demonstrated that there was no proof that homosexuals posed greater security risks than heterosexuals and no scientific evidence that homosexual soldiers would disrupt military life.
</p>
<p>
  This summer, Sarbin was diagnosed with advanced pancreatic cancer. The son of Samuel and Anna Sarbin, Sarbin is survived by his sister, Ruth Landy, of Beachwood, Ohio. His wife, Genevieve Sarbin, died in 1998. They married in 1948 in Los Angeles. Four siblings predeceased him: Mollie Gerring, Jacob Sarbin, Eugene Sarbin, and Miriam Baum. He is also survived by his partner Karin Sobeck; three sons: James Allen, Ronald Allen, and Theodore Sarbin Jr.; four grandchildren: Matthew Allen, Chelsea Allen, Park Allen, and Link Allen; two great-grandchildren: MacKenzie Allen and Delaney Allen; and numerous people who loved him dearly for his professional contributions, utter decency, kind care, and warm friendship.
</p>
<p>
  A memorial service will be held Saturday, October 1, from 1 to 5 p.m. at Monterey Peninsula College Library. Memorial donations can be made to the Ted Sarbin Research and Scholarship Fund to support ongoing research in social psychology at P.O. Box 222524, Carmel, CA 93922.

<p>
  Brian Malo, a reprographic technician at XpressIt! - Digital Copy Services died July 31 at his home in Capitola after fighting cancer for more than two years. He was 53 years old.
</p>
<p>
  "Brian worked with us since 2002; he was a wonderful employee and a great friend," said Geene Harbison, his supervisor. "He was a kind and gentle man that would do anything he could for you if and when you needed help."
</p>
<p>
  A great storyteller, Malo loved to joke around, and had a gift for drawing cartoon characters that made everybody's day. He loved being outdoors, either river rafting or hiking, and he especially loved being on the beach making his famous sand castles. He played the guitar and the piano, and enjoyed the blues.
</p>
<p>
  "Everyone he touched with his kind and warm heart and his gentle, loving, and nurturing soul, loved him," Harbison said.
</p>
<p>
  Contributions for a memorial bench in Brian's honor may be made to Dennis Malo, P.O.Box 7574, Santa Cruz, CA 95061.

<p>
  September 5 , 2005
</p>
<p>
  More than 3,000 sixth and seventh graders will see the path to college more clearly thanks to $16.3 million in federal funds that the UCSC Educational Partnership Center and three local school districts will administer.
</p>
<p>
  The federal grants, provided over the next six years by the U.S. Department of Education's <a href="http://www.ed.gov/programs/gearup/index.html">Gaining Early Awareness & Readiness for Undergraduate Programs</a> (GEAR-UP) initiative, will provide academic preparation and support for students in the Monterey Peninsula Unified School District (MPUSD), North Monterey County Unified School District (NMCUSD), and Pajaro Valley Unified School District (PVUSD).
</p>
<p>
  "Beginning in sixth grade, we introduce students to college and focus on improving their math and language arts skills," said Carrol Moran, executive director of the Educational Partnership Center (EPC) at UCSC. "We help students aspire to college and ensure that they have the academic preparation that allows them to live their dream. GEAR-UP helps us support these students from sixth grade through high school."
</p>
<p>
  Established in 1998, the EPC has more than doubled college-going rates among its partner schools in Monterey, San Benito, San Mateo, Santa Clara, and Santa Cruz Counties.
</p>
<p>
  With the infusion of new funds, students in the high school graduating classes of 2011 and 2012 at participating schools will benefit from augmented services beginning this fall, including:
</p>
<p>
  * academic counseling from middle school through high school;
</p>
<p>
  * a family involvement coordinator who will provide parent education and information about college and financial aid;
</p>
<p>
  * a college-awareness curriculum for middle school teachers, who will also receive additional training in mathematics and language arts instruction;
</p>
<p>
  * undergraduate academic interns who will serve as tutors and mentors for students throughout middle and high school;
</p>
<p>
  * opportunities for students and families to tour college campuses and attend programs that build their knowledge about college.
</p>
<p>
  "Our school board and professional staff are thrilled to be able to team up with UCSC and provide this support to our students and their families," said Keith Parkhurst, superintendent of NMCUSD, which is sharing a $9.8 million grant with MPUSD to reach nearly 2,000 students.
</p>
<p>
  Another 1,400 students in the PVUSD and at Alianza Charter School will benefit from a $6.5 million award that will build on the success of a previous GEAR-UP grant--now in its sixth and final year--administered by the EPC in Pajaro Valley.
</p>
<p>
  "These grants represent an important endorsement of the EPC's work," said Francisco Hernandez, vice chancellor of student affairs at UCSC. "The Educational Partnership Center has led the UC system in teaming up with K-12 schools to open the doors to college for the next generation."
</p>
<p>
  In addition to the three school districts, the following organizations have contributed to the GEAR-UP initiative: Thomson Peterson's; Imagine College; CTB McGraw-Hill; the Monterey and Santa Cruz County Offices of Education; the UCSC Mathematics, Science, and Engineering Achievement Program; Cabrillo College Advancement Program; the Santa Cruz Community Credit Union; the UC College Prep Initiative; the Pajaro Valley Latino Business Association; Migration and Immigration in the Americas Foundation; Bridging Multiple Worlds; and the UCSC Early Academic Outreach Program.

<p>
  The Baskin School of Engineering hosted 35 incoming engineering students last month for a week-long program of activities designed to give them a head start in their first quarter at UCSC. All incoming transfer students, female students, and underrepresented minority students received invitations to participate in the Engineering Summer Bridge Program.
</p>
<p>
  "It gives them a chance to meet other students and get to know the faculty before classes start," said Peggy Church, a counselor in the program and manager of the engineering school's undergraduate advising unit.
</p>
<p>
  The content-rich program, with a daily schedule from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m., resembles a mini-introduction to the quarter system, said program director Virginia Carrillo.
</p>
<p>
  The summer bridge program included assessments of students' strengths in math and other areas, workshops, advice from students and faculty, and team projects. The team projects involved developing a concept for a product using flashing LED lights, designing a circuit, and building a simple prototype. Concepts ranged from an emergency lighting system to a frisbee with flashing lights for nighttime games.
</p>
<p>
  Because the first year of engineering programs focuses so heavily on fundamental areas of math and science, some students may get discouraged and lose interest, Church said.
</p>
<p>
  "There is a retention problem in engineering between the freshman and sophomore years," she said. "We hope the summer bridge program will encourage students to stick with the math and science so that they can get to the more creative classes and lab opportunities in the upper level of the engineering curriculum."
</p>
<p>
  Participants got practical advice on how to succeed academically and an introduction to the various resources available to support them. When the going gets tough, the students will know where to turn for help, Church said.
</p>
<p>
  "We're the only UC campus to offer a program like this, but it's worth the effort if we can encourage more students to stay in engineering," she said.
</p>
<p>
  The Engineering Summer Bridge Program is supported by the California Alliance for Minority Participation (CAMP) and Developing Effective Engineering Pathways (DEEP) programs, both funded by the National Science Foundation.

  The Baskin School of Engineering hosted 35 incoming engineering students last month for a week-long program of activities designed to give them a head start in their first quarter at UCSC. All incoming transfer students, female students, and underrepresented minority students received invitations to participate in the Engineering Summer Bridge Program.
</p>
<p>
  "It gives them a chance to meet other students and get to know the faculty before classes start," said Peggy Church, a counselor in the program and manager of the engineering school's undergraduate advising unit.
</p>
<p>
  The content-rich program, with a daily schedule from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m., resembles a mini-introduction to the quarter system, said program director Virginia Carrillo.
</p>
<p>
  The summer bridge program included assessments of students' strengths in math and other areas, workshops, advice from students and faculty, and team projects. The team projects involved developing a concept for a product using flashing LED lights, designing a circuit, and building a simple prototype. Concepts ranged from an emergency lighting system to a frisbee with flashing lights for nighttime games.
</p>
<p>
  Because the first year of engineering programs focuses so heavily on fundamental areas of math and science, some students may get discouraged and lose interest, Church said.
</p>
<p>
  "There is a retention problem in engineering between the freshman and sophomore years," she said. "We hope the summer bridge program will encourage students to stick with the math and science so that they can get to the more creative classes and lab opportunities in the upper level of the engineering curriculum."
</p>
<p>
  Participants got practical advice on how to succeed academically and an introduction to the various resources available to support them. When the going gets tough, the students will know where to turn for help, Church said.
</p>
<p>
  "We're the only UC campus to offer a program like this, but it's worth the effort if we can encourage more students to stay in engineering," she said.
</p>
<p>
  The Engineering Summer Bridge Program is supported by the California Alliance for Minority Participation (CAMP) and Developing Effective Engineering Pathways (DEEP) programs, both funded by the National Science Foundation.

<p>
  New insights into the genetic differences between humans and chimpanzees, our closest relatives on the tree of life, are emerging from a comparative analysis of the genomes of the two species.
</p>
<p>
  UCSC researchers are part of an international team of scientists that has just published the first results from this analysis in the September 1 issue of the journal <i>Nature.</i>
</p>
<p>
  "The chimp genome sequence offers an unprecedented opportunity to understand primate evolution and to identify the genetic changes that gave rise to the modern human species. It's our first chance to see which parts of our genome are distinctly human," said Katherine Pollard, a postdoctoral researcher in UCSC's Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering (CBSE) and a coauthor of one of four papers on the chimpanzee genome published in this issue of <i>Nature</i>.
</p>
<p>
  The paper presents a catalog of the genetic differences that have accumulated since the lineages that led to modern humans and chimpanzees diverged from a common ancester about 6 million years ago. The researchers have identified several regions of the human genome that bear the hallmarks of strong natural selection, whereas the corresponding chimpanzee sequences do not. These sequences may hold the most promise for determining human-specific traits such as language.
</p>
<p>
  The analysis was carried out by the Chimpanzee Sequencing and Analysis Consortium, led by Robert Waterston of the University of Washington School of Medicine and Eric Lander of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. As with other major genome sequencing and analysis efforts, UCSC researchers provided bioinformatics expertise and developed a web-based browser and other valuable tools used to analyze the data. The <a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu">UCSC Genome Browser</a> is a highly popular web-based portal for the scientific exploration of genome sequences and related data.
</p>
<p>
  Pollard, who works with CBSE director David Haussler, has been involved in the chimp project since November 2003, when she began taking part in weekly conference calls with other members of the consortium. CBSE research scientist James Kent and software developer Kate Rosenbloom also contributed to the project and are coauthors on the paper.
</p>
<p>
  "We built a browser for the chimp genome and also added a couple of chimp tracks to the human genome browser to help with the comparative analysis," Kent said.
</p>
<p>
  Pollard said the <i>Nature</i> paper provides an overview of the consortium's initial findings and will be followed by additional papers focusing on specific questions. Pollard, for example, has been working to identify the regions of the human genome that have been evolving most rapidly.
</p>
<p>
  "That is the kind of question that could not be answered without looking at the genome of our closest relative," she said.

</p>
<p>
  Slawek Tulaczyk, associate professor of Earth sciences, will take part in "Science on Stage," an unusual theater production at the Exploratorium in San Francisco on Wednesday, September 14.
</p>
<p>
  Science on Stage 2005, presented by the Magic Theater in partnership with the Exploratorium, is the fifth annual series of script-in-hand performances of new plays about science and technology. In three dramatic readings, followed by discussions with the playwright and a scientist, the series explores topics ranging from autism to global warming and offers a glimpse of plays in the making.
</p>
<p>
  This year's series begins with <i>The Ice Breaker</i> by David Rambo. Tulaczyk, an expert on glaciers and global warming, will take the stage to answer questions from the audience after the play is over. The presentation begins at 7 p.m. in the McBean Theater at the Exploratorium.
</p>
<p>
  In <i>The Ice Breaker,</i> a young Ph.D. student on the verge of a momentous discovery seeks an ally in a disgraced genius. Cold science gives way to warm emotion, leading them to reveal the passions and demons that drive their quests.
</p>
<p>
  <i>The Ice-Breaker,</i> directed by Art Manke, will receive a full production in February 2006 as part of Magic's 2005-06 season, presented by the Magic Theatre, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Science & Technology Initiative, and the Martha Heasley Cox Raw Play Series.
</p>
<p>
  For advance tickets, please call the Magic Theatre's Box Office at (415) 441-8822. Admission is free for Magic subscribers, Exploratorium members, or with same-day museum admission.<br>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_7326" align="alignright" width="180"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/09/garden.180.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7326" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/09/garden.180.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="135" /></a>[/caption]

<p>
  With the warmest weather of the year now arriving, this is the perfect time to start thinking about how to extend your vegetable garden into the fall and winter and get landscape plants established for next spring's blossoms.
</p>
<p>
  A great first step is to visit the UCSC Farm & Garden's Fall Plant Sale, offering gardeners a rich and timely selection of organically raised vegetable seedlings, perennials, and California natives. Sponsored by the Center for Agroecology & Sustainable Food Systems, the sale takes place on Friday and Saturday, September 9 and 10, from noon to 6 p.m. on Friday and 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Saturday, in the Barn Theater parking lot at the intersection of Bay and High Streets.
</p>
<p>
  Lettuce, salad mix, Swiss chard, Asian greens, scallions, leeks, and brassicas like broccoli, cabbage, and kale are just a few of the vegetables that can be planted this fall for winter harvest. Flowers like bachelor buttons, calendula, bells of Ireland, and stock can also be planted in the fall for late winter and spring blooms.
</p>
<p>
  In addition to winter vegetables and culinary herbs, the sale will feature perennial flowers and shrubs. Some standouts of the perennial collection this fall include <i>Angelica stricta</i> 'Purpurea', a striking purple-leaved plant much loved by butterflies; <i>Verbascum</i> 'Arctic Summer', a drought-tolerant native of Greece, with tall, white fleecy stems bearing bright yellow flowers; <i>Correa</i> 'Carmine Bells', an Australian perennial with dusky rose tubular flowers that bloom November to April; and a California native flowering currant, <i>Ribes sanguineum glutinosum</i>, which bears long, showy clusters of pink flowers from winter into spring.
</p>
<p>
  Autumn is also the best time to plant perennial shrubs, including California natives, according to Christof Bernau, garden manager. "Because the soil is still warm, transplants quickly establish strong roots that ensure their survival during the winter," said Bernau. Fall plantings will be much larger and have more bloom than those planted in spring, he added.
</p>
<p>
  The sale will benefit the UCSC Farm & Garden Apprenticeship Program, a six-month training course in organic farming and gardening. Members of the Friends of the UCSC Farm & Garden receive a 10 percent discount on purchases; memberships will be available at the sale. For more information about the Fall Plant Sale or the Friends of the Farm & Garden, call (831) 459-3240 or send e-mail to <a href="mailto:jonitann@ucsc.edu">jonitann@ucsc.edu</a>.

<p>
  The Cultural Council of Santa Cruz County has received a $14,000 grant from the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) for a collaborative project with UCSC's Arts & Lectures program.
</p>
<p>
  Titled "Connecting Arts and Community<em>,"</em> the project will bring high-quality dance experiences to Santa Cruz County youth, their families, and other community members through performances and demonstrations by the internationally renowned David Dorfman Dance company.
</p>
<p>
  Activities will take place at county high schools and community youth organization sites.
</p>
<p>
  "This grant is a tremendous opportunity for the Cultural Council of Santa Cruz County and UCSC's Arts & Lectures to inspire local children by bringing world-class performances to high schools and community centers," noted Alberto Rafols, executive director of the Cultural Council. "It strengthens arts education in a time of dwindling school funding and presents a world of possibilities to the next generation of artists and audiences."
</p>
<p>
  "It's an ideal partnership," added Michelle Witt, director of UCSC's Arts & Lectures program. "Arts & Lectures has unique connections with artists, and the Cultural Council--through its SPECTRA Excellence in Arts Education program--has special knowledge of the schools and community."
</p>
<p>
  The David Dorfman Dance company has performed extensively in New York City, and throughout North and South America, Great Britain, and Europe. David Dorfman and the company's dancers and artistic collaborators have been honored with seven New York Dance and Performance ("Bessie") Awards, including one for Dorfman's community-based project, Familiar Movements (The Family Project). Dorfman's community projects are designed specifically to connect non-dancers with professionals, and to include such diverse groups as at-risk teens, schoolchildren, senior citizens, and people with disabilities.
</p>
<p>
  At the conclusion of its two-week residency in Santa Cruz, David Dorfman Dance will perform on March 10 and 11 at the UCSC Mainstage Theater as part of the Arts & Lectures 2005-06 performing arts season.
</p>
<p>
  The Cultural Council of Santa Cruz County is a private, nonprofit organization dedicated to advancing the arts in Santa Cruz County. For the past 26 years, the Cultural Council has provided arts education in local schools, encouraged cultural endeavors through grants to community arts organizations, assisted thousands of artists to market their work, developed facilities assistance for the arts, and educated the public about the importance of art and artistic diversity.
</p>
<p>
  Representatives from the Cultural Council and UCSC's Arts & Lectures have been meeting to plan the project since May of 2004. The site list for residency activities at this date includes: Watsonville High School, Harbor High School, Scotts Valley High School, Pajaro Valley High School, the Boys & Girls Club of Santa Cruz and Shoreline Middle School, and the Watsonville Charter School of the Arts.

  Christina Ravelo, professor of ocean sciences, has been named director of the Santa Cruz branch of the Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics (IGPP). Ravelo's five-year appointment begins September 1, 2005.<br>
</p>
<p align="left">
  "Professor Ravelo's extensive experience in promoting interdisciplinary research and education across the array of fields served by IGPP, along with her broad knowledge of how the campus and UC system function, make her the ideal person to serve as leader and advocate for IGPP in the coming years," said Stephen Thorsett, interim dean of the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences, in announcing the appointment.<br>
</p>
<p align="left">
  The IGPP, a multicampus research unit, established a Santa Cruz branch in 2000 led by founding director Thorne Lay, professor of Earth sciences. The institute supports a wide range of basic research on the origin, structure, and evolution of the Earth, the solar system, and the universe. It includes four interdisciplinary research centers at UCSC: the Center for the Origin, Dynamics, and Evolution of Planets (CODEP), the Center for the Dynamics and Evolution of the Land-Sea Interface (CDELSI), the Center for the Study of Imaging and Dynamics of the Earth (CSIDE), and the Center for Remote Sensing (CRS).<br>
</p>
<p align="left">
  As director of CDELSI for the past two years, Ravelo successfully spearheaded a National Science Foundation "Major Research Instrumentation" proposal to build a new common-access facility for isotope analysis. She also played a leading role in designing a new interdisciplinary graduate research and training program in coastal environmental change and ocean health.<br>

        <title>UCSC instructor links writing to democracy in Higher Education Exchange interview</title>

<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  Don Rothman views the writing classroom as a laboratory for democracy.
</p>
<p>
  After 27 years of guiding teachers and 32 years of teaching college students, he is convinced that writing classes are temporary communities in which students can develop critical thinking skills and lifelong habits that can contribute to democracy.<br>
</p>
<p>
  A senior writing lecturer and founding director of UCSC's Central California Writing Project, Rothman was recently sought out by the editor of <i>Higher Education Exchange,</i> a journal of the nonprofit Kettering Foundation. The result is a 12-page interview exploring Rothman's passion for connecting his work with undergraduates to civic engagement.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Rothman emphasized the importance of teaching students about the nature and role of persuasion in a democracy.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "One widespread belief regarding persuasion is that one should never weaken one's position by devoting much space to the other side," he noted. "I can't tell you how often my students register surprise when I suggest that compelling essays mostly focus on issues about which thoughtful people disagree, and that the substance of that disagreement should be evident in their essays."<br>
</p>
<p>
  "During class conversations, we often notice how our political leaders rarely express respect for others' views that have shaped their own," he added. "We have almost no public models revealing how persuasion based on logic and reason can be integral to elevating our collective intelligence about crucial issues....It seems to me that democracy requires a kind of patience to listen to what others have to say to work toward policies that are informed by diverse thinking. That means learning how to sustain other people's thinking and not just one's own. Writing can be really good for that."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Rothman, a recipient of the 2002 Distinguished Teaching Award from the UCSC Center for Teaching Excellence, believes that writing offers a nonviolent way to negotiate differences and persuade without coercion. He also questions why a country that prides itself on freedom of speech and freedom of the press educates so many people to be allergic to writing.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "We're getting the cream of the crop at the university, but many of these students hate writing and even choose their major to avoid having to do it," Rothman observed. "Unfortunately, writing is rarely taught in schools as a tool for nonviolent persuasion or as a multifaceted activity whose effectiveness often requires us to enhance our empathy. It is rarely taught as a tool for exploring ways to live together."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Rothman cofounded the Central California Writing Project in 1977. An outreach arm of the UCSC Writing Program, it is one of 185 national project sites dedicated to the support and professional development of all teachers of writing. He began teaching undergraduate writing classes in 1973, and also spent two years as provost of Oakes College in the early 1990s.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "UCSC's Writing Program has always embraced the teaching of writing as a way to nurture students' success in the university and their leadership in society," Rothman noted.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "For the most part when I meet these freshmen, they are quite limited in their awareness of public life beyond the importance of voting," he added.
</p>
<p>
  "I see them as beginners, not only as writers certainly, but as citizens. I would like the 10 weeks that they spend with me in a writing class to awaken their imaginations about who they are in the context of exploring who we are and can be collectively."

  Brian Malo, a reprographic technician at XpressIt! - Digital Copy Services died July 31 at his home in Capitola after fighting cancer for more than two years. He was 53 years old.
</p>
<p>
  "Brian worked with us since 2002; he was a wonderful employee and a great friend," said Geene Harbison, his supervisor. "He was a kind and gentle man that would do anything he could for you if and when you needed help."
</p>
<p>
  A great storyteller, Malo loved to joke around, and had a gift for drawing cartoon characters that made everybody's day. He loved being outdoors, either river rafting or hiking, and he especially loved being on the beach making his famous sand castles. He played the guitar and the piano, and enjoyed the blues.
</p>
<p>
  "Everyone he touched with his kind and warm heart and his gentle, loving, and nurturing soul, loved him," Harbison said.

        <title>UCSC researchers awarded grant to develop faster, cheaper DNA sequencing</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  A team including researchers at UCSC has received a major grant from the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) to develop new technology for genome sequencing.
</p>
<p>
  The grant is part of an NHGRI program to develop "revolutionary genome sequencing technologies" that will enable a human-sized genome to be sequenced for $1,000 or less.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The UCSC researchers are working with collaborators at other institutions to develop electronic sequencing in nanopores. David Deamer, research professor of chemistry and biochemistry and acting chair of biomolecular engineering, and Mark Akeson, associate adjunct professor of biomolecular engineering, are pioneers in the development of nanopore technology for DNA analysis.
</p>
<p>
  They will be working with Harvard University researchers Jene Golovchenko (principal investigator of the project) and Daniel Branton and University of New Orleans researcher Stephen Winters-Hilt, who earned his Ph.D. in bioinformatics at UCSC in 2003.
</p>
<p>
  The three-year, $5.2 million grant includes about $1.5 million for UCSC's part of the project. Deamer said about six researchers at UCSC will be involved in the effort. The objective of this project is to develop a general utility instrument to provide inexpensive sequencing that can also be used for projects to recognize genome variation. The group will design novel nanopores articulated with probes to sequentially, and directly, identify nucleotides in very long fragments of genomic DNA based on their unique electronic signals.
</p>
<p>
  NHGRI, part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), announced the grant August 8 as part of an expanded effort to advance the development of innovative sequencing technologies by awarding a dozen new grants totaling more than $32 million. The program is intended to reduce the cost of DNA sequencing and expand the use of genomics in biomedical research and health care.
</p>
<p>
  "The efforts are aimed at speeding the rate at which the next generation of sequencing technologies become available in the scientific lab and the medical clinic," said NHGRI director Francis Collins. "Not only will these technologies substantially reduce the cost of sequencing a genome, but they will provide a quantum leap in the scope and scale of research aimed at uncovering the genomic contributions to common diseases, such as cancer, heart disease, and diabetes."
</p>
<p>
  Over the past decade, DNA sequencing costs have fallen more than 50-fold, fueled in large part by tools, technologies, and process improvements developed as part of the successful effort to sequence the human genome. However, it still costs about $10 million to sequence 3 billion base pairs--the amount of DNA found in the genomes of humans and other mammals.<br>
</p>
<p>
  NHGRI's near-term goal is to lower the cost of sequencing a mammalian-sized genome to $100,000, which would enable researchers to sequence the genomes of hundreds or even thousands of people as part of studies to identify genes that contribute to common, complex diseases. Ultimately, NHGRI's vision is to cut the cost of whole-genome sequencing to $1,000 or less, which will enable the sequencing of individual genomes as part of routine medical care. The ability to sequence an individual genome cost-effectively could enable health care professionals to tailor diagnosis, treatment, and prevention to each person's unique genetic profile.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The new grants balance NHGRI's sequencing research portfolio by supporting more investigators working on technologies that would make it feasible to sequence a genome for $1,000. The majority of researchers who received NHGRI's initial sequencing technology grants, issued in October 2004, are working on technologies to sequence a genome for $100,000. Both approaches have many complementary elements that integrate biochemistry, chemistry, and physics with engineering to enhance the whole effort to develop the next generation of DNA sequencing and analysis technologies.
</p>
<p>
  "It is very important that we encourage and support the variety of sequencing technology projects that hold the most promise for revolutionizing genome sequencing. Each research team brings a unique set of skills and expertise to solving difficult scientific and engineering problems," said Jeffery Schloss, NHGRI's program director for technology development. "The different approaches will likely yield several successful and complementary technologies. It is going to be interesting to see how each technology progresses and which of them can ultimately be used by the average researcher or physician."

        <title>New research unveils complex mechanisms that control cell growth and division</title>

<p>
  Researchers studying the molecular mechanisms that control cell growth and division are piecing together a surprising and complicated regulatory system that offers promising targets for anticancer drugs.
</p>
<p>
  A new study led by UCSC researchers has revealed the interactions between key regulatory proteins that determine when cells initiate the process of cell division.
</p>
<p>
  The study, published August 11 in the journal <i>Cell</i>, represents an important step toward understanding the complex network of signals that controls the "cell cycle"--the orderly sequence of events that all cells pass through as they grow to a certain size, copy their chromosomes, and divide into two new cells.
</p>
<p>
  "This discovery solves an important piece of the puzzle for understanding how cell division is initiated when cells reach a certain size," said Douglas Kellogg, professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology and coauthor of the paper.
</p>
<p>
  Cell cycle control is one of the hottest areas of biomedical research, in part because of the potential applications in fighting cancer, which results from uncontrolled proliferation of cells in the body. Enzymes called cyclin-dependent kinases are the basic regulators of the cell cycle, and they in turn are regulated by other proteins that inhibit or activate them.
</p>
<p>
  The <i>Cell</i> paper describes the interactions of two proteins known as the Wee1 kinase and cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1). Stacy Harvey, a graduate student in Kellogg's lab, is first author of the paper and carried out most of the experiments. The other coauthors are UCSC graduate student Alyson Charlet and Harvard Medical School researchers Wilhelm Haas and Steven Gygi.
</p>
<p>
  Wee1 was already known to regulate Cdk1, inhibiting its activity and delaying the start of cell division until conditions are right. Harvey found that Cdk1 itself actually regulates Wee1, an unusual case of two proteins controlling each other's activity.
</p>
<p>
  "This kind of reciprocal regulation is really surprising. It suggests that these two proteins act together as a dynamic sensor to control the initiation of cell division," Kellogg said.
</p>
<p>
  Both proteins are kinases, a class of enzymes that "phosphorylate" or add phosphate groups to other proteins. Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation control the activity of many cellular enzymes. In this case, Cdk1 phosphorylates and activates Wee1, which then phosphorylates and inhibits Cdk1. If another enzyme dephosphorylates Cdk1, it becomes active and adds more phosphate groups to Wee1. This "hyperphosphorylation" of Wee1 inactivates it, and Cdk1 is then released from the inhibitory effect of Wee1 and can trigger cell division.
</p>
<p>
  According to Kellogg, the phosphorylation of Wee1 by Cdk1 is counteracted by another enzyme that rapidly removes phosphate groups, so that Wee1 undergoes continuous rounds of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation. The balance between these processes then determines whether Wee1 is active or inactive.
</p>
<p>
  "It's like an engine that is constantly running, so it's highly responsive to any change in the balance," Kellogg said.
</p>
<p>
  Aside from its implications for cancer research, this study offers new insights into the mechanisms behind the incredible diversity in the sizes and shapes of cells. That diversity is the result of variations in the molecular mechanisms that link cell growth and cell division. Each cell type seems to know when to stop growing and when to divide.
</p>
<p>
  "Understanding the mechanisms that determine cell size and shape is one of the long-term goals of this research. I think those mechanisms are going to be very complicated but also very beautiful," Kellogg said.

</p>
<p>
  <i><b>Rethinking Anti-Semitism: The Holocaust and the Contemporary World</b></i><b>.</b> The program features Peter Kenez, professor of history at UCSC who shares the Neufeld-Levin Chair in Holocaust Studies, and historian and Holocaust scholar Yehuda Bauer, professor of Holocaust studies at the Avraham Harman Institute of Contemporary Jewry at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

<p>
  <i><b>Autobiography and History: Peter Kenez.</b></i> UCSC history professor Peter Kenez discusses the extent to which our views can be derived from our life experiences and the extent to which we can be considered autonomous agents. In addition, he discussed the extent to which the work of a historian is influenced by having lived through the era about which he or she is writing.
</p>
<p>

  <a name="content" id="content"></a> BEGIN STORY
</p>
<p>
  UCSC's Interdisciplinary Sciences Building was the site of several coordinated training exercises by campus firefighters and the Santa Cruz Fire Department recently.
</p>
<p>
  The departments come to UCSC to work on rappelling and ladder truck training, said UCSC assistant fire chief Jeff Trapp.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "We get an opportunity to cross train with Santa Cruz firefighters and equipment," he said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  City firefighters brought their ladder engine--with a 104-foot ladder--to the August 5 training session.<br>
</p>
<p>
  UCSC firefighters Phil Kleinheinz and Todd Meyer were among several firefighters rappelling down the side of the Interdisciplinary Sciences Building.
</p>
<p>
  One declining to take part was veteran Paul Babb, who has been with UCSC for 30 years and is retiring this month. Babb just shook his head when asked if he wanted to try it "one last time."<br>

        <title>Free supercomputing time and resources available for UC researchers</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 22 Aug 2005 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  The San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) at UC San Diego offers access to a vast array of computational resources through the Academic Associates Program, which is available to all UC researchers with a need for massive computational power and large storage and archiving space.
</p>
<p>
  The Academic Associates Program (AAP), formerly known as the Block Grant Program, was started in 1995 to give UC researchers free access to large-scale computational and data management resources at the SDSC. Through startup accounts, AAP helps UC researchers learn how to use SDSC resources, paving the way for obtaining larger accounts through SDSC allocations. Any qualified UC researcher can request supercomputing time using the online application form <a href="http://www.sdsc.edu/user_services/aap/user/apply.html">http://www.sdsc.edu/user_services/aap/user/apply.html</a>.
</p>
<p>
  For more information, contact the campus AAP administrator, Don Korycansky, at (831) 459-5843 or <a href="mailto:kory@es.ucsc.edu">kory@es.ucsc.edu</a>.

<p>
  Campus email users receiving an unusual number of "bounceback" messages may be inadvertently using out-of-date addresses.
</p>
<p>
  Campus email addresses that include <i>ADM, zzyx,</i> and <i>natsci</i> have been phased out, and e-mail to those addresses no longer reach their intended recipients.
</p>
<p>
  While many users have simply dropped the extra letters from their email addresses, others have selected completely different e-mail addresses during the changeover (i.e., <i>user@zzyx.ucsc.edu</i> could have been changed to <i>samz@ucsc.edu</i>.
</p>
<p>
  Please check online by using the Faculty / Staff directory at <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/about/find_people.asp">http://www.ucsc.edu/about/find_people.asp</a> to find the most current campus e-mail addresses.

  <span class="storyhead">Professor Emeritus William Friedland honored for lifetime achievement</span>
</p>
<p>
  The first time William Friedland visited UC Santa Cruz in 1968, he didn't even stop the car to look around. The campus was too isolated, he thought.
</p>
<p>
  <img align="right" alt="Photo of William Friedland" height="233" src="http://www.ucsc.edu/currents/05-06/art/friedland_william.05-08-08.jpg" width="160">Lucky for Friedland, UCSC professors quickly set him straight about the opportunities available at the young campus, and he was recruited to join the faculty. Friedland went on to make his mark as founding chair of community studies and a scholar whose research revealed the "cozy" relationship between UC's agricultural researchers and the state's powerful farming interests.
</p>
<p>
  Now a professor emeritus and research professor of community studies and sociology, Friedland is being honored for his contributions during the Rural Sociological Society's annual meeting August 8-12 in Tampa, Florida. "In a tribal sense, Bill is one of the elders of the sociology of agriculture movement," said Doug Constance, an associate professor of sociology at Sam Houston State University, who is coordinating the tribute in Friedland's honor. "His contribution was to look at the people in agriculture--the farmers and the farmworkers--at a time when power was being concentrated in global agricultural corporations. Everyone accepted that bigger was better until Bill came along and asked, 'Better for whom?'"
</p>
<p>
  Friedland's numerous publications include <i>From Columbus to Conagra: The Globalization of Agriculture and Food</i>, <i>Manufacturing Green Gold: The Conditions and Social Consequences of Lettuce Harvest Mechanization</i>, and <i>Destalking the Wily Tomato: A Case Study in Social Consequences in California Agricultural Research</i>.
</p>
<p>
  "For me, the university has been a remarkable place--that's the only way to describe it," said Friedland. "Intellectually, I found a kind of freedom that proves that academic freedom is a serious thing."
</p>
<p>
  Friedland's wide-ranging interest in agriculture has focused on the social aspects of agriculture, including the impact of technology on labor. He is perhaps best known for his pathbreaking study of the consequences of the mechanization of tomato harvesting. Mechanization accelerated with the development at UC Davis of a machine harvester and a tomato that bears ripe fruit all at once rather than over time.
</p>
<p>
  Mechanization ushered in a new era of efficiency, but Friedland documented the downside: The workforce collapsed from 50,000 laborers to 18,000, and the number of growers shrank from 4,000 to 600, weeding out those who could not afford a $35,000 harvester. Total acreage doubled, and tomato growing moved from Stockton to the southern San Joaquin Valley, where typical operations sprawled to 75 acres.
</p>
<p>
  Davis researchers questioned the value of Friedland's after-the-fact analyses and challenged him to develop predictive models. Turning his attention to lettuce, Friedland identified the conditions that would precede mechanization and sought to anticipate its consequences. That study established Friedland as the leading researcher in the sociology of agriculture.
</p>
<p>
  Friedland's research has illuminated what he calls the "cozy relationship" between UC researchers and commodity advisory boards, which tax their members to generate the funds needed to engage university experts. The result, according to Friedland, is a narrow research agenda set by the agricultural industry but subsidized by taxpayers who contribute to the university's operating expenses.
</p>
<p>
  He urged his colleagues conducting agricultural research at UC Davis to expand their focus on labor beyond the needs of growers. "Agriculture depends on workers, and the university ought to develop a knowledge base that deals with workers and their welfare," said Friedland. "The University of California is one of the leading agencies in agricultural research in the world, and it needs to be responsive to social consequences and not just economic efficiency."
</p>
<p>
  Finding little traction for his approach at Davis or within UC's Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources (DANR), Friedland lobbied the state legislature to require the university to conduct studies that would anticipate the social consequences of agricultural research and to set social goals. He urged lawmakers to establish a research unit that could--without impeding innovation or academic freedom--conduct "projective analysis," and thereby anticipate impacts like widespread job loss.
</p>
<p>
  "That went over like a lead balloon," recalled Friedland.
</p>
<p>
  Friedland's disappointment has waned little over the years, in part because he feels the challenges have only increased as innovation has shifted from the introduction of machines to the insertion of genes. The genetic modification of crops, like the widespread use of synthetic chemical pesticides, has been facilitated by agricultural researchers at universities like UC, he noted.
</p>
<p>
  The university's service to agribusiness has come at the expense of consumers and workers, according to Friedland, who called on the university to respond to consumer demand for organic food by investing heavily in the development of organic farming methods.
</p>
<p>
  Reflecting on his professional accomplishments, Friedland says community studies and its integration of living and learning is his greatest source of satisfaction. "Everyone learns through life, but most people do it inefficiently. Community studies was a deliberate attempt by this campus to get students to utilize their living experience as a conscious learning process," said Friedland, who worked in the Detroit auto industry and in union organizing for 12 years before turning to academia.
</p>
<p>
  Friedland, who retired from teaching in 1991, is researching a book about wine and grapes.

<p>
  Local dream expert and UC Santa Cruz psychology instructor Veronica Tonay is featured in the upcoming new miniseries <i>Dream Decoders</i>, a show that helps participants and viewers understand the hidden meaning of their dreams.
</p>
<p>
  The series premieres on the <a href="http://www.discoveryhealth.com">Discovery Health Channel</a> on Wednesday, August 17, at 10 p.m. (E.T./P.T.) and will air in its entirety on Tuesdays at 8 p.m. (E.T./P.T.) beginning November 1.
</p>
<p>
  Tonay is a clinical psychologist and the author of <i>Every Dream Interpreted</i> and <i>The Creative Dreamer</i>. Understanding the meaning of dreams can contribute to greater emotional and psychological health, said Tonay. "Dreams are a portal to insights that can be very important in our lives," she said.
</p>
<p>
  Filmed before a live audience, the show features common and universal dreams, including elements such as being chased and falling. During each episode, the "decoders" evaluate the dreams of three or four people, who describe their dreams and nightmares verbally and through brief video re-creations. Tonay and the other experts interview the dreamers and analyze clues before offering their individual analysis to the participants, who in turn share their thoughts about the decoders' feedback. Each episode also features brief exchanges between the decoders and members of the studio audience.
</p>
<p>
  Joining Tonay on <i>Dream Decoders</i> are Alan Siegel, a psychotherapist and dream researcher; Marcia Emery, a psychologist and expert on intuition; and Edward Bynum, a clinical psychologist and director of the Behavioral Medicine and Biofeedback Clinic at University of Massachusetts Health Services.

<p>
  About 200 astronomers, including many of the world's leading astrophysicists and cosmologists, are meeting on campus this week for a weeklong conference to honor three UCSC professors--astronomers George Blumenthal and Sandra Faber and physicist Joel Primack.
</p>
<p>
  Blumenthal, Faber, and Primack have all made fundamental contributions to the scientific understanding of how galaxies formed and how the universe has evolved over time. The conference in their honor, organized to celebrate their 60th birthdays, will address the recent explosion of observational data in astronomy and explore its theoretical implications.
</p>
<p>
  As part of the conference, Primack, a professor of physics, and his wife, Nancy Abrams, will give a public talk entitled "The View from the Center of the Universe: Discovering Our Extraordinary Place in the Cosmos." The talk will be based on their new book by the same title, due to be published in the spring of 2006.
</p>
<p>
  Primack and Abrams, a writer and songwriter, have a special interest in the cultural implications of modern cosmology and have cotaught a course on cosmology and culture at UCSC since 1996. Their presentation will take place from 8 to 10 p.m. on Tuesday, August 9, in Classroom Unit 2 on the UCSC campus. The event is free and open to the public. For additional information about the public lecture, contact Nancy Moore at (831) 459-5092 or <a href="mailto:nmoore@ucsc.edu">nmoore@ucsc.edu</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The title of the conference, "Nearly Normal Galaxies in a Lambda CDM Universe," refers to the prevailing cold dark matter (CDM) theory of cosmology. Convincing evidence for dark matter, which cannot be seen but can be detected indirectly by observing its gravitational effects, was discovered by astronomers in the late 1970s. About 85 percent of all the matter in the universe is thought to be dark matter, while ordinary matter accounts for the remaining 15 percent. In the 1980s, Blumenthal, Faber, Primack, and others established the important role of slow-moving ("cold") dark matter in the formation, properties, and evolution of galaxies. Their ideas about CDM, though more than 20 years old, remain the dominant working paradigm for structure formation in the universe.
</p>
<p>
  The Greek letter lamda in the title refers to a repulsive force that Albert Einstein added to his 1916 theory of gravity to counteract the attractive force of gravity so as to preserve a static universe. Einstein called lambda his "biggest blunder" after the astronomer Edwin Hubble discovered in 1929 that the universe was not static but expanding. Recent observations, however, show that the expansion of the universe is not being slowed by gravity, as expected, but is actually speeding up. This surprising result suggests that Einstein's repulsive force, lambda--now called "dark energy"--may have been right after all.
</p>
<p>
  The conference title also refers back to a landmark conference held at UCSC in 1986 and documented in a book edited by Faber, <i>Nearly Normal Galaxies</i> (Springer-Verlag, New York, 1987). This year's conference is expected to be equally memorable as one of the major conferences of the decade on galaxy formation.
</p>
<p>
  "Progress in cosmology has been truly astronomical since the last conference 19 years ago," said David Koo, a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC who helped organize this year's conference.
</p>
<p>
  "Using the Hubble Space Telescope and Keck Telescopes finished in the mid-1990s, astronomers can now peer at 'nearly normal' galaxies 8 billion years further back in time than the 4 billion years possible in 1986, to near the beginning of our universe just after the Big Bang," Koo said.
</p>
<p>
  Blumenthal, a professor of astronomy and astrophysics, joined the UCSC faculty in 1972. He continues to investigate the origin of structure in the universe, such as galaxies and clusters of galaxies, and the role that dark matter plays in the formation and evolution of this structure. He also studies related cosmological issues, such as the generation of density fluctuations during an early inflationary phase of the universe. In addition to his work in cosmology, Blumenthal has studied gamma-ray bursts, accretion disks, and active galactic nuclei and maintains a strong interest in those areas. He served as chair of the UC Academic Senate for 2004-05.
</p>
<p>
  Faber, a University Professor of astronomy and astrophysics, also came to UCSC in 1972. She is a leading authority on telescopes and astronomical instrumentation, and is renowned for her work on the role of dark matter in the formation of structure in the universe. Faber and a group of colleagues were the first to detect high-speed flows of galaxies on cosmic scales. She is currently involved in several projects, including a major survey of distant galaxies (the DEEP Survey), studies of supermassive black holes in the centers of galaxies, and the development of adaptive optics systems to sharpen the images of ground-based telescopes. Her many awards and honors include the Bok Prize of Harvard University, the Dannie Heineman Prize for Astrophysics, and election to the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society.
</p>
<p>
  Primack has done pioneering research in particle physics and cosmology. His current research in cosmology involves the use of supercomputers to simulate and visualize the evolution of the universe and the formation of galaxies. These computer simulations enable him and his collaborators to compare the predictions of theories with the observational data. Primack is also active in addressing policy issues in science and technology, and he is currently chairman of the American Physical Society Forum on Physics and Society. His most recent policy work has been on efforts to protect the near-Earth space environment and on NASA funding for astrophysics. A fellow of the American Physical Society and the American Association for the Advancement of Science, Primack joined the UCSC faculty in 1973.
</p>
<p>
  The conference is sponsored by NASA, the National Science Foundation, and Orion Telescopes & Binoculars. Additional details about the conference are available online at <a href="http://astro.ucsc.edu/%7Enng/">astro.ucsc.edu/~nng/</a>.<br>

        <title>New Teacher Center brings in $1.7 million in new grants</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 08 Aug 2005 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>7255</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  The New Teacher Center is on a roll. With positive press and an influx of $1.695 million in new grants in recent weeks, the center is poised to expand its reach as a national leader in the field of teacher preparation.
</p>
<p>
  In a recent column, <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> editorial writer Louis Freedberg highlighted state programs designed to keep new teachers on the job and working as effectively as possible. The New Teacher Center (NTC) is "regarded as the best of its kind in the nation," wrote Freedberg.
</p>
<p>
  Established in 1998, the NTC has become a national resource for teacher training. The center focuses on improving student performance by increasing teacher retention and effectiveness.
</p>
<p>
  The NTC model of teacher support provides beginning teachers with two years of mentoring by veteran teachers who have been trained as "teachers of teachers." The infusion of support dramatically reduces new-teacher attrition. NTC collaborates with school districts in more than 30 states and has developed a support program for principals, as well.
</p>
<p>
  California is estimated to need 100,000 new teachers in the next decade to replace those who retire, and investing in the next generation is wise, says NTC director Ellen Moir.
</p>
<p>
  "Typically, nearly half of all new teachers leave the profession within five years, but we're able to retain almost 90 percent," said Moir. "If we can't keep teachers in the classroom, the profession becomes a revolving door, and students in our lowest-performing schools suffer most since new teachers so often teach in the most challenged schools."
</p>
<p>
  Foundations continue to endorse the center's approach, with nearly $1.7 million coming into NTC's coffers recently.
</p>
<p>
  Among the largest grants is a three-year $750,000 award from the Wachovia Foundation that will fund a mentoring program for new teachers in public schools in the District of Columbia. NTC staff will train mentor teachers, who will be recruited to work full-time with approximately 12 new teachers each.
</p>
<p>
  In addition, the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation has provided a $725,000 grant that will fund the center's work with three of East Palo Alto's lowest-performing elementary and middle schools.
</p>
<p>
  The NTC's training protocols will be further replicated with assistance from the W. Clement & Jessie V. Stone Foundation. A $55,000 grant from the foundation will support the "training of trainers" in New York City, where the NTC is training 350 mentors who are working with 6,000 new teachers.
</p>
<p>
  A $40,000 grant from Washington Mutual is supporting the NTC's mentor training programs in California and the center's annual national symposium on teacher induction, while $25,000 from the Carnegie Corporation of New York City is funding a planning grant to better align training in literacy instruction for high school teachers.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, the Rockefeller Foundation has provided $100,000 over two years to document the center's participation in New York City's $36 million initiative to revamp support for new teachers using the NTC mentoring model. The grant will fund the development of policy recommendations based on the lessons learned in New York and will pay for the distribution of those results to district leaders, policy makers, union leaders, university partners, and others.

<p>
  Fourteen visitors from South Korea, Japan, Nigeria, Italy, Mexico, Greece, and Nepal joined six UCSC students for a 10-day course on sustainable agriculture offered through UCSC's Program In Community and Agroecology (PICA).
</p>
<p>
  The course, which ran July 6-16, focused on current agroecology research that will be valuable to participants in field and academic settings in their home countries, said PICA director Karen Nordstrom. Participants attended numerous workshops, including sessions on organic olive production and cob construction, a building method that makes use of local resources, including earth, straw, rice stalks, and other materials that are often considered agricultural waste products. Participants built a cob oven to learn about the process. Cob structures are long-lasting and naturally insulated from extremes of heat and cold.

        <title>75 IT staff join new ITS organization</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 08 Aug 2005 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  On August 3, Larry Merkley, vice provost of information technology, officially welcomed 75 IT staff from around campus into the new ITS organization. IT staff were welcomed from the following divisions: Physical and Biological Sciences, Social Sciences, Humanities, Arts, Library, Student Affairs, University Relations, Business Administrative Services, and University Extension. The transition of IT staff from the School of Engineering will take place in the coming months.
</p>
<p>
  Two ITS All-Hands meetings to welcome new staff into the organization and to provide additional information about the transition are scheduled this month: on Wednesday, August 10, and on Wednesday, August 24. ITS staff should attend one or both of these sessions, which will give staff an opportunity to meet with ITS directors and other staff, and to ask specific questions about the transition. <a href="http://its.ucsc.edu/newsletter/full_story.php?id=218">[Full story, including Q&A]</a>

        <title>Free 'Tableau Vivant' performance at Lighthouse Point on August 21</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_7251" align="alignright" width="230"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/08/hark.08-08-05.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7251" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/08/hark.08-08-05.jpg" alt="" width="230" height="153" /></a>[/caption]
<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  The collaborative ensemble Cmd-Z--directed by UCSC associate professor of art E. G. Crichton and Santa Cruz performance artist Lauren Crux--will present a tableau vivant performance piece titled <i>Hark and Woe</i> on Sunday, August 21. The free event will take place at 5 p.m, on the lawn in front of the Surfing Museum on West Cliff Drive at Lighthouse Point in Santa Cruz.
</p>
<p>
  Historically, a "tableau vivant" is a scene presented by costumed actors who remain silent and motionless as if in a picture. It was a custom in Victorian England, for example, for upper-class parties to enact the scene of a particular Renaissance painting. In Latin America and southern Europe, tableaux vivants have also played a role in Catholic liturgical processions.
</p>
<p>
  "We want to adapt this form of performance to a site-specific contemporary visual work that will both entertain and raise questions," said Crichton. "This dynamic tableau vivant performance is inspired by the politics of hope and humor in times of high anxiety."
</p>
<p>
  Crichton added that the terms "Hark" and "Woe" are used to suggest two ends of the spectrum of human emotions, partially modeled after Victorian graveyard statues that portray female figures in postures of exaltation and grief.
</p>
<p>
  "The inspiration for our site is the surfer boy statue, a contemporary example of the heroic, idealized monument to fallen soldiers," said Crichton. "With grand gestures of exaltation and grief, <i>Hark and Woe</i> evokes failed heroes, unstable monuments, cranky mortals and other beings. Come lower your blood pressure and enjoy!"
</p>
<p>

        <title>Arts & Lectures announces new season of internationally acclaimed performers and speakers</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 08 Aug 2005 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>7249</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_7248" align="alignright" width="230"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/08/flamenca.08-08-05.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7248" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/08/flamenca.08-08-05.jpg" alt="Spain's traditional flamenco troupe Noche Flamenca will perform two shows." width="230" height="144" /></a>Spain's traditional flamenco troupe Noche Flamenca will perform two shows.[/caption]
<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  Environmental advocate Robert F. Kennedy Jr., superstar classical violinist Midori, Grammy-winning mandolinists Mike Marshall and Chris Thile, and Spain's powerful traditional flamenco troupe Noche Flamenca are just a few of the internationally acclaimed artists and speakers on the 2005-06 UCSC Arts & Lectures season.
</p>
<p>
  Kennedy will headline a new "Outspoken Speakers" series featuring lectures and discussions with renowned thinkers about issues relating to science, nature, and the environment. Harvard physics professor Lisa Randall--a brilliant communicator with infectious enthusiasm who has been described as one of "Einstein's intellectual heiresses" by MSNBC--and celebrated nature writer and environmental activist Terry Tempest Williams will round out the new series.
</p>
<p>
  Arts & Lectures' ambitious "Global Beat" series will feature Llan de Cubel, an award-winning, Celtic-influenced folk group from the north coast of Spain; the Pablo Ziegler Trio for Nuevo Tango--led by the Argentinean pianist who was a member of the legendary Astor Piazzolla's New Tango Quintet; Peru Negro, an Afro-Peruvian ensemble blending melodic guitar, passionate singing, sensual dancing, and colorful costumes in a carnival atmosphere; and Malian blues-rockers Tinariwen--a group of exiled nomads from the southern Sahara who mix traditional instruments with electric guitars and the sounds of Bob Marley and Jimi Hendrix.
</p>
<p>
  "We're bringing international, leading-edge work that, for the most part, you're not likely to see elsewhere," noted director of Arts & Lectures, Michelle Witt. "There are also more performances this year reflecting interdisciplinary collaborations and partnerships."
</p>
<p>
  Witt added that Arts & Lectures has also expanded its arts education program with the coming season. Last year, the program reached approximately 5,000 local students and adults.
</p>
<p>
  "This year we are doing more community-based projects such as a series of free talks at the Santa Cruz Museum of Art and History, and a performance series at the new Santa Cruz family shelter," Witt noted. "Seventy-five percent of the artists we bring this season will go into the community."
</p>
<p>
  "We will also begin a special pilot project with the Cultural Council of Santa Cruz County and the National Endowment for the Arts to create a two-week residency with the David Dorfman Dance Company," Witt added. "The company will be giving lecture/demonstrations at many local high schools, as well as a wide variety of community and campus organizations. Arts & Lectures and the Cultural Council will additionally collaborate to bring several 2005-06 series artists into community schools through the SPECTRA program.
</p>
<p>
  The new season will also include a staging of Amy Tan's <i>Immortal Heart</i> by the Word for Word theater company, pianist Christopher O'Riley in a program titled "Shostakovich Meets Radiohead"; the So Percussion ensemble, Fugate/Bahiri Ballet NY, Tandy Beal's holiday favorite <i>Mixed Nutz</i>!, and the Turtle Island String Quartet performing "A Love Supreme: The Music of John Coltrane."
</p>
<p>
  UCSC staff and faculty should be pleased to learn that they may now purchase tickets to the 2005-06 season at the student/senior rate.
</p>
<p>
  For a complete season lineup and ticket information, go to the new Arts & Lectures web site at: <a href="http://artslectures.ucsc.edu/">artslectures.ucsc.edu</a> or call the UCSC Ticket Office at (831) 459-2159.

        <title>UCCP collaboration with Mexico will provide online courses in Spanish</title>
        <pubDate>Wed, 27 Jul 2005 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>7224</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  The University of California's online education program took a leap forward with the recent announcement of a plan to translate its online math courses into Spanish.
</p>
<p>
  The university has agreed to share its online materials with Mexican educators, who will translate the courses and make the Spanish-language versions available to students in California.
</p>
<p>
  The Santa Cruz-based <a href="http://www.uccp.org">UC College Prep Initiative</a> (UCCP) has developed online high school and advanced placement courses that utilize streaming video and interactive simulations to help students succeed in subjects like algebra and calculus.
</p>
<p>
  "Many students in California are entering college without the basic skills they need to succeed in math and could benefit from such courses," said UCCP director Moises Torres. "This exchange provides California's native Spanish speakers with a powerful supplemental tool to support their success in math, as well as their progress in meeting California's rigorous academic standards."
</p>
<p>
  Spanish-language courses are also a key step in the development of a binational high school that would support the educational goals of students on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border, said Torres. Such collaboration would allow migrant students to finish their high school education online in Mexico or the U.S. and would enable students in Mexico to take high school courses that would help prepare them for admission to colleges and universities in the U.S., Mexico, and Europe, he said.
</p>
<p>
  The language initiative was announced at the third annual UCCP Online Teaching & Learning Institute, which was held at the University Inn in Santa Cruz July 20-22. Susan D. Patrick, director of the Office of Educational Technology of the U.S. Department of Education, delivered the keynote address during the institute, which was attended by about 170 educators. The proceedings were also made available online for those who could not attend in person.
</p>
<p>
  A delegation of education officials from Mexico attended the institute, including representatives of Colegio de Bachilleres in Mexico City, the Corporate University for Internet Development (CUDI), the National University of Mexico (UNAM), and the National Council of Science and Technology (CONACYT), Mexico's equivalent of the National Science Foundation. Like UCCP, these organizations have developed an array of online high school courses designed to help students complete accelerated and remedial work, and to fill in gaps in course offerings at some schools. The binational collaboration grew out of meetings held in Mexico City earlier this year.
</p>
<p>
  "Cooperation over the Internet opens a new era for us," said UCSC vice chancellor Francisco Hernandez, founder and executive director of UCCP Online.
</p>
<p>
  The distribution of UCCP's online courses outside California is overseen by Gary Lopez of the <a href="http://www.montereyinstitute.org">Monterey Institute for Technology and Education</a>. Lopez administers the National Respository of Online Courses (NROC), funded in part by the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation. He discussed technology and Mexico's counterpart to Internet2 with Mexican education officials.
</p>
<p>
  Institute participants also discussed plans for a recurring online learning conference in Mexico City that would complement the UCCP gathering.
</p>
<p>
  "We have problems in each of our countries and between our countries that can be addressed by both the online learning environment and by combining the languages and cultures of Mexico and the U.S.," said Torres.
</p>
<p>
  In other news from the institute, Julie Mendoza of UC's All Campus Consortium on Research for Diversity (ACCORD), based at UCLA, discussed her research on the high school dropout rate among Hispanic students in Los Angeles. Hispanic students have the highest dropout rate in the United States and in California, she said.

<p>
  Nighttime parking permits will be introduced September 1, one of several transportation changes starting off the 2005-06 academic year.
</p>
<p>
  Under the new system, weeknight parking permits will extend until 8:30 P.M. in most campus core parking lots.<br>
</p>
<p>
  While parking will remain free in a number of lots on the campus perimeter, night parking permits will cost $102 annually, $30 quarterly, or $2 daily.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Those who purchase A, B, or C parking permits will not need to purchase an additional permit to park during evening hours, however, and R permit holders will also have access to some close-in parking lots after 5 P.M. Full details of the night parking program are availabe on the TAPS web site: <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/taps">www2.ucsc.edu/taps.</a><br>
</p>
<p>
  "In implementing evening parking enforcement, the most important factor to us at TAPS, and to the various campus constituencies that provided valuable guidance and input on this policy, has been equity," said Wes Scott, Transportation and Parking Services director. "Equity means that all users of the system bear some of the cost, so that no group--in this case, daytime users--is unfairly overburdened."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Scott said TAPS will closely monitor the operation of the new policy, and fine-tune it if necessary.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Faculty and staff parking permits and transportation program materials for 2005-06, including Metro bus passes, Bike & Shower program enrollment and Emergency Ride Home program vouchers are available online at <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/taps">www2.ucsc.edu/taps.</a> Online applications for the purchase of annual nighttime parking permits will be available August 1, 2005.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Those seeking applications are being strongly encouraged to apply online rather than in person because of a shortage of parking spaces near the TAPS parking sales office. Construction of new facilities in the area has reduced customer parking to five spaces in the 10-minute parking zone next to Barn H. No overflow parking is available.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Other changes beginning in the fall include an end to free Metro bus passes for all faculty and staff, and increases in metered parking and some parking rates:<br>
</p>
<p>
  * <b>Metro passes.</b> Metro bus passes will remain free to those faculty and staff who do not purchase any type of parking permit. Those who wish to receive a bus pass in addition to their parking permit or scratch-off packet will need to pay an additional $24 for their annual bus pass, a payroll deduction of just $2 per month.<br>
</p>
<p>
  * <b>Metered parking.</b> Parking at meters will cost more in 2005-06. A quarter will buy 12 minutes of parking, with an hour of parking costing $1.25. More meters will be placed throughout campus parking lots, providing greater access for those who need to park for short periods of time.<br>
</p>
<p>
  <b>* Vanpool rates.</b> Vanpool program rates, while still highly subsidized by TAPS, will rise by $4 to $5.50 per month. Monthly vanpool fares will vary from $23.50 to $31 per month, based on the distance of the vanpool commute; last year's rates ranged between $19.50 and $25.50 per month.
</p>
<p>
  * <b>Parking permits.</b> Some, but not all, parking fees and program costs will remain at the 2004-05 rate. A, B, C and R (remote) permit rates will not increase when purchased on an annual or academic year basis. All quarterly permit prices will increase; those who purchase permits on a quarterly basis will pay $5 to $12 more per quarter, depending on the type of permit selected.<br>
</p>
<p>
  With the exception of half-packets and carpooler supplemental Daily A packet purchases, Daily A Packet (and Daily B Packet) rates will not increase; half packets will increase from $78.75 for a packet of 25 daily scratch-offs to $82.50, and Daily A packets for A and B carpoolers will increase from $100 to $125. A and B carpool permit rates will increase slightly from $432 to $453 for an annual permit, with the cost split between the carpool members. A and B one- through four-day limited permit prices will also go up a slightly, with increases ranging from $2 to $10 over last year's rates, depending on the number of days the permit is valid.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Employees in the Research Support (RX), Technical (TX), and Clerical (CX) bargaining units will not be affected by the parking fee changes until such time agreements regarding parking fees are reached between the University and the organizations which exclusively represent employees in these bargaining units. Employees in these bargaining units should direct their questions to Labor Relations, (831) 459-2017.<br>

<p>
  UCSC has received a $2.2 million grant from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation to establish a state-of-the-art facility for marine microbiology research.
</p>
<p>
  The new laboratory, operated by the Institute of Marine Sciences, will support the work of UCSC researchers as well as their collaborators and visiting scientists from other institutions.
</p>
<p>
  "Marine microbiology is an exciting new area of ocean investigation, and it's a real honor that the Moore Foundation has chosen UCSC to set up a top laboratory for research in this important field," said Gary Griggs, director of the Institute of Marine Sciences and principal investigator on the grant.
</p>
<p>
  The grant will provide equipment and staff for a "microbial genomics experimentation and remote sensing laboratory," which will be housed in the Earth and Marine Sciences Building. Jonathan Zehr, professor of ocean sciences, is co-principal investigator and will be a major user of the new facility. The Moore Foundation named Zehr a senior investigator in its marine microbiology initiative last year, supporting his research with a five-year, $4.2 million grant.
</p>
<p>
  Marine microorganisms are not easy to study because they are small and difficult to isolate and grow in the laboratory. Yet vast numbers of them swarm in every cup of seawater.
</p>
<p>
  "There are thousands of important microorganisms out there that we've never gotten into a culture flask. So we need to be able to characterize individual cells or characterize the genetic material directly from the ocean without cultivating the organisms, and this new facility will have equipment to help us do that," Zehr said.
</p>
<p>
  Zehr has made important discoveries about marine microorganisms that "fertilize" the oceans by converting nitrogen gas into a form that other organisms can use, a process known as "nitrogen fixation." He is currently developing genetic probes that can be deployed on moored platforms in the ocean to automatically detect the presence of nitrogen-fixing microbes in the water. This project involves a close collaboration with Chris Scholin, a molecular biologist at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI) in Moss Landing.
</p>
<p>
  "The new facility will strengthen our ties with MBARI and support our collaborative work on a project that is really on the cutting edge of marine microbiology," Zehr said.
</p>
<p>
  Also involved in the project are UCSC oceanographers Raphael Kudela, an associate professor of ocean sciences, and Christopher Edwards, an assistant professor. Kudela and Edwards will use information from the probes and other oceanographic data from remote sensing to try to understand the factors that govern the distribution and large-scale patterns of nitrogen-fixing microorganisms in the ocean.
</p>
<p>
  Ultimately, they hope to develop computer models that can use information from ocean monitoring and remote sensing to make predictions about the growth patterns of marine microorganisms.
</p>
<p>
  Although relatively little is known about the ocean's microbial communities, researchers have found that they are enormously important to marine ecology, the availability and transformations of key nutrients, and even the global climate.
</p>
<p>
  "Marine microorganisms catalyze all the major biochemical transformations on the planet, they help maintain nutrient availability, and they are also a rich source of genetic information, some of which may be useful for biotechnology," Zehr said.
</p>
<p>
  "There is a lot of interest in marine microbes now, because people have realized that the ocean is a huge untapped resource of genes and microorganisms that we know very little about," he added.
</p>
<p>
  The equipment in the new facility will include a flow cytometer, a sophisticated tool that uses laser beams to characterize single cells as they pass through at high speeds, processing and sorting thousands of cells in just a few seconds. The facility will also have a laboratory for cultivation and genomics experiments, as well as a powerful bioinformatics computer cluster for performing genetic analyses.
</p>
<p>
  In addition to Zehr, researchers in environmental toxicology and other departments at UCSC are also expected to make use of the facility, Griggs said.
</p>
<p>
  "It is a multi-user facility, so it will benefit a lot of people on campus and will also attract visiting scientists to UCSC," Griggs said.
</p>
<p>
  The Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation was established in November 2000 by Intel cofounder Gordon Moore and his wife Betty to create positive outcomes for future generations. The foundation funds outcome-based grants and initiatives to achieve significant and measurable results. Grant making supports the foundation's principal areas of concern: environmental conservation, science, higher education, and the San Francisco Bay Area. The foundation launched its 10-year marine microbiology initiative in April 2004, with the goal of attaining new knowledge regarding the composition, function, and ecological role of microbial communities in the world's oceans.

        <title>Landmark study highlights the importance of 'junk' DNA in higher organism</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 25 Jul 2005 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>

        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  A team led by researchers at UCSC's Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering (CBSE) has published a landmark study comparing the genomes of a range of different organisms. The study, published in the journal <i>Genome Research,</i> describes the most comprehensive comparison to date of conserved DNA sequences in the genomes of vertebrates, insects, worms, and yeast.
</p>
<p>
  One of the study's major findings is that as organism complexity increases, so too does the proportion of conserved bases in the non-protein-coding (or "junk") DNA sequences. This underscores the importance of gene regulation in more complex species.
</p>
<p>
  The paper also reports exciting biological findings regarding highly conserved DNA elements and the development of a new computational tool for comparing several whole-genome sequences. The first author on the paper is Adam Siepel, a graduate student working with David Haussler, professor of biomolecular engineering and director of the CBSE. The coauthors include investigators from Pennsylvania State University, Washington University School of Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, and UCSC.
</p>
<p>
  One of the most powerful approaches for pinpointing biologically relevant elements in genomic DNA is to identify sequences that are similar across multiple species. Such approaches are particularly useful for analyzing non-protein-coding sequences--sometimes called "junk" DNA. Although "junk" DNA is poorly understood, the increasing availability of whole-genome sequences is rapidly enhancing the ability of scientists to ascertain the biological significance of these non-protein-coding regions.
</p>
<p>
  "Looking for functional elements in mammalian and other vertebrate genomes is like looking for needles in a haystack," explained Siepel. "By focusing on conserved elements, you get a much smaller haystack. It's not guaranteed to have every needle in it, and not everything in it is a needle, but you're much more likely to find a needle if you look in this smaller haystack than if you look in the big one."
</p>
<p>
  Siepel's team aligned whole-genome sequences for four groups of eukaryotic species (vertebrates, insects, worms, and yeast). The vertebrates included human, mouse, rat, chicken, and puffer fish, and the insects included three species of fruit fly and one species of mosquito. Two worm species and seven yeast species rounded out the set.
</p>
<p>
  To help ease the gargantuan task of identifying conserved elements in multiple alignments of whole-genome sequences, the researchers developed a new computational tool called phastCons. In contrast to traditional tools that compute conservation levels based on sequence similarity at each nucleotide position, phastCons allows for multiple substitutions per site, accounts for unequal rates of substitutions for different nucleotides, and considers the phylogenetic relationships of the species involved.
</p>
<p>
  After applying phastCons to multiple alignments of each of the four groups of eukaryotic species, the researchers estimated that only 3 to 8 percent of the human genome was conserved in the other vertebrate species. On the other hand, the more compact genomes of insects were more highly conserved (37 to 53 percent), as were those of worms (18 to 37 percent) and yeast (47 to 68 percent).
</p>
<p>
  The scientists also observed that the proportion of conserved sequences located outside of protein-coding regions tended to increase with genome length and with the species' general biological complexity.
</p>
<p>
  Most strikingly, the researchers discovered that two-thirds or more of the conserved DNA sequences in vertebrate and insect species were located outside the exons of protein-coding genes, while non-protein-coding sequences accounted for only about 40 percent and 15 percent of the conserved elements in the genomes of worms and yeast, respectively.
</p>
<p>
  "The conserved noncoding story seems to be fairly similar in vertebrates and insects, but looks quite different in worms and yeast," explained Siepel. "These findings support the hypothesis that increased biological complexity in vertebrates and insects derives more from elaborate forms of regulation than from a larger number of protein-coding genes."
</p>
<p>
  He noted that the results for the worm group should be interpreted cautiously because the analysis was based on the genomes of only two quite divergent worm species.
</p>
<p>
  "We still understand remarkably little about the function and evolutionary origin of these elements," Haussler added.
</p>
<p>
  But the locations of the conserved elements will provide the scientists with some key clues to the potential functions of these sequences.
</p>
<p>
  For genomic scientists, the current study is a major contribution to the field. Not only will the new bioinformatics tool phastCons help researchers identify evolutionarily conserved DNA elements, the reported conserved elements are represented as conservation tracks in the widely used UCSC Genome Browser.
</p>
<p>
  "With phastCons and with the conservation tracks in the browser," says Siepel, "we're trying to make it as easy as possible for researchers to home in on functionally important DNA sequences."
</p>
<p>
  In addition to Siepel and Haussler, other UCSC researchers who contributed to the paper include Gill Bejerano, Angie Hinrichs, Kate Rosenbloom, Hiram Clawson, and James Kent. The paper appeared online on July 15 and will be published in the August print issue of <i>Genome Research.</i>

<p>
  During seismic renovation of the Hahn Student Services Building the Financial Aid Office will relocate to Baskin 391A. Office entry will be off the third-floor patio.
</p>
<p>
  The Financial Aid Office will be closed on Tuesday, August 2, and Wednesday, August 3, for the move. Faxes and phones will not be operational those days.
</p>
<p>
  Phone and in-person services will resume on Thursday, August 4. There will be no change in phone or fax numbers or mailing addresses. Paper mail will be automatically delivered to the new location by campus mail services.
</p>
<p>
  The seismic work on Hahn is expected to take approximately a year.

<p>
  Craig Haney, professor of psychology and an expert on incarceration, testified before the National Commission on Safety and Abuse in America's Prisons earlier this month.
</p>
<p>
  Haney participated in a panel that addressed crowded prison facilities, discussing the research on social density and the links between crowding and what Haney calls "institutional pathology." He discussed the interconnectedness of crowding, understaffing, underdeveloped leadership, and underresourced facilities, and explained how crowding contributes to the creation of institutions where violence and abuse are likely and/or tolerated.
</p>
<p>
  Haney provided a 10-minute opening statement and fielded questions from commissioners and other expert witnesses during the 90-minute session. He also submitted a written statement in advance of his testimony. Haney appeared with Vincent Nathan, an attorney and consultant, and Richard Stalder, the secretary of Louisiana's Department of Public Safety and Corrections and president of the Association of State Correctional Administrators.
</p>
<p>
  Other panels focused on the size and demographics of the prison population, personal accounts of crowding and isolation, and physical and mental health care in prisons.
</p>
<p>
  The two-day hearing took place July 19-20 in Newark, New Jersey.

<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  The sixth annual UC Systemwide Bioengineering Symposium, held at UCSC in June, brought together a broad range of scientists and students to exchange ideas and share recent advances in the field of bioengineering.
</p>
<p>
  The three-day symposium, "Envisioning the Biomedical Future," included 172 participants from the biotechnology industry, the National Institutes of Health, and all of the UC campuses.
</p>
<p>
  Speakers throughout the symposium showed how advances in biomolecular engineering are shaping the biomedical future. A number of UCSC researchers are among those at the forefront of these developments.
</p>
<p>
  "I am very pleased to see that UCSC's pioneering bioinformatics and bioengineering research programs are greatly enhancing our understanding at the biomolecular level," said Steve Kang, dean of UCSC's Baskin School of Engineering.
</p>
<p>
  The symposium chair, professor of electrical engineering Wentai Liu, directs the research activities at UCSC of the multi-institutional Center for Biomimetic MicroElectronic Systems. The retinal prosthesis he and his collaborators have invented to restore sight to the blind was among the research projects presented at the symposium.
</p>
<p>
  David Haussler, professor of biomolecular engineering at UCSC and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator, described new understanding being gained at the edges of genome science through computer analysis of genome evolution. Haussler's research has also contributed to two other projects highlighted at the symposium--nanopore technology for DNA analysis and microarrays for detecting genetic variations.
</p>
<p>
  The ability to sequence an individual's genome for less than $1,000 is a major goal of genome scientists, and nanopore technology has the potential to make personal genome sequencing available for as little as $100, said Jim Hollenhorst, molecular technology lab director at Agilent Laboratories. Nanopore technology is being developed at UCSC by David Deamer, professor of chemistry and biochemistry and acting chair of biomolecular engineering, and Mark Akeson, associate adjunct professor of biomolecular engineering. Their device employs an electric field to pull individual DNA molecules through a tiny pore, resulting in distinctive signals that can be used to identify different DNA molecules.
</p>
<p>
  Stephen Fodor, president and CEO of Affymetrix Laboratories, described methods for decreasing the cost of detecting genetic variations between individuals through the use of microarrays (also called "gene chips"). One common type of genetic variation is known as a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), and a new 96-well plate containing microarray chips can test for all of the known SNPs in the human genome, Fodor said.
</p>
<p>
  "Through the use of microarrays, we can discover the genetic basis for variation in health among humans," he said.
</p>
<p>
  Many biomedical researchers are intent on understanding and targeting individual differences in susceptibility to disease and responses to drugs. Roderic Pettigrew, director of the National Institute for Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), described how research under way now will enable personalized medicine in the near future. He lauded nanotechnology advances that have improved cellular and molecular imaging and have paved the way for targeted drug delivery systems, which are already showing promise in cancer treatment.
</p>
<p>
  Pettigrew went on to describe advances in regenerative medicine, where manufactured tissues infused with cells, developmental nutrients, and growth stimulants can help regenerate nerves or restore tissues. He also credited advances in computing, bioinformatics, and imaging for opening the way to improved patient care in the future. For example, image-guided intervention can improve outcomes in microsurgery and make it easier to do targeted brain surgery.
</p>
<p>
  Wireless technology under development at the Alfred Mann Foundation may lead to a new generation of implantable devices for restoring movement to paralyzed muscles, according to the foundation's president and chief scientist Joseph Schulman. Wireless technology could reduce the risk of infection from implanted wires, which has hindered earlier approaches to electrical muscle stimulation, and would also reduce the expense and difficulty of the surgery to implant the stimulators, Schulman said.
</p>
<p>
  A number of speakers commented on the dramatic increase in the need for elder care expected in the decades to come.
</p>
<p>
  "Elder care is returning home," said Terry Dishongh, senior staff researcher and lead hardware engineer of the Intel Corporation Proactive Health Research Team.
</p>
<p>
  Dishong described a home monitoring system to make it possible for caregivers to monitor elders' well-being from a distance, even as the elders continue to live on their own. "Connecting all of the various digital devices people now use can help show whether people are well," he said.
</p>
<p>
  Home monitoring systems promise to reduce the cost of care while increasing the quality and connectedness of elders' lives, Dishongh said. They show particular promise for elders suffering from memory impairments, because the systems feature feedback and reminder systems.
</p>
<p>
  Symposium participants got a crash course in the business end of bioengineering technology from Rick Ellinger, managing director of the venture capital firm Innovation Growth Partners. Cures for disease, he said, are one of the "irresistible forces of demand." He went on to say that university-based scientists must adapt to the different way of thinking in business environments. Whereas "publish or perish" drives the grant-driven academic world, the counterpart in industry is "demo or die," Ellinger said. To gain venture funding, scientists must show the practical applications of their research.
</p>
<p>
  "A demonstrated science experiment is not a scalable production process," he said.
</p>
<p>
  Ellinger indicated that venture capitalists also need reeducation to appreciate the bioengineering world. They need to understand that nanotech and biotech do not require the high level of funding needed to bring products to market in the semiconductor industry. With biotech, he said, "you can accomplish a lot with less funding from a bottom-up approach."
</p>
<p>
  Dean Kang expressed enthusiasm for the merging of engineering and biomedical science.
</p>
<p>
  "Bioinformatics will be key to improving medicine, by making it more quantitative. If you want to build a plane or a car, you need excellent analysis. Bringing that same rigor to medicine will lead to improvements," Kang said.
</p>
<p>
  William Heetderks, associate director for extramural science programs at NIBIB, summed up the general tone of the symposium when he said, "This is the 21st century. We expect that we are going to be able to do something about disease."
</p>
<p>
  The symposium was organized by the UCSC branch of the Bioengineering Institute of California, UCSC's Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering, and the UCSC branch of the California Institute for Quantitative Biomedical Research (QB3).

<p>
  A team of engineering students whose high-flying weather balloon plunged into the Pacific Ocean this spring got a crucial assist from engineers at SanDisk Corporation, who salvaged valuable data from flash memory cards that had spent days immersed in saltwater.
</p>
<p>
  As a result, the students completed a highly successful senior project, and the astronomical observatories that sponsored the project now have information that will help them focus more clearly on the stars.
</p>
<p>
  This remarkable chain of events began when the students, all seniors in engineering at UCSC, released a helium-filled balloon with instruments that included atmosphere probes, a transmitter, a digital camera, and a custom-built data recorder. Both the camera and the recorder used SanDisk SD(tm) flash memory cards to capture images and continuous telemetry readings.
</p>
<p>
  Calling themselves Team BAT (for Balloon Atmospheric Telemetry), the students launched their balloon in early March from a softball field in Watsonville. Their intent was for it to rise 75,000 feet and continually record information on turbulence, including temperature, humidity, pressure, altitude, longitude, and latitude. These are parameters that enable astronomers to measure light refraction from the atmosphere and adjust their telescopes for the clearest image.
</p>
<p>
  With a GPS device giving the balloon's position, the students were able to track its flight path for about two hours. They were expecting it to reach maximum elevation before deploying a parachute and settling gently back to Earth. But things suddenly went haywire. A burst of wind pushed the balloon and its payload of electronics over the ocean, where it ultimately ruptured and splashed into the waves about two miles offshore from Pajaro Dunes, presumably never to be seen again. Team BAT was ready to scratch the mission as a failure after gleaning only erratic bits of data from the transmitter.
</p>
<p>
  But fortune prevailed. Five days after the balloon disappeared, a beachgoer found the apparatus washed ashore about 20 miles north of where it had dropped into the ocean, and called the university. When the students arrived, they saw that the small padded lunch bag containing the circuit board for the telemetry equipment--and a SanDisk 1-gigabyte (GB) standard SD memory card--were thoroughly soaked by saltwater. Nearby were the shattered remains of the digital camera, which had been separated from the bag. Amazingly, the memory card, a SanDisk 128-megabyte (MB) standard SD card, was among the rubble.
</p>
<p>
  Back at their UCSC lab, the excited students dried out the card from the camera, slipped it into a card reader on a PC, and observed a string of breathtaking, high-elevation photos, the last one shot at 40,000 feet. Not a single image was lost. But the SanDisk SD card from the data recording device was completely unreadable. So Dave Van Unen, engineering lab staff for UCSC's Jack Baskin School of Engineering, sent the card to SanDisk as a last resort.
</p>
<p>
  After a week of repeatedly scanning the card with a special reading device and getting intermittent errors, Ysabel Tran, a technician in SanDisk's engineering lab, was finally able to extract all of the data on the card. She transferred it to another SD card, which was immediately relayed to Team BAT.
</p>
<p>
  UCSC engineering student Roberto Menchaca said that although his group estimated a peak altitude of 60,000 feet for the balloon, in fact the card data recovered by SanDisk showed a maximum of 81,863 feet--far above the original objective. And while the balloon transmitter radioed just 1,028 samples of data, the card yielded a whopping 53,406 samples.

  "This gave us more accurate data and, just as important, it was continuous, whereas the data we received by radio was full of gaps," he said.
</p>
<p>
  Elated at their now successful project, the students presented their report to the observatories. Members of the team, apart from Menchaca, consisted of project leader Skye Vendt-Pearce, Bartolo Alvarado, Amanuel Mengistu, and Kathy Phan. When graduation ceremonies were held in early June, Alvarado received both the Dean's Award and the Chancellor's Award--a rare double honor--and Mengistu received the Dean's Award.

  "We're delighted that we were able to assist these aspiring engineers and thus contribute to the space program," said Nelson Chan, SanDisk's executive vice president and general manager for consumer and handset business. "This amazing series of events once again demonstrate the durability of SanDisk's flash memory cards."
</p>
<p>
  John Vesecky, professor of electrical engineering and the faculty mentor of the student team, said the overall project was commissioned by UC's Lick Observatory and the Palomar Observatory in southern California and funded by Cal Space, a state grant program that promotes space-related education within the university system.
</p>
<p>
  "The students were measuring variations in atmospheric turbulence--essentially wind shear," said Vesecky. "These are little fluctuations in air temperature that occur in sizes of from 10 centimeters to a few hundred meters. They are like eddies in the atmosphere and they create distortion--the 'twinkling' in the stars that people see from Earth--and generate fuzzy images for telescopes. It's like looking at lights through a swimming pool."
</p>
<p>
  By using the student balloon data, land-based astronomers can begin to profile the layers of turbulence and improve their ability to compensate for them using a process called adaptive optics. UCSC is a leader in the field of adaptive optics, with a major Laboratory for Adaptive Optics as well as the headquarters of the national Center for Adaptive Optics both located on campus.
</p>
<p>
  Another student balloon was launched in June and a third may be released this fall, said Vesecky.
</p>

  SanDisk is the original inventor of flash storage cards and is the world's largest supplier of flash data storage card products, using its patented, high-density flash memory and controller technology. SanDisk is headquartered in Sunnyvale, CA, and has operations worldwide, with more than half of its sales outside the U.S.

<p>
  Astronomers have discovered an extrasolar planet with the largest core of any known planet. The discovery is especially exciting to planet formation theorists, because it provides extremely strong observational evidence in support of the "core accretion" theory, one of two main theories for how giant planets form.
</p>
<p>
  The findings were made by a consortium of American, Japanese, and Chilean astronomers led by Debra Fischer of San Francisco State University and Gregory Laughlin of UCSC.
</p>
<p>
  A paper about the discovery has been accepted for publication in the <i>Astrophysical Journal</i>.
</p>
<p>
  "We started this project with the hope of finding an object like this," said Laughlin, a professor of astronomy and astrophysics. "There is a raging debate over the mechanism that formed Jupiter and the giant planets found around other stars. This planet could only have formed through some variation on the core accretion process, so it is extraordinary evidence in favor of that theory."
</p>
<p>
  The astronomers initially detected the planet by measuring the tiny wobble that its gravitational tug induces in the host star. They were then able to make valuable observations of the planet as it passed in front of the star.
</p>
<p>
  "This planet passes in front of its star and dims the starlight," said Debra Fischer, a professor of astronomy at SFSU and team leader for the consortium. "When that happens, we are able to calculate the physical size of the planet, whether it has a solid core, and even what the planet atmosphere is like."
</p>
<p>
  The planet, orbiting the Sun-like star HD 149026, takes just 2.87 days to circle around its star. It is roughly equal in mass to Saturn, but it is significantly smaller in diameter.
</p>
<p>
  "We all expected a much larger planet, similar to Jupiter," said Bun'ei Sato, a postdoctoral fellow at Okayama Astrophysical Observatory and first author of the paper. "None of our models predicted that nature could make a planet like this."
</p>
<p>
  Modeling of the planet's structure by Peter Bodenheimer, a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC, showed that the planet has a solid core that is about 70 times the mass of Earth.
</p>
<p>
  "Its total mass is close to Saturn's, but it has a much larger core," Bodenheimer said.
</p>
<p>
  "For theorists, the discovery of a planet with such a large core is as important as the discovery of the first extrasolar planet around the star 51 Pegasi in 1995," said Shigeru Ida, a theorist from the Tokyo Institute of Technology.
</p>
<p>
  Scientists have two competing but viable theories for how planets arise from the "protoplanetary disk" of gas and dust around a star. In the first theory, planets form when a dense cloud of gas collapses due to gravitational instability in the disk. In the second, planets start as small cores of rock and ice that grow as they gravitationally acquire additional mass; when the core attains a certain critical mass, it begins to collect a gas envelope around it.
</p>
<p>
  According to Laughlin, the massive core of the newly discovered planet could not have formed from a collapsing cloud of gas. The planet must have grown a core first, and then acquired gas.
</p>
<p>
  "With a core of 70 Earth masses, there is really no way this planet could form through gravitational instability," Laughlin said.
</p>
<p>
  Bodenheimer noted that the core of this planet is so unexpectedly massive it even poses challenges for the core accretion model. Nevertheless, he said, the evidence now strongly favors that theory over gravitational instability.
</p>
<p>
  "The fact that the core is so massive may have to do with the heavy-element composition of the star, which is twice that of the Sun. So its disk probably had more solid material in it, allowing the planet to build up a bigger core," Bodenheimer said.
</p>
<p>
  The researchers involved in this study are part of an international consortium established to survey "the next 2000" closest and brightest stars with "high metallicity" (meaning a composition rich in heavy elements). Called the N2K survey, it is focusing on these metal-rich stars because they are more likely than metal-poor stars to have rocky planets around them, Laughlin said.
</p>
<p>
  Three of Laughlin's graduate students and an undergraduate researcher at UCSC made significant contributions to the project and are coauthors on the paper. Graduate student Mark Ammons developed statistical tools he used to mine astronomical databases and come up with a catalog of candidate stars for the survey. Two other graduate students, Sarah Robinson and Jay Strader, are performing preliminary observations of the candidate stars identified by Ammons, using the Nickel Telescope at Lick Observatory on Mt. Hamilton.
</p>
<p>
  "Because observing time on the large telescopes is so valuable, you need an intermediate step to evaluate the candidate stars and determine if they are suitable for study. So they developed techniques to squeeze valuable information out of the spectra they can obtain quickly at Mt. Hamilton," Laughlin said.
</p>
<p>
  Aaron Wolf, an undergraduate physics major at UCSC, developed a software program that helps the researchers interpret the data obtained from observations of the stars.
</p>
<p>
  The consortium detected the "wobble" of the star from radial velocity measurements obtained at the Subaru Telescope and the W. M. Keck Observatory, both located on Mauna Kea in Hawaii. Follow-up observations of the dimming of the star by the planet were obtained by Gregory Henry at the Fairborn Observatory in Arizona.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_7204" align="alignright" width="220"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/07/rohde_marc.220.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7204" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/07/rohde_marc.220.jpg" alt="Marc Rohde on a recent visit to Filoli Gardens Photo: Gary Cunningham" width="220" height="243" /></a>Marc Rohde on a recent visit to Filoli Gardens Photo: Gary Cunningham[/caption]

<p>
  Marc Rohde, a groundskeeper at UCSC for a number of years, died at his home in Prunedale on July 7. He was 51.
</p>
<p>
  Marc was hired by UCSC in 1987 and worked as a groundskeeper until ill health forced him to take a disability retirement in April 2001. The majority of his career was spent at Stevenson College.
</p>
<p>
  Marc was very knowledgeable about plants and garden design, and shared his expertise with all who expressed an interest. He made many friends on campus, and his work beautifying the grounds was greatly appreciated by those who worked at Stevenson, said Lynn Galiste, manager of the Philosophy Department.
</p>
<p>
  In his free time, Marc played in many bands, including one group with his coworker and friend Gary Cunningham. He was also an artist in bonsai, and he had a knack with cartoon caricatures.
</p>
<p>
  A memorial service will be held for Marc on July 23 at the Cowell Provost's House from 1 to 4 p.m. If you would like to attend, wear a Hawaian shirt and bring some flowers--he loved both!

        <title>Department of Energy grants fund work on new hydrogen fuel technologies</title>

  By <a href="mailto:stephens@ucsc.edu">Tim Stephens</a><br>
</p>
<p>
  Nanotechnology may hold the key to developing a viable hydrogen economy, according to Jin Zhang, professor of chemistry and biochemistry.
</p>
<p>
  <a name="OLE_LINK2" id="OLE_LINK2"></a> Zhang will receive $535,000 in grants from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for his part in two research projects aimed at developing new technologies for the production and storage of hydrogen fuel using nanostructured materials.
</p>
<p>
  Producing hydrogen from water using solar energy is the focus of one of the projects. Zhang is leading that effort and is also a coinvestigator on a second project to develop a method for highly efficient hydrogen storage. Both of the three-year projects rely on a novel approach to create nanostructured materials with special properties. Nanostructure refers to dimensions on the scale of billionths of a meter.
</p>
<p>
  "The goal is to produce clean energy," Zhang said. "The idea of using solar energy and water as a source of hydrogen is very attractive, and we believe nanostructured materials can be used to do this efficiently."
</p>
<p>
  The grants are among 70 hydrogen research projects funded through a $64 million DOE initiative aimed at making vehicles powered by hydrogen fuel cells available, practical, and affordable for American consumers by 2020. Zhang's collaborators on the hydrogen production project are Yiping Zhao of the University of Georgia at Athens and Wei Chen of Nomadics Inc. The hydrogen storage project is headed by Zhao and also involves Matthew McCluskey of Washington State University.
</p>
<p>
  Hydrogen offers an attractive alternative to fossil fuels because it is highly efficient and clean. But major technological hurdles must be overcome to make the use of hydrogen fuel practical.
</p>
<p>
  The first hurdle is how to produce the hydrogen. Water molecules can be split to form pure hydrogen and oxygen using electricity (a process called electrolysis). But the environmental advantages of hydrogen would be lost if the electricity used to generate it came from burning fossil fuels. Using solar energy to split water and generate hydrogen is not a new concept, but Zhang says his team's approach could lead to a device efficient enough for practical use.
</p>
<p>
  "We want to build a device that you can put in the sun, fill it with water, and get hydrogen without using any outside source of energy," Zhang said.
</p>
<p>
  The device will integrate two kinds of solar cells--a photovoltaic cell to produce electricity and a photoelectrochemical cell to produce hydrogen from the electrolysis of water. Both will use specially designed materials based on arrays of nanowires with uniform orientation. The main focus of the project will be on developing these nanostructured materials to optimize the efficiency of both the photovoltaic cell and the photoelectrochemical cell.
</p>
<p>
  The researchers will use a technique called glancing angle deposition (GLAD) to fabricate the nanowire arrays. Zhao is an expert on the use of this technique for making nanowires and nanorods. Zhang's lab will focus on characterizing the structure and properties of the materials Zhao makes and evaluating their suitability for achieving the highest possible efficiencies for the photovoltaic cell and the photoelectrochemical cell.
</p>
<p>
  The hydrogen storage project will also involve using the GLAD technique to fabricate nanostructured materials. One of the problems with hydrogen as a fuel is that it is a bulky gas that is not easily transported and stored. A promising solution is to store it in a solid form as a metal hydride compound. Metal hydride nanostructures could greatly improve the efficiency of this type of storage, Zhang said.
</p>
<p>
  "Nanostructures have a much larger surface area than bulk materials, so they could hold more hydrogen per unit weight," he said.
</p>
<p>
  The researchers plan to find the optimum conditions for fabricating metal hydride nanostructures to achieve highly efficient hydrogen storage.
</p>
<p>
  "The key to our success in each of these projects is the material. We need to understand the properties of these materials and then explore their applications in devices," Zhang said.

<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  Kelvin Filer grew up in the Compton neighborhood of Los Angeles in the 1960s, and he says his home was always abuzz with conversations about civil rights and the struggle for racial equality.
</p>
<p>
  "My parents were both civil rights activists, and as a child, I'd listen in when the adults were talking strategy," recalls Filer. "Their discussions always ended the same way, asking 'What do the lawyers say? Let's run this by the attorneys.' That's when I decided I wanted to be a lawyer."
</p>
<p>
  He was in the third grade. Today, Filer is a highly regarded judge in the Compton district of Los Angeles Superior Court, dispensing justice with integrity and compassion.
</p>
<p>
  "No other profession ever crossed my mind--except basketball, and I knew that wasn't going to happen unless I grew," says the gregarious Filer, a diehard Lakers fan who stands 5 foot 10. "If I'd been 6' 3"..."
</p>
<p>
  For 25 years, Filer has been making his mark in court rather than on the court, including arguing a landmark case before the California Supreme Court at the age of 27 that established the right of all defendants to wear their own clothes in court.
</p>
<p>
  Filer credits his parents with motivating him to succeed. His father, Maxcy Filer, started out parking cars for the city of Los Angeles, but he went to night school, studied law, and eventually joined his son's law practice. "My parents encouraged me, and I knew if I wanted to be a lawyer, I'd need to go to college and do well in school," said Filer, who earned a B.A. in politics from UCSC in 1977 and graduated from UC Berkeley's Boalt Hall School of Law.
</p>
<p>
  Filer was drawn to UCSC by the Narrative Evaluation System, the focus on liberal arts, and the absence of fraternities. He was one of only four African American students at Stevenson College his freshman year. The contrast could not have been greater for Filer, who came from Compton High School, where most of the 750 students were black. He recalls feeling physically and culturally isolated at first.
</p>
<p>
  "I remember when I first drove up the hill to High Street, and I asked myself, 'Where is the school? Oh, no, what am I getting myself into?'" But Filer loved the school. "Because there were only 150 or so black students out of 6,000, we were <em>tight</em>," he says. "I really enjoyed it."
</p>
<p>
  Filer thrived in UCSC's student-centered living and learning environment. "For me, it wasn't so much about the professors as it was about learning from each other," says Filer. Nevertheless, an experience during the Stevenson College core course stands out in his memory. "After the first assignment, the professor told me I had serious problems understanding Marxian concepts, and that really shook me up. No teacher had ever said anything like that to me before," he says. "I was determined to show him--and to show myself--that I could do it." Later in the quarter, Filer turned in a paper that the professor described as one of the best he'd ever read.
</p>
<p>
  That drive to succeed served Filer well in law school, where he suspected many of his fellow students thought they were smarter than he was. "I wanted to show them they weren't," he says in the same upbeat tone in which he discusses his attachment to his hometown.
</p>
<p>
  "I was born, raised, and educated in Compton. This is where I'm from and where my family is from," says Filer, who visits classrooms every week to encourage students to work hard and follow their dreams. "I may not be able to change the world, but I may be able to change my little corner of it."
</p>
<p>
  After law school, Filer spent two years working in the state Public Defender's Office in Los Angeles before opening a private practice in Compton.
</p>
<p>
  "I love the practice of law," he says. "I love the challenge of representing the underdog, having them put their trust in you as you go up against the mighty people of the state of California. It's a lot of pressure, especially in death penalty cases."
</p>
<p>
  Over the years, Filer represented six clients charged with capital crimes. One is on death row, three had their cases dismissed, and two were convicted of lesser crimes. The dismissals were innocent--"Absolutely," he responds with zeal. But Filer doesn't shy away from the unpleasant reality that legal wrongdoing at times results in guilty individuals being released.
</p>
<p>
  "That's the irony, isn't it? But anyone doing criminal defense work will tell you that everybody has the right to a fair trial," says Filer. "That's what makes ours the best legal system in the world. Our appeals system is designed to make sure any wrongs are corrected, regardless of who was wronged."
</p>
<p>
  Filer's landmark California Supreme Court case, <i>People vs. Taylor</i>, established the right of the accused to wear street clothes in court, rather than "jail blues," which could prejudice jurors. The court's 8-0 decision reversed Alonzo Taylor's murder conviction, but Taylor was never released because in the interim he had been arrested and charged with another murder. Taylor ultimately was convicted and remains in custody.
</p>
<p>
  Filer practiced law for 13 years before moving to the bench in 1993. He misses some aspects of criminal litigation, particularly presenting closing arguments and cross-examining witnesses. "I love catching a witness in a lie. You can hear a pin drop," he says, clearly savoring the memory. "And I love the thrill of victory!"
</p>
<p>
  But Filer relishes his role as a judge and enjoys being a role model. His daughter, Kree, appears destined for a career in law. His other daughter, Brynne, is a student at Sarah Lawrence College.
</p>
<p>
  Although he moved to nearby Long Beach after being named to the Superior Court bench in 2002 by then-Governor Gray Davis (it's frowned upon for judges to live in the same community where they work), Filer is frustrated by media coverage of Compton, which focuses on crime, violence, and corruption. Success stories never get the media attention they warrant, says Filer, rattling off a list of illustrious Comptonites, from tennis stars Venus and Serena Williams to Michael Hamilton, an executive with Ameritech Corporation, and Timothy Wright, a former aide to Bill Clinton.
</p>
<p>
  Add one more name to that list: Kelvin Filer.

[caption id="attachment_7772" align="alignright" width="230"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/07/dynes_denton.05-07-11.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-7772" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/07/dynes_denton.05-07-11.jpg" alt="" width="230" height="170" /></a>[/caption]

<p>
  During a recent visit to UCSC, UC President Robert Dynes told a group of high school math and science students about the thrill of discovery he felt as a graduate student in physics.
</p>
<p>
  "I was measuring the energy gap of this particular superconductor. It was the first time it had ever been measured," recalled Dynes, describing an experiment he conducted late one freezing February night in Hamilton, Ontario. "I was walking home, and I realized I knew something that nobody else in the world knew. That was the most unbelievable experience I have ever had. I didn't even hear the snow crunch under my feet."
</p>
<p>
  Encouraging the crowd to continue their studies, Dynes told the students, "I truly wish I were in your shoes. Not only because you're 15 years old, but because I have a sense of what's in front of you--the joy you're going to experience as you grow physically and intellectually."
</p>
<p>
  Dynes visited UCSC during a two-day tour of the Central Coast region. On June 30, he attended a reception at the Steinbeck Center in Salinas with about 125 UC alumni and a dinner with about 60 representatives of business, politics, and education. At UCSC, Dynes and UCSC Chancellor Denice D. Denton got a firsthand look at UC's California State Summer School in Mathematics and Science, known as COSMOS, a four-week residential program for talented high school students across the state. In its sixth year, COSMOS began at UCSC and UC Irvine but is now offered by UC Davis and the San Diego campus as well.
</p>
<p>
  Dynes and Denton joined about 16 students for a lesson about Einstein's theory of relativity before having lunch with the group of nearly 150 COSMOS students and their instructors. After lunch, they visited an engineering class offered to participants in the robotics cluster.
</p>
<p>
  "I had none of the opportunities you are having," Dynes told the crowd during lunch.
</p>
<p>
  Denton, an electrical engineer, told the students that she participated in a Rice University engineering program during the summer before ninth grade. "That made a really big difference to me," said Denton, describing her interactions with faculty, graduate students, and other young people. "It set me on my path to majoring in electrical engineering."
</p>
<p>
  Denton and Dynes encouraged the students to attend the university when they're ready. COSMOS enrolls students who will be entering the ninth through twelfth grade in the fall.
</p>
<p>
  "We truly believe you represent the future of the University of California," said Denton. "You will be the leaders of math, science, and engineering. We want to see you at one of our campuses."
</p>
<p>
  Nearly half the participants are the first in their family to attend college, according to a 2003 survey of COSMOS alumni, and COSMOS has attracted significant funding from outside sources, including industry. UCSC's program seeks to enroll a large number of students from groups that are traditionally underrepresented on UC campuses, said Carrol Moran, director of UCSC's Educational Partnership, which administers COSMOS. Participants develop close bonds, and many alumni gather for reunions, she said.
</p>
<p>
  "Every year, we get a lot of letters from parents, telling us how happy their children were to find other kids like them," said Moran. "So many kids tell us how great it is to meet other kids who want to talk about physics during lunch."

        <title>UCSC desalination project to give cities tools they need to weigh pros and cons</title>

<p>
  As California's population and economy grow, it's just a matter of time until cities are forced to seriously consider desalination to extend their water supplies.
</p>
<p>
  That's the prediction of water expert Brent Haddad, an associate professor of environmental studies at UCSC, who will direct a $2.6 million project to help communities assess the viability of desalination.
</p>
<p>
  The project, which will encompass coastal and inland case studies, has attracted participants and funding from water agencies, environmentalists, consultants, academics, nongovernmental organizations, and a manufacturer of desalination equipment. The Department of Water Resources contributed $909,050 of Proposition 50 funds.
</p>
<p>
  The initiative, the "Water Security, Clean Drinking Water, Coastal and Beach Protection Act of 2002" approved by voters in November 2002, included bonds to fund grants for the desalination of ocean or brackish waters.
</p>
<p>
  "This project is a good example of how we can bring the university's resources to bear on problems of immediate and practical concern to California," said UCSC Chancellor Denice D. Denton.
</p>
<p>
  The goal of the project is to develop a comprehensive planning tool that communities, water-planning agencies, and water providers can use to assess the costs and benefits of desalination relative to other options in their area. Currently, when communities consider potential desalination projects, they have no framework within which to evaluate the pros and cons, said Haddad. Desalination plants remove salt from ocean water, or brackish inland water, by forcing it through a series of membranes and filters.
</p>
<p>
  "In some parts of the world, from Saudi Arabia to the island of Majorca, they depend on desalination," said Haddad. "With more than 7,500 plants operating worldwide, it is definitely a proven and reliable technology. But it is expensive, and each municipality has to weigh the environmental and economic costs and benefits."
</p>
<p>
  Costs have come down over the past decade as technology has become more efficient, but desalination still runs about $500-$2,000 per acre foot of water (325,000 gallons), compared with about $250 per acre foot for water in urban Los Angeles, and $10 per acre foot paid to the federal government by farmers in the Sierra foothills, according to Haddad, the author of <i>Rivers of Gold: Designing Markets to Allocate Water in California</i> (Washington, D.C.: Island Press, 2000).
</p>
<p>
  "Desalination will matter in the next drought," emphasized Haddad. "That's when people will be willing to pay a lot of money for water, because businesses will be at risk. It will impact local economies, public health, and even fire protection in some areas."
</p>
<p>
  A moderate to severe drought now would have even greater impacts than the droughts of 1977 and the early 1990s because the state's population and economy have grown so much since then, noted Haddad, an advocate of a "portfolio approach" to water supply management that reduces risk by tapping multiple sources. "Marin County and Santa Barbara County were very hard-hit by those droughts, and they'd be hard-pressed to manage today," he said. "We need a variety of water supplies in California."
</p>
<p>
  Haddad's comprehensive analysis will link economic aspects of desalination with environmental impacts. Challenges include figuring out how to dispose of leftover salt and how to avoid inadvertently capturing fish in coastal water intakes. However, Haddad identified potential unrecognized environmental benefits of desalination, which could include:
</p>
<p>
  * improved fish habitat due to reduced diversions from rivers, streams, and groundwater<br>
  <br>
  * energy savings and less air pollution if the amount of water being pumped across the state is reduced
</p>
<p>
  * greater protection of high-quality groundwater due to reduced pumping of aquifers
</p>
<p>
  The two-year study will examine other potential social and economic benefits and costs, including the value desalination could offer in terms of drought relief and protection of agricultural lands by reducing municipal demands on water currently used for irrigation. Other factors include the economic impacts of alternative water supply scenarios; the risk-reducing value of a portfolio approach to water supply management; the pros and cons of changing the levels of interdependence between the water supply and power sectors; and the comparative risks of different levels of dependence on technology for water supply.
</p>
<p>
  Participants will also examine the environmental justice aspects of water, working with advocates and organizations to integrate questions of "who pays for water?" and "who gets the best water?" into the analysis.
</p>
<p>
  The framework will incorporate "no project" scenarios, as well as water conservation, reclamation, and reuse alternatives. Two case studies will be prepared, one for the Long Beach Water Department and one for the Inland Empire Utilities Agency; both will identify a full range of potential benefits and costs. In addition, participants hope to provide a preliminary analysis of a desalination project in Monterey County.
</p>
<p>
  The project, entitled "A Comprehensive Economic and Environmental Framework to Fully Assess the Benefits and Costs of Desalination," begins this summer. Other participants include Michael Hanemann, Chancellor's Professor of Agricultural and Resource Economics at UC Berkeley; Robert Wilkinson, who teaches environmental science at UC Santa Barbara; the Long Beach Water Department; the Inland Empire Utilities Agency; the Coachella Valley Water District; the San Diego County Water Authority; and the Monterey Coastal Division of the California-American Water Company. Planning and regulatory agencies include the California Regional Water Quality Control Board of San Diego and the San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission.
</p>
<p>
  Nongovernmental organizations include the California League of Conservation Voters, the Surfrider Foundation, the WateReuse Foundation, and Residents of Pico Rivera for Environmental Justice. Also participating will be Robert Raucher and Elizabeth Strange of Stratus Consulting; Edward Means and Dennis Dickenson of McGuire Environmental; and Poseidon Resources, which manufactures desalination equipment.

  <br>
  By <a href="mailto:stephens@ucsc.edu">Tim Stephens</a><br>
</p>
<p>
  Astronauts aboard the International Space Station are testing a sophisticated voice-operated computer system designed to guide them through complex procedures.
</p>
<p>
  <a name="OLE_LINK13" id="OLE_LINK13"></a>This advanced spoken-dialogue system, called Clarissa, reads the steps of a procedure to an astronaut, answers questions, and responds to spoken commands.
</p>
<p>
  "Instead of scrolling through written procedures on a laptop or handheld computer, they can wear a headset and have their hands and eyes free to focus on the procedure," said project scientist Beth Ann Hockey.
</p>
<p>
  The spoken-dialogue system is one of many NASA projects being carried out through a unique partnership between UCSC and the NASA Ames Research Center. An agreement between UC and NASA in 2003 established the University Affiliated Research Center (UARC) at NASA Ames, where UCSC now manages a wide range of mission-oriented research tasks.
</p>
<p>
  Hockey, a UCSC employee working at NASA Ames under the UARC contract, leads a diverse team of researchers collaborating on the Clarissa project at NASA Ames. Project manager Kim Farrell is with the QSS Group, a private contractor, and lead implementer Manny Rayner is with the International Computer Science Institute, a nonprofit research institute affiliated with UC Berkeley.
</p>
<p>
  The Clarissa spoken-dialogue system was installed on the International Space Station in December, and astronaut John Phillips successfully tested it onboard the space station on June 27. NASA also demonstrated the system at a meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics in Ann Arbor, Michigan, in June.
</p>
<p>
  In addition to reading procedures to the astronauts, Clarissa can answer simple questions, take notes, and display pictures.
</p>
<p>
  "Even in normal circumstances it can be a pain to break from your work to flip through pages or scroll through instructions on a screen. But in microgravity it's a lot worse, because as soon as you let go of something it floats away," Hockey said.
</p>
<p>
  The system could potentially increase the efficiency with which astronauts carry out thousands of operations aboard the space station. These include complex procedures to maintain life-support systems, check out space suits, conduct science experiments, and perform medical exams. Plans call for eventually making Clarissa a feature with all procedures aboard the space station.
</p>
<p>
  Clarissa's capabilities include: allowing the user to correct or undo commands; distinguishing speech intended for it from speech among other people; giving the user spoken context-sensitive help; and a "challenge-verify" mode for safety-critical procedures that confirms with the user that each step has been completed and warns about skipped steps.
</p>
<p>
  These capabilities pave the way for other kinds of spoken-voice interfaces, Hockey said. For example, spoken interaction with robotic assistants may be possible in the future.
</p>
<p>
  Additional information about UARC research on spoken-dialogue systems can be found on the <a href="http://uarc.ucsc.edu/research/info-tech-computer.html">UARC web site</a>. More information about Clarissa is available from NASA at <a href="http://tc.arc.nasa.gov/projects/clarissa">tc.arc.nasa.gov/projects/clarissa</a>.

<p>
  Tickets are still available for the 24th summer season of <a href="http://shakespearesantacruz.org/">Shakespeare Santa Cruz</a> (SSC), running July 20 to August 28 at the UCSC Mainstage Theater and Festival Glen.
</p>
<p>
  Featured in the June 13 issue of <i>Newsweek</i> as one of five respected theater companies in the nation with promising seasons this summer, SSC will present another sterling combination of festive comedy, transformative drama, and wicked satire.
</p>
<p>
  This year's plays include Shakespeare's quintessential comedy <i>Twelfth Night</i> and poetic drama <i>The Winter's Tale</i>, plus W. S. Gilbert's brilliant satire <i>Engaged</i>. The fringe production is <i>The Antipodes</i>, written by Richard Brome in 1636.
</p>
<p>
  <i>Twelfth Night</i> contains some of Shakespeare's best-loved characters, including valiant Viola, lovesick Duke Orsino, Feste the wise fool, the priggish Malvolio, and Sir Toby Belch. It will be directed by P. J. Paparelli--artistic director at Perseverance Theatre in Juneau, Alaska, and former associate director of the Shakespeare Theatre in Washington D.C. Lauded by the <i>Washington Post</i> as "one of the most exciting talents working in Washington today," Paparelli will be making his SSC directorial debut.
</p>
<p>
  <i>The Winter's Tale</i> includes some of Shakespeare's most beautiful imagery in a story involving a jealous king, a mistaken daughter, comic misadventure, loss, love, and reconciliation. Favorite SSC director Tim Ocel (<i>Taming of the Shrew, A Midsummer Night's Dream, Two Gentleman of Verona, As You Like It</i>) directs this production.
</p>
<p>
  <i>Engaged</i> by W. S. Gilbert features an extraordinary gallery of compelling characters caught between the competing attractions of sex and money in a hilarious satire of rampant British materialism and hypocrisy in the 1870s. It will be directed by SSC Artistic Director Paul Whitworth (<i>Princess and the Pea, Gretel & Hansel, Cinderella,</i> and <i>Arms and the Man</i>).
</p>
<p>
  This summer, for the first time, reserved seating is now available in the outdoor Festival Glen. Managing director Marcus Cato also noted other improvements SSC hopes to implement in the next few years--including the construction of a "sunshade" to make matinee performances in the glen more comfortable for the entire audience.
</p>
<p>
  SSC also will offer a variety of extra events and activities to enhance audience appreciation of the 2005 season. These include a free lecture series at the Nickelodeon Theater beginning on July 15; free Saturday backstage tours beginning on August 6; and pre- and post-play discussions with the directors, designers, and actors.
</p>
<p>

<p>
  Tom Vani, vice chancellor for Business and Administrative Services, accepted a campuswide award on behalf of Chancellor Denice D. Denton and one for himself at the <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/sustainabilityconf2005/">Fourth Annual Sustainability Conference</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Hosted by the Chancellor's Sustainability Action Council at UCSC, the June 19-22 conference was designed to provide campus planners and other staff with the tools and knowledge for incorporating "green" practices. Students were also active in conference sessions and planning. Participants came from UC, CSU, and private and community colleges throughout the state. Also taking part were almost 100 participants and presenters, and another 40 exhibitors, from government and industry.
</p>
<p>
  Cassandra Davis, cochairperson of the UCSC Student Environmental Center, presented a certificate for 10,000 kilowatt hours of American Wind Renewable Energy for the campus. The energy, to be transferred to the university's power grid, was issued to UCSC by Energy Action, a coalition of North American organizations. UCSC's Student Environmental Center won the third-place award by collecting more than 1,000 signatures for Energy Action's "Declaration of Independence from Dirty Energy."
</p>
<p>
  When a typical power generator creates power, it creates and sells kilowatt hours. When a Renewable e-Certified power generator creates power, it creates kilowatt hours and "Green Tags" (Green e-Certified Tradable Renewable Certificates).
</p>
<p>
  These are bought and sold as a fluid way for distant businesses, residences, and industries to support renewable power generators such as wind farms, photovoltaics, and biomass generators. The certificate for UCSC ensured the purchase of renewable power and its use in the electrical grid. Each certificate represents all of the environmental attributes or benefits of a specific quantity of renewable generation. (In addition, the conference purchased "Green Tags" to cover UCSC's entire energy use for the four days of the conference.)
</p>
<p>
  Vani's award, from the UCSC Student Environmental Center and the Chancellor's Sustainability Action Council, cited his "outstanding contributions as a leader in campus sustainability."
</p>
<p>
  Conference organizer Diane Behling noted that many of the sustainability efforts on campus--from water-saving plumbing to buses using biodiesel--fall under Vani's area of Business and Administrative Services.
</p>
<p>
  "When you look at all the current sustainable practices at UCSC, they really make a difference--and it's saving the campus a lot of money," said Behling, a senior facilities analyst in Capital Planning and Space Management.

        <title>Department of Energy grants fund work on new hydrogen fuel technologies</title>

</p>
<p>
  Nanotechnology may hold the key to developing a viable hydrogen economy, according to Jin Zhang, professor of chemistry and biochemistry.
</p>
<p>
  <a name="OLE_LINK2" id="OLE_LINK2"></a> Zhang will receive $535,000 in grants from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) for his part in two research projects aimed at developing new technologies for the production and storage of hydrogen fuel using nanostructured materials.
</p>
<p>
  Producing hydrogen from water using solar energy is the focus of one of the projects. Zhang is leading that effort and is also a coinvestigator on a second project to develop a method for highly efficient hydrogen storage. Both of the three-year projects rely on a novel approach to create nanostructured materials with special properties. Nanostructure refers to dimensions on the scale of billionths of a meter.
</p>
<p>
  "The goal is to produce clean energy," Zhang said. "The idea of using solar energy and water as a source of hydrogen is very attractive, and we believe nanostructured materials can be used to do this efficiently."
</p>
<p>
  The grants are among 70 hydrogen research projects funded through a $64 million DOE initiative aimed at making vehicles powered by hydrogen fuel cells available, practical, and affordable for American consumers by 2020. Zhang's collaborators on the hydrogen production project are Yiping Zhao of the University of Georgia at Athens and Wei Chen of Nomadics Inc. The hydrogen storage project is headed by Zhao and also involves Matthew McCluskey of Washington State University.
</p>
<p>
  Hydrogen offers an attractive alternative to fossil fuels because it is highly efficient and clean. But major technological hurdles must be overcome to make the use of hydrogen fuel practical.
</p>
<p>
  The first hurdle is how to produce the hydrogen. Water molecules can be split to form pure hydrogen and oxygen using electricity (a process called electrolysis). But the environmental advantages of hydrogen would be lost if the electricity used to generate it came from burning fossil fuels. Using solar energy to split water and generate hydrogen is not a new concept, but Zhang says his team's approach could lead to a device efficient enough for practical use.
</p>
<p>
  "We want to build a device that you can put in the sun, fill it with water, and get hydrogen without using any outside source of energy," Zhang said.
</p>
<p>
  The device will integrate two kinds of solar cells--a photovoltaic cell to produce electricity and a photoelectrochemical cell to produce hydrogen from the electrolysis of water. Both will use specially designed materials based on arrays of nanowires with uniform orientation. The main focus of the project will be on developing these nanostructured materials to optimize the efficiency of both the photovoltaic cell and the photoelectrochemical cell.
</p>
<p>
  The researchers will use a technique called glancing angle deposition (GLAD) to fabricate the nanowire arrays. Zhao is an expert on the use of this technique for making nanowires and nanorods. Zhang's lab will focus on characterizing the structure and properties of the materials Zhao makes and evaluating their suitability for achieving the highest possible efficiencies for the photovoltaic cell and the photoelectrochemical cell.
</p>
<p>
  The hydrogen storage project will also involve using the GLAD technique to fabricate nanostructured materials. One of the problems with hydrogen as a fuel is that it is a bulky gas that is not easily transported and stored. A promising solution is to store it in a solid form as a metal hydride compound. Metal hydride nanostructures could greatly improve the efficiency of this type of storage, Zhang said.
</p>
<p>
  "Nanostructures have a much larger surface area than bulk materials, so they could hold more hydrogen per unit weight," he said.
</p>
<p>
  The researchers plan to find the optimum conditions for fabricating metal hydride nanostructures to achieve highly efficient hydrogen storage.
</p>
<p>
  "The key to our success in each of these projects is the material. We need to understand the properties of these materials and then explore their applications in devices," Zhang said.

        <title>New findings show persistent El Nino-like conditions during past global warming</title>

  <br>
  June 27, 2005
</p>
<p>
  During the most recent period in Earth's past with a climate warmer than today, the tropical Pacific was in a stable state of El Nino-like conditions, according to a new study by UCSC researchers.
</p>
<p>
  Whether this represents a likely scenario for the future, given the current rise in global temperatures, is uncertain. Nevertheless, the study has important implications for scientists trying to understand the global climate system and how it might respond to global warming, the researchers said.
</p>
<p>
  El Nino is a temporary disruption of normal circulation patterns in the ocean and atmosphere in the tropical Pacific, with important consequences for weather around the globe. Because the system always returns to the normal circulation patterns after an El Nino event, many scientists have considered these patterns to be the only state in which the system can remain stable over long periods of time. The new study, published this week in the journal <i>Science,</i> shows that there is another stable state for the ocean-atmosphere system that is dramatically different from today's.
</p>
<p>
  "The stable configuration that we've gotten used to is not the only stable configuration for the tropical Pacific, and this suggests that the Earth's system for global heat transport functioned in a fundamentally different way the last time the climate was warmer than it is today," said the study's lead author, Michael Wara.
</p>
<p>
  Wara, who earned a Ph.D. in ocean sciences at UCSC, is now studying law and environmental policy at Stanford University. His coauthors are Christina Ravelo, associate professor of ocean sciences at UCSC, and Margaret Delaney, professor of ocean sciences at UCSC.
</p>
<p>
  The researchers based their findings on an analysis of hundreds of samples from sediment cores drilled from the ocean floor on opposite sides of the tropical Pacific Ocean. The sediment cores were obtained by the international Ocean Drilling Program from a site near Indonesia in the western Pacific and another site near the Galapagos Islands in the eastern Pacific.
</p>
<p>
  The sediments contain the microscopic shells of tiny sea creatures called foraminifera that lived in the surface waters of the ocean. The chemistry of these shells--in particular, the ratio of magnesium to calcium--is highly sensitive to the temperature of the water in which they formed. By analyzing the composition of the shells, the researchers were able to reconstruct a detailed record of sea-surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific during the Pliocene epoch, which lasted from about 5 million years ago to about 1.7 million years ago.
</p>
<p>
  Currently, the normal sea-surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific show a strong gradient from cool temperatures in the eastern Pacific off South America, where upwelling of cold deep water occurs, to much warmer temperatures in the west, where the trade winds pile up warm surface waters. During an El Nino, the trade winds slacken and warm water spreads eastward across the tropical Pacific, drastically weakening the temperature gradient. The UCSC researchers found that sea-surface temperatures during the Pliocene were much like those seen during an El Nino event.
</p>
<p>
  "It looks like a permanent El Nino," Ravelo said. "We know El Ninos have far-reaching global climate effects today, so that gives us an idea of what the global climate system may have been like during the Pliocene."
</p>
<p>
  The UCSC group's findings contradict a study published earlier this year in <i>Science,</i> which used the same methods but found cooler rather than warmer temperatures in the eastern Pacific. Ravelo said the difference is probably due to the much smaller number of samples analyzed in the earlier study. The UCSC group obtained more than 400 data points for the same time period covered by six data points in the earlier paper.
</p>
<p>
  "Maybe they were unlucky and got a couple of samples that don't represent that time period well," Ravelo said.
</p>
<p>
  Previous research by Ravelo and others has shown that conditions outside the tropics during the Pliocene were also consistent with a permanent El Nino-like state. The global consequences of El Nino events include dramatic changes in rainfall patterns, causing serious flooding in some areas while other regions experience droughts. Shifts in ocean temperatures also spread beyond the tropics, affecting fisheries along the California coast, for example.
</p>
<p>
  According to Ravelo, however, the El Nino-like conditions of the Pliocene should not be regarded as a direct analogy for the future effects of global warming. Rather, the Pliocene climate should serve as a target for global climate models to test their ability to reproduce the full range of possible climate states. Climate experts use computer-driven climate models to help them understand how the climate system works and how it is likely to respond to changes such as the increasing concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
</p>
<p>
  "The current climate models are very good at reproducing stable conditions in the tropics like we have today, but they should also be able to reproduce this very different tropical climate state that was stable in the past. If they can't, we know there is something missing," Ravelo said.
</p>
<p>
  The new study reinforces the notion that the coupled systems of oceanic and atmospheric circulation that drive the global climate are capable of dramatic shifts from one stable state to another.
</p>
<p>
  "Many aspects of the climate system that appear stable within a certain range of temperatures can shift dramatically when a particular threshold is passed," Wara said. "We can't say where that threshold is, but it is a concern as we continue this ongoing global experiment of adding greenhouse gases to the atmosphere."

</p>
<p>
  <br>
  By <a href="mailto:stephens@ucsc.edu">Tim Stephens</a><br>
</p>
<p>
  During the most recent period in Earth's past with a climate warmer than today, the tropical Pacific was in a stable state of El Nino-like conditions, according to a new study by UCSC researchers.
</p>
<p>
  Whether this represents a likely scenario for the future, given the current rise in global temperatures, is uncertain. Nevertheless, the study has important implications for scientists trying to understand the global climate system and how it might respond to global warming, the researchers said.
</p>
<p>
  El Nino is a temporary disruption of normal circulation patterns in the ocean and atmosphere in the tropical Pacific, with important consequences for weather around the globe. Because the system always returns to the normal circulation patterns after an El Nino event, many scientists have considered these patterns to be the only state in which the system can remain stable over long periods of time. The new study, published this week in the journal <i>Science,</i> shows that there is another stable state for the ocean-atmosphere system that is dramatically different from today's.
</p>
<p>
  "The stable configuration that we've gotten used to is not the only stable configuration for the tropical Pacific, and this suggests that the Earth's system for global heat transport functioned in a fundamentally different way the last time the climate was warmer than it is today," said the study's lead author, Michael Wara.
</p>
<p>
  Wara, who earned a Ph.D. in ocean sciences at UCSC, is now studying law and environmental policy at Stanford University. His coauthors are Christina Ravelo, associate professor of ocean sciences at UCSC, and Margaret Delaney, professor of ocean sciences at UCSC.
</p>
<p>
  The researchers based their findings on an analysis of hundreds of samples from sediment cores drilled from the ocean floor on opposite sides of the tropical Pacific Ocean. The sediment cores were obtained by the international Ocean Drilling Program from a site near Indonesia in the western Pacific and another site near the Galapagos Islands in the eastern Pacific.
</p>
<p>
  The sediments contain the microscopic shells of tiny sea creatures called foraminifera that lived in the surface waters of the ocean. The chemistry of these shells--in particular, the ratio of magnesium to calcium--is highly sensitive to the temperature of the water in which they formed. By analyzing the composition of the shells, the researchers were able to reconstruct a detailed record of sea-surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific during the Pliocene epoch, which lasted from about 5 million years ago to about 1.7 million years ago.
</p>
<p>
  Currently, the normal sea-surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific show a strong gradient from cool temperatures in the eastern Pacific off South America, where upwelling of cold deep water occurs, to much warmer temperatures in the west, where the trade winds pile up warm surface waters. During an El Nino, the trade winds slacken and warm water spreads eastward across the tropical Pacific, drastically weakening the temperature gradient. The UCSC researchers found that sea-surface temperatures during the Pliocene were much like those seen during an El Nino event.
</p>
<p>
  "It looks like a permanent El Nino," Ravelo said. "We know El Ninos have far-reaching global climate effects today, so that gives us an idea of what the global climate system may have been like during the Pliocene."
</p>
<p>
  The UCSC group's findings contradict a study published earlier this year in <i>Science,</i> which used the same methods but found cooler rather than warmer temperatures in the eastern Pacific. Ravelo said the difference is probably due to the much smaller number of samples analyzed in the earlier study. The UCSC group obtained more than 400 data points for the same time period covered by six data points in the earlier paper.
</p>
<p>
  "Maybe they were unlucky and got a couple of samples that don't represent that time period well," Ravelo said.
</p>
<p>

The global consequences of El Nino events include dramatic changes in rainfall patterns, causing serious flooding in some areas while other regions experience droughts. Shifts in ocean temperatures also spread beyond the tropics, affecting fisheries along the California coast, for example.

</p>
<p>
  UCSC has taken over the operation of NASA's Airborne Sensor Facility, a major program for observation and monitoring of Earth's environment based at NASA Ames Research Center in Moffett Field.
</p>
<p>
  <a name="OLE_LINK13" id="OLE_LINK13"></a>The transfer of management strengthens the links between NASA and UCSC and will enhance the campus's remote sensing capability and research, said Eli Silver, a professor of Earth sciences at UCSC who was named principal investigator of the facility in April.
</p>
<p>
  UCSC has a close collaborative relationship with NASA Ames, including management of the University Affiliated Research Center (UARC), a $330 million contract between UC and NASA for a broad range of mission-oriented research. The UARC will now oversee the activities and program of the Airborne Sensor Facility. Under the current agreement, NASA will provide funding to UCSC through the UARC at the rate of $3 million per year to cover operation costs, salaries for the current staff of 17, and stipends for one or two graduate students, Silver said.
</p>
<p>
  "The Airborne Sensor Facility brings an excellent new direction to the UCSC remote sensing program," said Silver, who also directs UCSC's Center for Remote Sensing.
</p>
<p>
  Researchers in the Center for Remote Sensing, part of the Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics at UCSC, use remote imaging tools to study Earth's surface, oceans, and atmosphere. Their investigations address many diverse topics, including coral reefs, glaciers, volcanoes, air pollution, ocean currents, and land-use planning. The center includes researchers in the Departments of Earth Sciences, Ocean Sciences, Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Electrical Engineering, and Computer Engineering.
</p>
<p>
  Placing the NASA Airborne Sensor Facility under UCSC's responsibility will give researchers in the Center for Remote Sensing easier access to data collected by the facility, Silver said. UCSC researchers will also have more direct input into the design of new sensors and aircraft, he said.
</p>
<p>
  The Airborne Sensor Facility develops and maintains a variety of aircraft and sensor systems for remote sensing research. The facility supports NASA programs as well as researchers at universities and government agencies, such as the U.S. Geological Survey and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Staff scientists at the facility build new sensing devices, maintain existing systems, and provide expertise in mission planning and data processing. Under UCSC management, the facility will continue to provide these services to researchers at NASA and other agencies and institutions.
</p>
<p>
  The sensors--including spectroradiometers and other digital imaging devices--are placed on a variety of NASA aircraft that fly at altitudes between a few hundred feet and 13 miles. These aircraft include both piloted airplanes and unmanned aerial vehicles. For NASA, the purpose of these flights is often to help interpret or calibrate the data collected by satellites that observe the Earth from space, orbiting at altitudes of around 500 miles.
</p>
<p>
  But airborne sensors are also useful in their own right, Silver said. Because they fly closer to the ground than satellites, they can gather more detailed data at higher resolutions. One pixel of information from an airborne sensor covers an area on a scale of inches to yards, rather than miles. In addition, researchers have more control over the area being surveyed, the resolution at which they gather data, and the dates and times of the surveys.
</p>
<p>
  Silver said he wants to develop remote sensing technology that will eventually help researchers detect life in extreme environments, including Mars. His team currently analyzes the spectral properties of fossil formations and living bacterial communities associated with coldwater seeps and volcanic geothermal areas on Earth. The sensors they have developed can record over a hundred separate wavelengths of light, which makes it possible to recognize the distinctive spectral signatures of a large variety of minerals and bacteria.
</p>
<p>
  With the help of the Airborne Sensor Facility, Silver and his colleagues can test their sensors' ability to pick up fossil or bacterial signatures from different altitudes. Silver also plans to use airborne sensors to compare the spectra of life-bearing and lifeless parts of the Atacama Desert in Chile, considered the most arid place on Earth and a model for the harsh conditions of the Martian surface.
</p>
<p>
  Access to the Airborne Sensor Facility's staff and its expertise in data analysis will be a great help to UCSC researchers, said Raphael Kudela, an associate professor of ocean sciences. Kudela's lab uses remote sensing of ocean waters to monitor blooms of algae along the California coast. Two years ago, he and his colleagues watched the evolution of a "red tide"--a bloom containing both benign and harmful toxin-producing algae--using NASA airborne sensors that could help distinguish between toxic and nontoxic microscopic algae.
</p>
<p>
  "The facility has two or three of the best sensors in the United States for our applications," Kudela said. But he added that interpreting the data these sensors collect requires specialized expertise that only the Airborne Sensor Facility can provide.
</p>
<p>
  Donald Potts, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology who specializes in reefs and coastal areas, said he looks forward to developing new kinds of sensors with the help of the Airborne Sensor Facility. His studies would benefit from sensors with high sensitivity at the blue end of the light spectrum, rather than the red and infrared wavelengths that most sensors currently emphasize, he said. In addition, technical advances in miniaturization could reduce operating costs.
</p>
<p>
  "Smaller sensors don't generate as much heat and don't need to be cooled in flight with liquid nitrogen. They can be placed on smaller aircraft that are cheaper to operate, including eventually unmanned planes," Potts said.
</p>
<p>
  NASA is using several unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that UCSC researchers could adapt to their scientific remote sensing needs with the help of the Airborne Sensor Facility staff, Silver said. The smallest UAVs are approximately the size of a large remote-controlled model airplane (100 pounds, 12-foot wingspan) and their itinerary can be controlled by radio or preprogrammed before a flight. Their operation does not require flight crews or landing strips and would be practical in developing countries with minimal infrastructure, Potts said. Some UAVs can fly for 24 hours at a time, which would make it possible to follow a complete tidal cycle, Kudela noted. Another advantage of UAVs is that they can be sent to explore very inhospitable environments.
</p>
<p>
  "In the future, we could use unmanned vehicles to study volcanoes," Silver said.

<p>
  Environmental justice researchers are at the forefront of efforts to evaluate the risks posed by air pollution, particularly the disproportionate risks faced by residents of low-income and minority neighborhoods.
</p>
<p>
  <a name="OLE_LINK8" id="OLE_LINK8"></a><a name="OLE_LINK9" id="OLE_LINK9">S</a>o it's good news that Manuel Pastor, professor of Latin American and Latino studies at UCSC and a leading researcher in the field of environmental justice, will head up a team that will share its expertise with the California Air Resources Board (CARB).
</p>
<p>
  With a grant for nearly $700,000, Pastor and colleagues James Sadd of Occidental College and Rachel Morello-Frosch of Brown University will work toward improving the way the state integrates environmental justice issues into its work on air quality. The board needs to expand its scope to incorporate the cumulative impacts of air pollution exposure and socioeconomic vulnerability into its regulatory decisionmaking, said Pastor.
</p>
<p>
  "Environmental justice has become a major policy issue in California, but there are gaps in the way the state conducts research," said Pastor. "We can help develop rigorous, trustworthy, and cost-efficient methodologies to identify and assist vulnerable communities."
</p>
<p>
  Based on evidence that environmental hazards are concentrated in poor and minority neighborhoods, environmental justice advocates seek redress for victims who suffer disproportionate exposure to hazardous substances such as toxic waste, air pollution, and industrial runoff. Pastor and his team have developed innovative measures of exposure and effect that they are eager to share. An interagency group is currently developing environmental justice implementation guidelines for the California Environmental Protection Agency.
</p>
<p>
  "This is the time to work at the state level," added Pastor, codirector of UCSC's Center for Justice, Tolerance, and Community.
</p>
<p>
  Specifically, the CARB grant will enable Pastor's team to fill some of the data-gathering and analytical gaps faced by state regulators. Pastor and his colleagues will conduct statewide and regional studies to identify the key factors that explain existing patterns of racial and ethnic disparities in lifetime cancer and other health risks associated with outdoor air toxics exposure.
</p>
<p>
  Those results will help Pastor develop measures of cumulative impact and community vulnerability at the neighborhood level, with an eye toward guiding policy regarding protection, community participation, and educational outreach about air pollution. The project will also include a community-based "validation study" in the Oakland area to identify sources of emissions that may have gone undetected by CARB.
</p>
<p>
  Community participation is essential, according to Pastor, who said it builds trust in the process and the final outcome. He also noted that tools developed by outside researchers to assess environmental equity will be useful to state agencies as they respond to community concerns.
</p>

<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  <br>
  By <a href="mailto:jmcnulty@ucsc.edu">Jennifer McNulty</a><br>
</p>
<p>
  Psychology professor Aida Hurtado tells a family story when describing her goals as the newly elected leader of the National Association for Chicana and Chicano Studies (NACCS).
</p>
<p>
  Every spring, Hurtado says, her 73-year-old mother leaves her home in McAllen, Texas, and heads to the border city of Reynosa, Mexico, to get her annual "tune-up."
</p>
<p>
  The ritual includes a new wardrobe, "the works" in the local beauty salon, and maybe even a new hair color.
</p>
<p>
  "My mother says, <i>'Renovarse o morir,'</i> which means reinvent yourself or die," said Hurtado.
</p>
<p>
  That spirit underlies Hurtado's hopes for the nation's largest ethnic studies organization focused on Latino issues. As the incoming chair of NACCS, Hurtado wants to increase the association's visibility and its contributions to public-policy debates. Established in 1972, the association was formed to support scholars and students working in Chicano/Latino studies.
</p>
<p>
  "Our group has always had a commitment to activist scholarship--to putting the knowledge produced in the academy to use in the community," said Hurtado. "As researchers, we don't divorce ourselves from social problems."
</p>
<p>
  Over more than three decades, NACCS scholars have built up an impressive body of research in Chicano and Latino studies on topics such as immigration, education, poverty, gang violence, women, and the media, said Hurtado. NACCS members are well-situated to draft position papers and share their findings with decision makers and the public, she said.<br>
  <br>
  "We know a lot about the Chicano-Latino population in the United States, and we have the expertise to really speak on the issues," said Hurtado. "We need to continue to mentor the next generation of scholars, because that's our lifeline, but we also need to draw upon our expertise to move the organization forward."
</p>
<p>
  Hurtado's own research interests include equity issues in education. Her most recent books are <i>Chicana/o Identity in Changing U.S. society ?Quien soy? ?Quienes somos?</i>, coauthored with Patricia Gurin, and <i>Voicing Chicana Feminisms: Young Chicanas Speak Out on Sexuality and Feminism</i>, which received an honorable mention in 2003 from the Gustavus Myers Center for the Study of Bigotry and Human Rights in North America.
</p>
<p>
  California, with its large college and university system, leads the nation in Chicano and Latino studies, and UCSC leads the state, said Hurtado. "We have an amazing reputation nationally for Chicano/Latino research," she said. "At UCSC, we have 20 Chicana/Latinas on the faculty, including eight full professors--that's the second-largest number of Latinas in the UC system behind UCLA. I'm very proud to be part of this intellectual community." Hurtado and her UCSC colleagues Gabriela Arredondo, Norma Klahn, Olga Najera-Ramirez, and Patricia Zavella collaborated on the 2003 book, <i>Chicana Feminisms: A Critical Reader.</i>
</p>
<p>
  Systemwide, it's a different story. Of 8,444 professors in the UC system, only 416 are Chicano/Latino, and about one-third overall are women, according to Hurtado. Nationally, only about 5 percent of 30,000 doctorates awarded in 2003 went to Latinos, she added.
</p>
<p>
  "We are a very small presence in the academy nationally, which is why we have to figure out how to open the academic pipeline and get more graduates at every level," said Hurtado. "If you asked what the top three policy issues facing Latinos in this country are, it would be education, education, education."
</p>
<p>
  With more than 40 million Latinos living in the United States, most of Mexican descent, it is time for NACCS members to share the expertise they've developed about this growing population, said Hurtado. "The changing demographics of the country put us in a very different leadership position nationally," said Hurtado, who joined NACCS in 1983.
</p>
<p>
  NACCS has always had an explicitly international focus, and its scholarly makeup sets it apart from advocacy organizations like the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund and the League of United Latin American Citizens.
</p>
<p>
  "People often think of ethnic organizations as being separatist or ethnocentric, but we are very much concerned about everybody's rights and social issues," she explained. "We're in solidarity with African American struggles. We're not at odds with each other. A lot of what we have learned about social justice came from what we learned from the black civil rights struggle."
</p>
<p>
  Hurtado sees an opportunity for NACCS to influence the terms of public debate by having association experts draft position papers for distribution to legislators, think tanks, journalists, and others.
</p>
<p>
  During her two-year tenure as chair, Hurtado hopes to create an infrastructure that will make outreach an ongoing activity of the organization. "I see myself as just the initiator," she said.

<p>
  The University Library's Regional History Project has announced the publication of <i>The Cowell Press and Its Legacy: 1973-2004.</i>
</p>
<p>
  This oral history, conducted and edited by book-arts scholar and UCSC alumnus Gregory Graalfs, focuses on the history and impact of the legendary Cowell College press at UCSC.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The Cowell Press helped shape the careers and creative lives of many UCSC students throughout its 30-year history.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "Far more than a letterpress print shop where students could make pretty books, the press was a laboratory to explore the history of tangible words--whether printed, cut in stone, or calligraphed," noted Irene Reti, director of the Regional History Project.
</p>
<p>
  "In addition, the influence of 20th-century literature and visual art on typography was considered, as well as how typography was concerned with design principles that can be applied to film, architecture, and information design."<br>
</p>
<p>
  The new publication features interviews with fine printers Jack Stauffacher and George Kane, who taught at the press, as well as former students Aaron Johnson, Peggy Gotthold, Felicia Rice, and Tom Killion.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "The Cowell Press is a legacy of the unique and experimental quality of the UC Santa Cruz campus--characterized by its early use of evaluations rather than grades, the emphasis on close teacher and student contact, and the Farm & Garden project," Reti observed. "The study of bookmaking--of how thoughts and knowledge are communicated through the vital medium of a book--fit well within the parameters of such a teaching structure and the concept of the university envisioned by founders Clark Kerr and Dean McHenry."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Selected works from the Cowell Press will be on exhibit at Special Collections in UCSC's McHenry Library this summer. A reception for the oral history publication will also be held at Special Collections on Friday, July 15, from 3:30 to 5 p.m. Admission is free and open to the public. For more information about the reception or exhibit, call (831) 459-2547.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Copies of the oral history may be ordered from the Regional History Project by contacting Reti at (831) 459-2847 or <a href="mailto:ihreti@ucsc.edu%20">ihreti@ucsc.edu.</a> The publication is also available online at <a href="http://library.ucsc.edu/reg-hist/index.html">library.ucsc.edu/reg-hist/index.html</a> and is available for viewing at Special Collections.<br>

  "Far more than a letterpress print shop where students could make pretty books, the press was a laboratory to explore the history of tangible words--whether printed, cut in stone, or calligraphed," noted Irene Reti, director of the Regional History Project.
</p>
<p>
  "In addition, the influence of 20th-century literature and visual art on typography was considered, as well as how typography was concerned with design principles that can be applied to film, architecture, and information design."<br>
</p>
<p>
  The new publication features interviews with fine printers Jack Stauffacher and George Kane, who taught at the press, as well as former students Aaron Johnson, Peggy Gotthold, Felicia Rice, and Tom Killion.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "The Cowell Press is a legacy of the unique and experimental quality of the UC Santa Cruz campus--characterized by its early use of evaluations rather than grades, the emphasis on close teacher and student contact, and the Farm & Garden project," Reti observed. "The study of bookmaking--of how thoughts and knowledge are communicated through the vital medium of a book--fit well within the parameters of such a teaching structure and the concept of the university envisioned by founders Clark Kerr and Dean McHenry."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Selected works from the Cowell Press will be on exhibit at Special Collections in UCSC's McHenry Library this summer. A reception for the oral history publication will also be held at Special Collections on Friday, July 15, from 3:30 to 5 p.m. Admission is free and open to the public. For more information about the reception or exhibit, call (831) 459-2547.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Copies of the oral history may be ordered from the Regional History Project by contacting Reti at (831) 459-2847 or <a href="mailto:ihreti@ucsc.edu%20">ihreti@ucsc.edu.</a> The publication is also available online at <a href="http://library.ucsc.edu/reg-hist/index.html">library.ucsc.edu/reg-hist/index.html</a> and is available for viewing at Special Collections.<br>

<p>
  <br>
  By <a href="mailto:stephens@ucsc.edu">Tim Stephens</a><br>
</p>
<p>
  SlugGo, a computer program designed at UCSC to play the ancient Chinese game of go, entered its first computer go tournament this month and came out on top.
</p>
<p>
  "We played against one of the top commercial programs, so we were pleased--we would not have been surprised to lose," said Charles McDowell, professor of computer science.
</p>
<p>
  "We barely squeaked out a win. I was very surprised when I saw the final score," added David Doshay, a UCSC alumnus who is working with McDowell on the project. "We have been having a great deal of fun and success with the go playing program."
</p>
<p>
  Doshay's Hierarchical Systems Research Foundation provided the powerful cluster of Apple Xserve G5 computers used to run SlugGo (see <a href="http://currents.ucsc.edu/04-05/07-26/cluster.html">earlier story</a>).
</p>
<p>
  McDowell, Doshay, and several students have been developing SlugGo as part of a project to design a software infrastructure that makes it easier to program computer clusters for parallel processing. Parallel processing speeds up the execution of a computer program by dividing it up and running multiple pieces of it simultaneously on separate computer processors.
</p>
<p>
  "Parallel processing used to be the domain of specialists, but it is becoming more widespread, so we're trying to make it easier for the growing number of software developers who need to program parallel computers," McDowell said.
</p>
<p>
  The computer go tournament was organized by the <a href="http://kgs.kiseido.com">Kiseido Go Server</a> (http://kgs.kiseido.com), a web site where go enthusiasts can compete against players from around the world. Kiseido organizes tournaments for people as well as computers. In May, SlugGo was one of two computer programs invited to compete in a human tournament. The UCSC program only won one game, but fared better than the other computer program in the tournament, which didn't win any games.
</p>
<p>
  "I look at being invited to enter a human tournament at all as quite a milestone in the history of computer go," said Doshay, who traveled to Los Angeles with a cluster of computers to compete in the tournament.
</p>
<p>
  Go poses much greater challenges for computers than chess. Currently, the best computer go programs only play at the level of a moderately good amateur, McDowell said.
</p>
<p>
  SlugGo is built largely on the foundation of an open-source software program called Gnu Go. Students who have worked on the project most recently include undergraduate Brian Chavez, who just earned his B.S. in computer science, and graduate student Kai Wang, who just earned her M.S. in computer science.
</p>
<p>
  "There are a number of computer science challenges that make the go program a useful exercise for us," McDowell said. "Now that we've got it to where it's playing well, it's actually fairly addictive to try to keep making it better."

        <title>Conference season gets under way on campus</title>

</p>
<p>
  Not long after thousands of UCSC students head home for the summer, a new batch of residents begins arriving.
</p>
<p>
  <a name="OLE_LINK13" id="OLE_LINK13"></a>Summer is conference season, and the campus is rolling out the welcome mat for 11,000 visitors this summer. The visitors will attend 70 different conferences or camps, learning about everything from Charles Dickens to cheerleading.
</p>
<p>
  Some of the groups have been making UCSC their summer home for decades, but 12 groups will be on campus for the first time, said Martha Keeler, Colleges and University Housing Services assistant director for conference services.
</p>
<p>
  "We have an 85 percent return rate," Keeler noted. "UC Santa Cruz is a very popular destination. Everybody loves to come to such a beautiful campus." All the activity is good news for UCSC's bottom line, bringing in an estimated $4 million gross income to campus.
</p>
<p>
  The visitors come in all ages and from around the world. The University Extension Japanese English Language Program, for instance, has been bringing middle school and high schoolers school age youth to campus for 20 years to experience American culture and learn English.
</p>
<p>
  Cheerleaders make up a large part of the younger summer visitors, Keeler said, adding that nearly 500 cheerleaders attend some of the camps. Participants in other sports--from soccer to water polo--are also well represented.
</p>
<p>
  Music is another major draw, with participants in all ages. Soundwall Music Camp, a rock music camp for youth, will be on campus the same time as the Mandolin Symposium, an adult program featuring renowned artists teaching technique, history and theory of mandolin music in bluegrass, swing, jazz, and ethnic formats.
</p>
<p>
  Academic conferences are also a mainstay. One of the best known is <a href="http://humwww.ucsc.edu/dickens/universe/universe.html">the Dickens Universe,</a> celebrating its 25th anniversary at UCSC this summer. New this summer is the <a href="http://astro.ucsc.edu/%7Enng/">Nearly Normal Galaxies conference,</a> hosted by UCSC's Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics.
</p>
<p>

<p>
  Thee Friends of Long Marine Lab will hold its 20th annual "Whale of an Auction," the group's popular annual fundraiser, on Friday, June 17. The event will take place in the Porter College Dining Hall, starting at 6 p.m.
</p>
<p>
  Over the past 20 years, the auction has grown from humble beginnings into a lavish affair featuring a catered buffet, fine wines, champagne, and lots of excitement. The event includes both live and silent auctions. Tickets for the evening are $75 at the door. For additional information, call (831) 459-3800.
</p>
<p>
  Highlights of the items up for bid at this year's auction include exclusive vacation retreats in Paris, St. Barts, Kauai, La Quinta, Puerto Vallarta, Napa, San Francisco, and other exciting locales; a private history and geology tour of Point Lobos with UCSC geologist Gary Griggs and historian Sandy Lydon; field trips, research cruises, private presentations, and behind-the-scenes tours with renowned Long Marine Lab scientists; specialty wines and private wine-tasting tours; private art, baking, and cooking classes; a bumper-car party for 50 at the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk; a lobster and clambake for 20 on the beach catered by the Crow's Nest Restaurant; artwork, jewelry, and exquisite blown glass; sports equipment and tickets to sporting events; and much, much more.
</p>
<p>
  All education programs and daily operations of the lab's <a href="http://seymourcenter.ucsc.edu/">Seymour Marine Discovery Center</a> depend on community support. Contributions to the Whale of an Auction help bring marine science alive for the community. Last year's event was a great success, with more than 400 bidders who helped raise more than $80,000 in crucial funds for the Seymour Center.

        <title>UCSC scientists contribute to analysis of chimp genome</title>

<p>
  New insights into the genetic differences between humans and chimpanzees, our closest relatives on the tree of life, are emerging from a comparative analysis of the genomes of the two species.
</p>
<p>
  UCSC researchers are part of an international team of scientists that has just published the first results from this analysis in the September 1 issue of the journal <i>Nature.</i>
</p>
<p>
  "The chimp genome sequence offers an unprecedented opportunity to understand primate evolution and to identify the genetic changes that gave rise to the modern human species. It's our first chance to see which parts of our genome are distinctly human," said Katherine Pollard, a postdoctoral researcher in UCSC's Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering (CBSE) and a coauthor of one of four papers on the chimpanzee genome published in this issue of <i>Nature</i>.
</p>
<p>
  The paper presents a catalog of the genetic differences that have accumulated since the lineages that led to modern humans and chimpanzees diverged from a common ancester about 6 million years ago. The researchers have identified several regions of the human genome that bear the hallmarks of strong natural selection, whereas the corresponding chimpanzee sequences do not. These sequences may hold the most promise for determining human-specific traits such as language.
</p>
<p>
  The analysis was carried out by the Chimpanzee Sequencing and Analysis Consortium, led by Robert Waterston of the University of Washington School of Medicine and Eric Lander of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard. As with other major genome sequencing and analysis efforts, UCSC researchers provided bioinformatics expertise and developed a web-based browser and other valuable tools used to analyze the data. The <a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu">UCSC Genome Browser</a> is a highly popular web-based portal for the scientific exploration of genome sequences and related data.
</p>
<p>
  Pollard, who works with CBSE director David Haussler, has been involved in the chimp project since November 2003, when she began taking part in weekly conference calls with other members of the consortium. CBSE research scientist James Kent and software developer Kate Rosenbloom also contributed to the project and are coauthors on the paper.
</p>
<p>
  "We built a browser for the chimp genome and also added a couple of chimp tracks to the human genome browser to help with the comparative analysis," Kent said.
</p>
<p>
  Pollard said the <i>Nature</i> paper provides an overview of the consortium's initial findings and will be followed by additional papers focusing on specific questions. Pollard, for example, has been working to identify the regions of the human genome that have been evolving most rapidly.
</p>
<p>
  "That is the kind of question that could not be answered without looking at the genome of our closest relative," she said.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  The student callers in the Telephone Outreach Program hit a new record at the end of the fiscal year 2005 campaign, raising $1,177,114. The funds will benefit all areas of campus, including academic divisions, McHenry Library, departments and departmental programs, scholarships and fellowships, resource centers, colleges, and undergraduate research and internships.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The Telephone Outreach Program is sponsored by the Annual Fund office and employs a student staff of 30. The students contact more than 17,000 alumni, parents, and friends of the university for private support. The TOP effort is led by Zack Weigert-Derr, assistant director of the Annual Fund, and program assistants Jennifer Dunn and Stephanie Wong.
</p>
<p>
  The campuswide <a href="http://giving.ucsc.edu/">Cornerstone Campaign</a> helped propel the 2005 TOP campaign into a record year with its focus on scholarships and fellowships. Many donors recognize the importance of making a university education accessible and were ready to help compensate for ever-decreasing state funding.<br>

<p>
  The Friends of Long Marine Lab will hold its 20th annual "Whale of an Auction," the group's popular annual fundraiser, on Friday, June 17. The event will take place in the Porter College Dining Hall, starting at 6 p.m.
</p>
<p>
  Over the past 20 years, the auction has grown from humble beginnings into a lavish affair featuring a catered buffet, fine wines, champagne, and lots of excitement. The event includes both live and silent auctions. Tickets for the evening are $75 at the door. For additional information, call (831) 459-3800.
</p>
<p>
  Highlights of the items up for bid at this year's auction include exclusive vacation retreats in Paris, St. Barts, Kauai, La Quinta, Puerto Vallarta, Napa, San Francisco, and other exciting locales; a private history and geology tour of Point Lobos with UCSC geologist Gary Griggs and historian Sandy Lydon; field trips, research cruises, private presentations, and behind-the-scenes tours with renowned Long Marine Lab scientists; specialty wines and private wine-tasting tours; private art, baking, and cooking classes; a bumper-car party for 50 at the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk; a lobster and clambake for 20 on the beach catered by the Crow's Nest Restaurant; artwork, jewelry, and exquisite blown glass; sports equipment and tickets to sporting events; and much, much more.
</p>
<p>
  All education programs and daily operations of the lab's <a href="http://seymourcenter.ucsc.edu/">Seymour Marine Discovery Center</a> depend on community support. Contributions to the Whale of an Auction help bring marine science alive for the community. Last year's event was a great success, with more than 400 bidders who helped raise more than $80,000 in crucial funds for the Seymour Center.
</p>
<p>
  The Seymour Center at Long Marine Lab is dedicated to educating people about the role scientific research plays in the understanding and conservation of the world's oceans. Research conducted by UCSC scientists in Monterey Bay and around the world is featured in the center's exhibits, along with galleries of aquaria, seawater tables, an 87-foot blue whale skeleton, and much more. Located at the end of Delaware Ave. in Santa Cruz, the Seymour Center is open to the public every day except Mondays. Long Marine Lab is a research facility of the Institute of Marine Sciences at UCSC.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  Stepped-up enforcement resulted in 134 seat-belt violation citations being written May 16-June 5, campus police reported.
</p>
<p>
  UCSC's officers joined local and state police in the nationwide "Click it or Ticket" campaign administered by the National Highway Traffic Safety campaign.
</p>
<p>
  Surveys were conducted before and after the enhanced enforcement to gauge the impact of the effort. The first survey, conducted on May 11, showed a 92 percent seat belt usage rate, police said. After the campaign, a June 8 survey showed seat belt usage by drivers had risen to 98 percent, police said.
</p>
<p>
  Two UCSC police officers, Tony Contreras and Steve Garcia, were nominated for California Office of Traffic Safety awards for their outstanding efforts during the campaign.

        <title>Biotech training grant funds interdisciplinary research</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 27 Jun 2005 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>6010</wp:post_id>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  Electrical engineering graduate student Dongliang Yin and Professor Holger Schmidt were awarded a major training grant for optical studies of biological molecules. Their grant is one of 11 new training grants awarded by the UC Systemwide Biotechnology Research and Education Program to support innovative research at the cutting edge of biotechnology.
</p>
<p>
  The $50,000-per-year Graduate Research and Education in Adaptive bioTechnology (GREAT) training grants are among the highest individual awards given for graduate education and training anywhere in the nation. They will fund cross-disciplinary biotechnology-related research into such areas as stem cells, protein mapping, and cell-membrane modeling.
</p>
<p>
  "Rapid advancements in technology are catalyzed by providing an environment to nurture diverse fields of study," said Martina Newell McGloughlin, director of the UC systemwide biotechnology program, headquartered at UC Davis. "Examples are found in the areas of nanotechnology and modeling of biological materials."
</p>
<p>
  Grant recipients were selected according to their demonstrated ability to understand and solve problems that cross varied disciplines.
</p>
<p>
  The GREAT program, developed two years ago, supports the training of the brightest young UC graduate students in theoretical and experimental research at the interface between the life sciences and the physical, chemical, engineering, mathematical, and computational sciences.
</p>
<p>
  This year's awards bring the total number of GREAT training grants to 22. Of the 10 UC campuses, all but the newly opened Merced campus have received one or more of these grants.
</p>
<p>
  The GREAT program is intended to foster and support meritorious research in biotechnology; enhance training for students and postdoctoral fellows; and inform government, industry, and the public about developments in biotechnology and their impact in the public arena.
</p>
<p>
  "Our program is committed to support novel research and training, and to educating students and the public about the exciting promise and potential of biotechnology," McGloughlin said. "We promote open and factual discussions on scientific research as it applies to biotechnology and make ourselves available to the public, other institutions, and government officials to answer questions."

<p>
  The Friends of Long Marine Lab will hold its 20th annual "Whale of an Auction," the group's popular annual fundraiser, on Friday, June 17. The event will take place in the Porter College Dining Hall, starting at 6 p.m.
</p>
<p>
  Over the past 20 years, the auction has grown from humble beginnings into a lavish affair featuring a catered buffet, fine wines, champagne, and lots of excitement. The event includes both live and silent auctions. Tickets for the evening are $75 at the door. For additional information, call (831) 459-3800.
</p>
<p>
  Highlights of the items up for bid at this year's auction include exclusive vacation retreats in Paris, St. Barts, Kauai, La Quinta, Puerto Vallarta, Napa, San Francisco, and other exciting locales; a private history and geology tour of Point Lobos with UCSC geologist Gary Griggs and historian Sandy Lydon; field trips, research cruises, private presentations, and behind-the-scenes tours with renowned Long Marine Lab scientists; specialty wines and private wine-tasting tours; private art, baking, and cooking classes; a bumper-car party for 50 at the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk; a lobster and clambake for 20 on the beach catered by the Crow's Nest Restaurant; artwork, jewelry, and exquisite blown glass; sports equipment and tickets to sporting events; and much, much more.
</p>
<p>
  All education programs and daily operations of the lab's <a href="http://seymourcenter.ucsc.edu/">Seymour Marine Discovery Center</a> depend on community support. Contributions to the Whale of an Auction help bring marine science alive for the community. Last year's event was a great success, with more than 400 bidders who helped raise more than $80,000 in crucial funds for the Seymour Center.
</p>
<p>
  The Seymour Center at Long Marine Lab is dedicated to educating people about the role scientific research plays in the understanding and conservation of the world's oceans. Research conducted by UCSC scientists in Monterey Bay and around the world is featured in the center's exhibits, along with galleries of aquaria, seawater tables, an 87-foot blue whale skeleton, and much more. Located at the end of Delaware Ave. in Santa Cruz, the Seymour Center is open to the public every day except Mondays. Long Marine Lab is a research facility of the Institute of Marine Sciences at UCSC.

<p>
  Ingrid Parker, associate professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, has been awarded a Fulbright Scholar grant to teach and do research at the University of Panama during the 2005-06 academic year.
</p>
<p>
  The grant will support Parker's work on a project titled "Applied plant ecology in Panama: Building intellectual capital and assessing the impact of 'genetic pollution' in a tropical forest tree."
</p>
<p>
  Parker is one of approximately 800 U.S. faculty and professionals who will travel abroad to some 140 countries for the 2005-06 academic year through the Fulbright Scholar Program. Recipients of Fulbright Scholar awards are selected on the basis of academic or professional achievement and because they have demonstrated extraordinary leadership potential in their fields.
</p>
<p>
  The Fulbright Program is sponsored by the U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs. Established in 1946 under legislation introduced by the late Senator J. William Fulbright of Arkansas, the program aims to build mutual understanding between the people of the United States and other countries.

        <title>Howard Hughes Medical Institute extends appointment of biologist Yishi Jin</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_6001" align="alignright" width="140"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/06/jin_yishi.140.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-6001" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/06/jin_yishi.140.jpg" alt="Yishi Jin UCSC Photo Services" width="140" height="176" /></a>Yishi Jin UCSC Photo Services[/caption]
<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  The Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) has extended the appointment of biologist Yishi Jin as an HHMI investigator. Jin, a professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology, was appointed to an initial five-year term as a HHMI investigator in 2000. After a successful review earlier this year, her appointment will continue through August 2010.
</p>
<p>
  Jin studies the development of the nervous system using the roundworm <i>C. elegans</i> as a model organism. Her lab was involved in the recent development of a new technique for studying nerve regeneration (see <a href="http://currents.ucsc.edu/04-05/01-03/regeneration.asp">Currents story</a>). Other projects in her lab include research on the genes that control development of motor neurons.
</p>
<p>
  There are approximately 300 HHMI investigators at more than 60 universities, research institutes, and medical schools around the country. By appointing scientists as investigators, rather than awarding research grants, the HHMI is guided by the principle of "people, not projects." The investigators are HHMI employees who also maintain their faculty positions at their host institutions. In addition to Jin, UCSC's David Haussler, a professor of biomolecular engineering, is also a HHMI investigator.
</p>
<p>
  The Howard Hughes Medical Institute is a nonprofit medical research organization dedicated to discovering and disseminating new knowledge in the basic life sciences.<br>

<p>
  UCSC alumnus Cary Fukunaga has been named a silver medal winner in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences' 32nd annual Student Academy Awards competition. He was honored for his film <i>Victoria Para Chino</i>, a 14-minute narrative film based on the true story of the worst single case of illegal immigrant death in United States history.
</p>
<p>
  Fukunaga graduated with a bachelor's degree in history from UCSC in 1999 prior to attending New York University, where he made the award-winning film.
</p>
<p>
  He is one of 12 student winners from 11 different colleges and universities who participated in a week of industry-related activities and social events, culminating with a June 12 awards presentation ceremony at the academy's Samuel Goldwyn Theater. Cinematographers Caleb Deschanel, a five-time Oscar nominee (<i>The Passion of the Christ, The Patriot, Fly Away Home, The Natural, The Right Stuff</i>), and Karl Walter Lindenlaub (whose credits include <i>The Princess Diaries, The Haunting, Independence Day</i>, and <i>Stargate</i>) served as presenters at the event where Fukunaga received a trophy and $3,000.
</p>
<p>
  The Student Academy Awards were established by the academy in 1972 to support and encourage excellence in filmmaking at the college level.<br>

<p>
  UCSC has taken over the operation of NASA's Airborne Sensor Facility, a major program for observation and monitoring of Earth's environment based at NASA Ames Research Center in Moffett Field.
</p>
<p>
  The transfer of management strengthens the links between NASA and UCSC and will enhance the campus's remote sensing capability and research, said Eli Silver, a professor of Earth sciences at UCSC who was named principal investigator of the facility in April.
</p>
<p>
  UCSC has a close collaborative relationship with NASA Ames, including management of the University Affiliated Research Center (UARC), a $330 million contract between UC and NASA for a broad range of mission-oriented research. The UARC will now oversee the activities and program of the Airborne Sensor Facility. Under the current agreement, NASA will provide funding to UCSC through the UARC at the rate of $3 million per year to cover operation costs, salaries for the current staff of 17, and stipends for one or two graduate students, Silver said.
</p>
<p>
  "The Airborne Sensor Facility brings an excellent new direction to the UCSC remote sensing program," said Silver, who also directs UCSC's Center for Remote Sensing.
</p>
<p>
  Researchers in the Center for Remote Sensing, part of the Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics at UCSC, use remote imaging tools to study Earth's surface, oceans, and atmosphere. Their investigations address many diverse topics, including coral reefs, glaciers, volcanoes, air pollution, ocean currents, and land-use planning. The center includes researchers in the Departments of Earth Sciences, Ocean Sciences, Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, Electrical Engineering, and Computer Engineering.
</p>
<p>
  Placing the NASA Airborne Sensor Facility under UCSC's responsibility will give researchers in the Center for Remote Sensing easier access to data collected by the facility, Silver said. UCSC researchers will also have more direct input into the design of new sensors and aircraft, he said.
</p>
<p>
  The Airborne Sensor Facility develops and maintains a variety of aircraft and sensor systems for remote sensing research. The facility supports NASA programs as well as researchers at universities and government agencies, such as the U.S. Geological Survey and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Staff scientists at the facility build new sensing devices, maintain existing systems, and provide expertise in mission planning and data processing. Under UCSC management, the facility will continue to provide these services to researchers at NASA and other agencies and institutions.
</p>
<p>
  The sensors--including spectroradiometers and other digital imaging devices--are placed on a variety of NASA aircraft that fly at altitudes between a few hundred feet and 13 miles. These aircraft include both piloted airplanes and unmanned aerial vehicles. For NASA, the purpose of these flights is often to help interpret or calibrate the data collected by satellites that observe the Earth from space, orbiting at altitudes of around 500 miles.
</p>
<p>
  But airborne sensors are also useful in their own right, Silver said. Because they fly closer to the ground than satellites, they can gather more detailed data at higher resolutions. One pixel of information from an airborne sensor covers an area on a scale of inches to yards, rather than miles. In addition, researchers have more control over the area being surveyed, the resolution at which they gather data, and the dates and times of the surveys.
</p>
<p>
  Silver said he wants to develop remote sensing technology that will eventually help researchers detect life in extreme environments, including Mars. His team currently analyzes the spectral properties of fossil formations and living bacterial communities associated with coldwater seeps and volcanic geothermal areas on Earth. The sensors they have developed can record over a hundred separate wavelengths of light, which makes it possible to recognize the distinctive spectral signatures of a large variety of minerals and bacteria.
</p>
<p>
  With the help of the Airborne Sensor Facility, Silver and his colleagues can test their sensors' ability to pick up fossil or bacterial signatures from different altitudes. Silver also plans to use airborne sensors to compare the spectra of life-bearing and lifeless parts of the Atacama Desert in Chile, considered the most arid place on Earth and a model for the harsh conditions of the Martian surface.
</p>
<p>
  Access to the Airborne Sensor Facility's staff and its expertise in data analysis will be a great help to UCSC researchers, said Raphael Kudela, an assistant professor of ocean sciences. Kudela's lab uses remote sensing of ocean waters to monitor blooms of algae along the California coast. Two years ago, he and his colleagues watched the evolution of a "red tide"--a bloom containing both benign and harmful toxin-producing algae--using NASA airborne sensors that could help distinguish between toxic and non-toxic microscopic algae.
</p>
<p>
  "The facility has two or three of the best sensors in the United States for our applications," Kudela said. But he added that interpreting the data these sensors collect requires specialized expertise that only the Airborne Sensor Facility can provide.
</p>
<p>
  Donald Potts, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology who specializes in reefs and coastal areas, said he looks forward to developing new kinds of sensors with the help of the Airborne Sensor Facility. His studies would benefit from sensors with high sensitivity at the blue end of the light spectrum, rather than the red and infrared wavelengths that most sensors currently emphasize, he said. In addition, technical advances in miniaturization could reduce operating costs.
</p>
<p>
  "Smaller sensors don't generate as much heat and don't need to be cooled in flight with liquid nitrogen. They can be placed on smaller aircraft that are cheaper to operate, including eventually unmanned planes," Potts said.
</p>
<p>
  NASA is using several unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that UCSC researchers could adapt to their scientific remote sensing needs with the help of the Airborne Sensor Facility staff, Silver said. The smallest UAVs are approximately the size of a large remote-controlled model airplane (100 pounds, 12-foot wingspan) and their itinerary can be controlled by radio or preprogrammed before a flight. Their operation does not require flight crews or landing strips and would be practical in developing countries with minimal infrastructure, Potts said.Some UAVs can fly for 24 hours at a time, which would make it possible to follow a complete tidal cycle, Kudela noted. Another advantage of UAVs is that they can be sent to explore very inhospitable environments.
</p>
<p>
  "In the future, we could use unmanned vehicles to study volcanoes," Silver said.

<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  A team of astronomers has reached a major milestone in the search for Earthlike planets with the discovery of the smallest planet ever detected beyond our solar system. About seven and a half times as massive as Earth, with less than twice the radius, it may be the first rocky planet ever found orbiting a normal star not much different from our Sun.
</p>
<p>
  All of the nearly 150 other extrasolar planets discovered to date around normal stars have been larger than Uranus, an ice giant about 15 times the mass of the Earth.
</p>
<p>
  "We keep pushing the limits of what we can detect, and we're getting closer and closer to finding Earths," said team member Steven Vogt, a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC.
</p>
<p>
  The new planet orbits the star Gliese 876, just 15 light-years away and located in the constellation Aquarius. This star also harbors two larger, Jupiter-size planets.
</p>
<p>
  The smaller planet whips around the star in a mere two days, and is so close to the star's surface that its temperature probably tops 200 to 400 degrees Celsius (400 to 750 degrees Fahrenheit)--ovenlike temperatures far too hot for life as we know it.
</p>
<p>
  Nevertheless, the ability to detect the tiny wobble that the planet induces in the star gives astronomers confidence that they will be able to detect even smaller rocky planets in orbits more hospitable to life. Though the team has no proof that this new planet is rocky, its low mass precludes it from retaining gas, like Jupiter. And because it is so close to the star, it is unlikely to be a cold ice giant like Neptune. Three other purported rocky planets have been reported, but they orbit a pulsar, the flashing corpse of an exploded star.
</p>
<p>
  "This planet will be historic," said team leader Geoffrey Marcy, professor of astronomy at UC Berkeley. "Over 2,000 years ago, the Greek philosophers Aristotle and Epicurus argued about whether there were other Earthlike planets. Now, for the first time, we have evidence for a rocky planet around a normal star."
</p>
<p>
  Marcy and three other members of the team--Paul Butler of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, UCSC postdoctoral researcher Eugenio J. Rivera, and theoretical astronomer Jack Lissauer of NASA Ames Research Center--presented their findings June 13 during a press conference at the National Science Foundation in Arlington, Va. The research, conducted at the Keck Observatory in Hawaii, was supported by NSF, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the University of California.
</p>
<p>
  A paper detailing the results has been submitted to the <i>Astrophysical Journal.</i> Coauthors on the paper are Vogt and Gregory Laughlin of UCSC, Debra Fischer of San Francisco State University, and Timothy M. Brown of the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo.
</p>
<p>
  Gliese 876 (or GJ 876) is a red, M dwarf star--the most common type of star in the galaxy--and, at about one-third the mass of the Sun, the smallest star around which planets have been discovered. The Marcy team detected the first planet in 1998, a gas giant about twice the mass of Jupiter. In 2001 they reported a second planet, another gas giant about half the mass of Jupiter. The two are in resonant orbits, the outer planet taking 60 days to orbit the star, twice the period of the inner giant planet.
</p>
<p>
  Rivera and Lissauer have been analyzing Keck data on the Gliese 876 system in order to model the unusual motions of the two known planets, and three years ago got an inkling that there might be a smaller, third planet orbiting the star. In fact, if they hadn't taken account of the resonant interaction between the two known planets, they never would have seen the third planet.
</p>
<p>
  "We had a model for the two planets interacting with one another, but when we looked at the difference between the two-planet model and the actual data, we found a signature that could be interpreted as a third planet," Lissauer said.
</p>
<p>
  A three-planet model consistently gave a better fit to the data, added Rivera. "But because the signal from this third planet was not very strong, we were very cautious about announcing a new planet until we had more data," he said.
</p>
<p>
  Recent improvements to the Keck Telescope's high-resolution spectrometer (HIRES) provided crucial new data. Vogt, who designed and built HIRES, worked with the technical staff in the UC Observatories/Lick Observatory Laboratories at UCSC to upgrade the spectrometer's CCD (charge coupled device) detectors last August.
</p>
<p>
  "It is the higher precision data from the upgraded HIRES that gives us confidence in this result," Butler said.
</p>
<p>
  The team now has convincing data for a planet orbiting very close to the star, at a distance of about 10 stellar radii. That's less than one-tenth the size of Mercury's orbit in our solar system.
</p>
<p>
  "In a two-day orbit, it's about 200 degrees Celsius too hot for liquid water," Butler said. "That tends to lead us to the conclusion that the most probable composition of this thing is like the inner planets of this solar system--a nickel/iron rock, a rocky planet, a terrestrial planet."
</p>
<p>
  "The planet's mass is enough that it is capable of holding onto an atmosphere," noted Laughlin, an assistant professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC. "It would still be considered a rocky planet, probably with an iron core and a silicate mantle. It could even have a dense steamy water layer. I think what we are seeing here is something that's intermediate between a true terrestrial planet like the Earth and a hot version of the ice giants Uranus and Neptune."
</p>
<p>
  With the HIRES upgrade and improved computer software, the team can now measure the Doppler velocity of a star to within 1 meter per second--human walking speed--instead of the previous precision of 3 meters per second. This improved sensitivity will allow the planet-hunting team to detect the gravitational effect of an Earthlike planet within the habitable zone of M dwarf stars like Gliese 876.
</p>
<p>
  "We are pushing a whole new regime at Keck to achieve 1 m/s precision, triple our old precision, that should also allow us to see these Earth-mass planets around Sunlike stars within the next few years," Butler said.
</p>
<p>
  "Our UC Santa Cruz and Lick Observatory team has done an enormous amount of optical, technical, and detector work to make the Keck Telescope a rocky planet hunter, the best one in the world," Marcy added.
</p>
<p>
  Lissauer also is pleased by another feat reported in the <i>Astrophysical Journal</i> paper. For the first time, he, Rivera, and Laughlin have determined the line-of-sight inclination of the orbit of the stellar system solely from the observed Doppler wobble of the star. Using dynamical models of how the two Jupiter-size planets interact, they were able to calculate the masses of the two giant planets from the observed shapes and precession rates of their orbits. (Precession is the slow turning of the long axis of a planet's elliptical orbit.) The researchers showed that the orbital plane is tilted at an angle of 40 degrees to our line of sight. This allowed the team to estimate the most likely mass of the third planet as seven and a half Earth masses.
</p>
<p>
  "There's more dynamical modeling involved in this study than in any previous study, much more," Lissauer said.
</p>
<p>
  The team plans to continue to observe the star Gliese 876, but is eager to find other terrestrial planets among the 150 or more M dwarf planets they observe regularly with Keck.
</p>
<p>
  "So far we find almost no Jupiter-mass planets among the M dwarf stars we've been observing, which suggests that, instead, there is going to be a big population of smaller-mass planets," Butler noted.

<p>
  Most of the excess carbon dioxide pouring into the atmosphere from the burning of fossil fuels will ultimately be absorbed by the oceans, but it will take about 100,000 years.
</p>
<p>
  That is how long it took for ocean chemistry to recover from a massive input of carbon dioxide 55 million years ago, according to a study published this week in the journal <i>Science.</i><br>
</p>
<p>
  James Zachos, professor of Earth sciences at UCSC, led an international team of scientists that analyzed marine sediments deposited during a period of extreme global warming known as the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM). Sediment cores drilled from the ocean floor revealed an abrupt change in ocean chemistry at the start of the PETM 55 million years ago, followed by a long, slow recovery.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "Most people have not thought about the long-term fate of all that carbon and what's involved in removing it from the system. There is a long timescale for the recovery, tens of thousands of years before atmospheric carbon dioxide will start to come back down to preindustrial levels," Zachos said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Earlier studies using computers to run numerical models of Earth's carbon cycle have calculated similarly long timescales for absorption of the carbon dioxide currently being released into the atmosphere from fossil fuels, he said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "Our findings are consistent with what the models have been showing for years. What we found validates those geochemical models," Zachos said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The oceans have a tremendous capacity to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Results from a large international research effort published last year indicated that the oceans have already absorbed nearly half of the carbon dioxide produced by humans in the past 200 years--about 120 billion metric tons of carbon.<br>
</p>
<p>
  When carbon dioxide dissolves in water it makes the water more acidic. Ocean acidification starts at the surface and spreads to the deep sea as surface waters mix with deeper layers. The sediment cores studied by Zachos and his coworkers showed the effects of a rapid acidification of the ocean during the PETM. The acidification was more severe than they had expected, suggesting that the amount of carbon dioxide that entered the atmosphere and triggered global warming during the PETM was much greater than previously thought.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The leading explanation for the PETM is a massive release of methane from frozen deposits found in the deep ocean near continental margins. The methane reacted with oxygen to produce huge amounts of carbon dioxide. Both methane and carbon dioxide are potent greenhouse gases and caused temperatures to soar during the PETM. Average global temperatures increased by about 9 degrees Fahrenheit (5 degrees Celsius), and the fossil record shows dramatic changes during this time in plant and animal life, both on land and in the oceans.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Previous estimates for the amount of greenhouse gas released into the atmosphere during the PETM were around 2,000 billion tons of carbon. Zachos said at least twice that much would be required to produce the changes observed in this new study.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "This is similar to the estimated flux from fossil fuel combustion over the next three centuries," he said. "If we combust all known fossil fuel reserves, that's about 4,500 billion tons of carbon. And now we know that the recovery time for a comparable release of carbon in the past was about 100,000 years."<br>
</p>
<p>
  The study's conclusions hinge on the effects of ocean acidification on the chemistry of calcium carbonate, the mineral from which certain kinds of phytoplankton (microscopic algae) and other marine organisms build their shells. When these organisms die, their shells rain down onto the seafloor.
</p>
<p>
  Marine sediments are typically rich in calcium carbonate from these shells, but increased acidity causes it to dissolve. The dissolution of calcium carbonate enables the ocean to store large amounts of carbon dioxide in the form of bicarbonate ions.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "The calcium carbonate sitting on the seafloor increases the ocean's buffering capacity, so that it can eventually neutralize most of the changes in acidity caused by the carbon dioxide accumulating in the atmosphere," Zachos said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Sediments deposited at the start of the PETM show an abrupt transition from carbonate-rich ooze to a dark-red clay layer in which the carbonate shells are completely gone. Above the clay layer, the carbonates gradually begin to reappear.<br>
</p>
<p>
  This transition at the Paleocene-Eocene boundary was already well known from previous studies of sediment cores by Zachos and others. The new <i>Science</i> paper, however, presents the first results from a series of sediment cores covering the PETM over a broad range of depths in the ocean. The cores were recovered in 2003 from Walvis Ridge in the southeastern Atlantic Ocean.<br>
</p>
<p>
  This series of sediment cores enabled the researchers to trace changes in ocean chemistry over time at different depths in the ocean. This is important because the chemical equilibrium between solid calcium carbonate (calcite) and dissolved calcium and carbonate ions changes with depth. The dissolution of calcite increases not only with acidity, but also at the colder temperatures and higher pressures found in the deep ocean.<br>
</p>
<p>
  At a certain depth--currently 4 kilometers (2.4 miles) in the southern Atlantic--the calcite shells of dead plankton drifting down from the surface waters begin to dissolve. The point at which the dissolution rate exceeds the supply rate of calcite from above is called the carbonate compensation depth (CCD). The distinctive layers of clay that mark the PETM in sediment cores indicate that those sites were below the CCD at the time those sediments accumulated.<br>
</p>
<p>
  In the series of sediment cores from different depths on Walvis Ridge, Zachos and his coworkers observed a rapid shoaling (rising toward the surface) of the CCD due to the acidification of ocean waters.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "The CCD shoaled quickly from below the deepest site to above the shallowest site, producing a clay layer with no carbonate. And then the carbonate starts to reappear, first at the shallowest site, then deeper, eventually reaching the deepest site," Zachos said. "The time lag before the carbonates start to reappear is about 40 to 50 thousand years, and then it's another 40 thousand years before you see the normal carbonate-rich ooze again."<br>
</p>
<p>
  The dissolution of calcium carbonate provides only temporary storage of carbon dioxide. When the dissolved ions recombine to form calcite again, carbon dioxide is released. The long-term storage of carbon dioxide is accomplished through chemical weathering of silicate rocks, such as granite and basalt, on the land. As weathering removes carbon dioxide, however, the same buffering process that slowed the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere starts to operate in reverse, gradually releasing stored carbon from the ocean back into the atmosphere.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "The ocean's role is to act like a temporary store for the carbon until these chemical weathering processes can remove it from the system. This is the theory of ocean carbonate chemistry that we were taught in graduate school, and here is a case study where you can actually see it happen," Zachos said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  These changes in ocean chemistry during the PETM coincided with a sharp reduction in marine biodiversity. For example, many species of bottom-dwelling phytoplankton that form calcite shells went extinct, possibly as a direct result of ocean acidification, Zachos said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Within the past year, scientists have begun to detect similar changes in ocean chemistry in response to the rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide from fossil fuel consumption and other human activities. Researchers have also begun to worry about the potential ecological effects of ocean acidification. Whatever the effects may be of current increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide, we will probably have to live with them for a long time.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "Even after humans stop burning fossil fuels, the impacts will be long-lasting," Zachos said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  In addition to Zachos, the authors of the <i>Science</i> paper are Ursula Rohl of the University of Bremen, Germany; Stephen Schellenberg of San Diego State University; Appy Sluijs of Utrecht University, The Netherlands; David Hodell of the University of Florida; Daniel Kelly of the University of Wisconsin, Madison; Ellen Thomas of Wesleyan University and Yale University; Micah Nicolo of Rice University; Isabella Raffi of G. d'Annunzio University, Italy; Lucas Lourens of Utrecht University; Heather McCarren, a graduate student in Earth sciences at UCSC; and Dick Kroon of Vrije University, The Netherlands.<br>
</p>
<p>
  This study was conducted as part of a five-year interdisciplinary project funded by the National Science Foundation to investigate the consequences of greenhouse warming for biocomplexity and biogeochemical cycles. In a related study led by Lourens and published this week in the journal <i>Nature,</i> the researchers reported on a similar, less extreme global warming event that occurred 2 million years after the PETM.<br>

<p>
  Members of the Class of 2005 capped their campus careers with a weekend of commencements and celebrations beginning on Friday, June 10 , and culminating on Sunday, June 12.
</p>
<p>
  Caps and gowns filled the campus as graduates of 10 colleges and the Jack Baskin School of Engineering made everything official.
</p>
<p>
  Starting things off on Friday, June 10, was the Graduate Division commencement, with keynote speaker Chancellor Denice D. Denton.
</p>
<p>
  The chancellor also addressed graduates at the College Ten and School of Engineering commencement exercises.
</p>
<p>
  A total of 2,346 students were candidates for bachelor of arts, music, or science degrees. Also this spring, 215 students were eligible to receive master of arts or science degrees (of these students, 112 will complete UCSC's Department of Education master's program in late summer), and 61 students are candidates for doctorates. A small number of students will receive graduate certificates.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Before the formal graduation, the spirit of celebration filled the campus, as a number of student groups--from student parents to African American students--were honored in a variety of ceremonies.<br>

        <title>History grad off to Taiwan on Fulbright Scholarship</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_5964" align="alignright" width="230"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/06/walsh_katie2.06-06-13.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-5964" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/06/walsh_katie2.06-06-13.jpg" alt="Katie Walsh Photo: Scott Rappaport" width="230" height="199" /></a>Katie Walsh Photo: Scott Rappaport[/caption]
<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  In two weeks, Katie Walsh will touch down in Taiwan to begin an 11-month adventure--teaching English and American culture to elementary schoolchildren as a Fulbright Scholar.
</p>
<p>
  The 21-year-old College Ten student has just received her bachelor of arts degree in history from UCSC with an emphasis on Asia and the Middle East.
</p>
<p>
  She marked the occasion by delivering the student commencement address on Saturday at her college graduation ceremonies.
</p>
<p>
  A transfer student from Bryn Mawr, Walsh came to UCSC in the fall of 2003 after taking a year off to work for the educational wing of AmeriCorps.
</p>
<p>
  "Essentially it's the domestic Peace Corps," Walsh noted. "During the mornings, I mentored six second graders learning English as a second language who had just come over from mainland China; in the afternoon, I was a teacher for 29 third graders."
</p>
<p>
  Upon her arrival at UCSC, Walsh found her niche on campus at the College Ten International Living Center where she resided for a year with students from a variety of countries around the world. She soon became the coordinator of the International Affairs Group, a student organization that met every week to talk about politics and culture.
</p>
<p>
  Walsh also participated in the Chancellor's Undergraduate Internship Program, working with Praxis--a service-learning organization at Colleges Nine and Ten. "We did a number of different community-service projects throughout Santa Cruz for groups like the Homeless Garden Project and Jacob's Heart, which provides support for children with cancer," Walsh said. "We also helped out with a benefit concert that was held at the Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium to raise money for Oxfam, the global relief agency."
</p>
<p>
  Last spring, Walsh also found time to travel to Mexico with a group of 30 students as part of UCSC's Alternative Spring Break program, to help build a house for a Mexican family.
</p>
<p>
  Walsh said that she has been very impressed with the quality and support offered to her by faculty during her time at UCSC. "When I first transferred here, I took a course in history with Alan Christy and his class was amazing and intriguing--he was unlike any professor I had encountered at Bryn Mawr," she noted. "And I've taken classes from Gail Hershatter who has been extremely approachable, supportive, and inspiring--she helped me with my academic and career plans."
</p>
<p>
  "What also makes UCSC so dynamic and powerful has been the activism on this campus--how passionate students are and how committed they are to social justice," Walsh added. "That passion doesn't exist at many other campuses."
</p>
<p>
  After returning from Taiwan in 2006, Walsh plans to further her education--by traveling throughout Asia to visit friends and contacts she made at the College Ten International Living Center--before considering a possible career in education and public policy. "To successfully do education, community, and social justice work, I feel it's essential to learn and understand the history of different cultures," she observed.

<p>
  Creating "greener" campuses won't be all talk and no action when UCSC hosts the fourth annual statewide Sustainability Conference, June 20-21.
</p>
<p>
  One of the exhibitors on hand, Biosystem Solutions, will compost some of the food waste from the conference, turning it into premium earthworm castings.
</p>
<p>
  A wide range of other products--from water-saving plumbing to "green" roofing to a car-sharing service--will also be showcased.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "Building a Sustainable Campus Community" is the theme for the conference, expected to draw more than 400 students, staff, and faculty members. The conference is designed to provide campus planners and other staff with the concrete tools and knowledge for incorporating sustainability practices.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "California's universities and community colleges are uniquely positioned to help make sustainability practices a vital force in society," said Chancellor Denice D. Denton. "UC Santa Cruz is proud to host this conference to highlight best practices and new technologies in green building and energy efficiency."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Chancellor Denton will speak at the opening of the conference, planned by the UC Santa Cruz Chancellor's Sustainability Action Council. Speakers from business, engineering, higher education, and other fields will share their expertise on subjects ranging from building design to how to make dining services more sustainable.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The conference includes participants from the University of California and California State University systems as well as representatives of private and community colleges, said organizer Diane Behling, senior facilities analyst in Capital Planning and Space Management at UC Santa Cruz.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "We want to build collaborations among all the higher education campuses in the state so we can learn from each other's experiences and share new technologies and best practices," Behling said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  In addition to the chancellor, UC Santa Cruz campus architect Frank Zwart and Harrison Fraker, dean of the College of Environmental Design at UC Berkeley, will address the opening session.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Students have been involved in the effort from the start, and the list of topics reflects their concerns. In addition to such subjects as energy, transportation, and composting, there will also be sessions on ways of incorporating sustainability into college curricula and examples of successful student-led sustainability organizations.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The conference will be supplemented by extensive pre- and post-conference events, including field trips to Long Marine Lab and the UC Santa Cruz Farm & Garden on June 19, and workshops on June 22.<br>
</p>
<p>
  A June 22 workshop is offered by the U.S. Green Building Council, which developed the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design standards now being applied to "green" building projects around the world. This workshop at the Stevenson Event Center--for building owners, facility managers, and design teams--will cover the technical requirements and process for achieving certification under the newly released standards for existing buildings.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The conference is sponsored in part by the University of California/California State University/Investor-Owned Utility Energy Efficiency Partnership under the auspices of the Public Utilities Commission.<br>
</p>

  A schedule of events, including demonstrations by exhibitors, is available online at <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/sustainabilityconf2005/">www2.ucsc.edu/sustainabilityconf2005/schedule.htm</a><br>

<p>
  It's time once again for the annual Strawberry Shortcake Festival at the UCSC Farm. This year's gathering will take place Wednesday, May 25, from 4 to 6 p.m. A $5 donation will get you a huge serving of shortcake smothered in organic strawberries and freshly whipped cream, along with homemade lemonade or coffee from the Community Agroecology Network. After your treat, you'll want to enjoy a Farm tour and some homegrown bluegrass music. Sponsors of the festival include New Leaf Community Markets and Clover Stornetta Farms.
</p>
<p>
  Your donation supports low-income shares in the UCSC Farm's Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) program, which is celebrating its 10th anniversary this year.
</p>
<p>
  The CSA project makes fresh organic produce grown at the UCSC Farm available to households that invest directly in the Farm for an entire growing season. Every week from June through October, CSA members receive a share of the harvest, including organic fruits, vegetables, flowers, and herbs you can pick yourself in the CSA garden. The CSA is a mutually beneficial collaboration between the community and the Farm.
</p>
<p>
  If you would like to join the CSA, shares are still available. Full shares cost $600 and typically feed four to six people for about $27/week. Smaller households are encouraged to team up and split a full share. Payment can be in full or in quarterly installments. Low-income shares are available for $300 each. Members pick up boxes weekly on either Tuesday or Friday at the CSA Barn on the UCSC Farm. Members also receive a weekly newsletter with recipes, farm updates, and a schedule of events; complimentary membership in the Friends of the Farm & Garden for one year; a 10 percent discount on plants at the Farm's spring and fall plant sales; quarterly issues of News & Notes; and two issues of <i>The Cultivar</i>.

<p>
  Plans to begin construction on 45 single-family homes at Ranch View Terrace, Phase I, the latest on-campus housing for faculty and staff, were approved May 25 by the UC Board of Regents.
</p>
<p>
  Groundbreaking on the project is expected in middle to late August, with completion scheduled for fall 2006, said Faculty and Staff Housing manager Steve Houser.
</p>
<p>
  The first phase of Ranch View Terrace will be composed of 20 three-bedroom houses and 25 four-bedroom houses. <a href="http://housing.ucsc.edu/housing/rvtbrochure.pdf">Additional details on the project</a> (pdf file).<br>
  <br>
  If you are not currently on the waiting list for housing and are interested in enrolling for an opportunity to purchase one of these units, contact the Faculty and Staff Housing Office at (831) 458-3506 or <a href="mailto:facultyhousing@ucsc.edu">facultyhousing@ucsc.edu</a>.

<p>
  The Friends of Long Marine Lab will hold its 20th annual "Whale of an Auction," the group's popular annual fundraiser, on Friday, June 17. The event will take place in the Porter College Dining Hall, starting at 6 p.m.
</p>
<p>
  Over the past 20 years, the auction has grown from humble beginnings into a lavish affair featuring a catered buffet, fine wines, champagne, and lots of excitement. The event includes both live and silent auctions. Tickets for the evening are $75 at the door. For additional information, call (831) 459-3800.
</p>
<p>
  Highlights of the items up for bid at this year's auction include exclusive vacation retreats in Paris, St. Barts, Kauai, La Quinta, Puerto Vallarta, Napa, San Francisco, and other exciting locales; a private history and geology tour of Point Lobos with UCSC geologist Gary Griggs and historian Sandy Lydon; field trips, research cruises, private presentations, and behind-the-scenes tours with renowned Long Marine Lab scientists; specialty wines and private wine-tasting tours; private art, baking, and cooking classes; a bumper-car party for 50 at the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk; a lobster and clambake for 20 on the beach catered by the Crow's Nest Restaurant; artwork, jewelry, and exquisite blown glass; sports equipment and tickets to sporting events; and much, much more.
</p>
<p>
  All education programs and daily operations of the lab's <a href="http://seymourcenter.ucsc.edu/">Seymour Marine Discovery Center</a> depend on community support. Contributions to the Whale of an Auction help bring marine science alive for the community. Last year's event was a great success, with more than 400 bidders who helped raise more than $80,000 in crucial funds for the Seymour Center.
</p>
<p>
  The Seymour Center at Long Marine Lab is dedicated to educating people about the role scientific research plays in the understanding and conservation of the world's oceans. Research conducted by UCSC scientists in Monterey Bay and around the world is featured in the center's exhibits, along with galleries of aquaria, seawater tables, an 87-foot blue whale skeleton, and much more. Located at the end of Delaware Ave. in Santa Cruz, the Seymour Center is open to the public every day except Mondays. Long Marine Lab is a research facility of the Institute of Marine Sciences at UCSC.

<p>
  The Friends of Long Marine Lab will hold its 20th annual "Whale of an Auction," the group's popular annual fundraiser, on Friday, June 17. The event will take place in the Porter College Dining Hall, starting at 6 p.m.
</p>
<p>
  Over the past 20 years, the auction has grown from humble beginnings into a lavish affair featuring a catered buffet, fine wines, champagne, and lots of excitement. The event includes both live and silent auctions. Tickets for the evening are $75 at the door. For additional information, call (831) 459-3800.
</p>
<p>
  Highlights of the items up for bid at this year's auction include exclusive vacation retreats in Paris, St. Barts, Kauai, La Quinta, Puerto Vallarta, Napa, San Francisco, and other exciting locales; a private history and geology tour of Point Lobos with UCSC geologist Gary Griggs and historian Sandy Lydon; field trips, research cruises, private presentations, and behind-the-scenes tours with renowned Long Marine Lab scientists; specialty wines and private wine-tasting tours; private art, baking, and cooking classes; a bumper-car party for 50 at the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk; a lobster and clambake for 20 on the beach catered by the Crow's Nest Restaurant; artwork, jewelry, and exquisite blown glass; sports equipment and tickets to sporting events; and much, much more.
</p>
<p>
  All education programs and daily operations of the lab's <a href="http://seymourcenter.ucsc.edu/">Seymour Marine Discovery Center</a> depend on community support. Contributions to the Whale of an Auction help bring marine science alive for the community. Last year's event was a great success, with more than 400 bidders who helped raise more than $80,000 in crucial funds for the Seymour Center.
</p>

<p>
  The Friends of Long Marine Lab will hold its 20th annual "Whale of an Auction," the group's popular annual fundraiser, on Friday, June 17. The event will take place in the Porter College Dining Hall, starting at 6 p.m.
</p>
<p>
  Over the past 20 years, the auction has grown from humble beginnings into a lavish affair featuring a catered buffet, fine wines, champagne, and lots of excitement. The event includes both live and silent auctions. Tickets for the evening are $75 at the door. For additional information, call (831) 459-3800.
</p>
<p>
  Highlights of the items up for bid at this year's auction include exclusive vacation retreats in Paris, St. Barts, Kauai, La Quinta, Puerto Vallarta, Napa, San Francisco, and other exciting locales; a private history and geology tour of Point Lobos with UCSC geologist Gary Griggs and historian Sandy Lydon; field trips, research cruises, private presentations, and behind-the-scenes tours with renowned Long Marine Lab scientists; specialty wines and private wine-tasting tours; private art, baking, and cooking classes; a bumper-car party for 50 at the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk; a lobster and clambake for 20 on the beach catered by the Crow's Nest Restaurant; artwork, jewelry, and exquisite blown glass; sports equipment and tickets to sporting events; and much, much more.
</p>
<p>
  All education programs and daily operations of the lab's <a href="http://seymourcenter.ucsc.edu/">Seymour Marine Discovery Center</a> depend on community support. Contributions to the Whale of an Auction help bring marine science alive for the community. Last year's event was a great success, with more than 400 bidders who helped raise more than $80,000 in crucial funds for the Seymour Center.
</p>
<p>
  The Seymour Center at Long Marine Lab is dedicated to educating people about the role scientific research plays in the understanding and conservation of the world's oceans. Research conducted by UCSC scientists in Monterey Bay and around the world is featured in the center's exhibits, along with galleries of aquaria, seawater tables, an 87-foot blue whale skeleton, and much more. Located at the end of Delaware Ave. in Santa Cruz, the Seymour Center is open to the public every day except Mondays. Long Marine Lab is a research facility of the Institute of Marine Sciences at UCSC.

<p>
  There's no doubt about it: UCSC's first Graduate Research Symposium won't be its last.
</p>
<p>
  "It's succeeded beyond what we envisioned," said associate dean of graduate studies Lisa Sloan as students, staff, and faculty crowded into the Graduate Commons on June 2 to look over research posters and view research presentations.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Sloan said the event had been optimistically titled the "first annual" symposium, but it is now a sure thing to return next year.<br>
</p>
<p>
  A series of 10-minute oral presentations highlighted the variety of research being conducted:<br>
</p>
<p>
  * Science and journalism came together in <a href="http://people.ucsc.edu/%7Emboykoff/">Max Boykoff's</a> analysis of global climate change and the U.S. mass media. Boykoff's research forms the basis of an article he plans to submit to the journal <i>Science.</i><br>
</p>
<p>
  * <a href="http://www.soe.ucsc.edu/%7Eamyn/">Amyn Poonawala</a> found a way to make his research on optical microlithography understandable to even the technologically-impaired.<br>
</p>
<p>
  * Research on sea otters' physiological constraints, presented by <a href="http://bio.research.ucsc.edu/people/williams/laura/">Laura Yeates</a>, provided interesting insights into the challenges these animals face.<br>
</p>
<p>
  And that was just a sampling of the 12 talks. (A complete list of presentations is available online at <a href="http://www.graddiv.ucsc.edu/gradsymposium.html">graddiv.ucsc.edu/gradsymposium.html</a>.)<br>
</p>
<p>
  Supplementing the oral presentations were a live soundscape presentation and presentations with computers, video, and television/DVD players.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Several graduate students also had the opportunity to explain their research projects to Chancellor Denice D. Denton, who circulated through the research displays, talking with students and visitors. She was joined by Interim Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor David Kliger.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The event drew rave reviews from participating students. Sloan said several of the graduate students thanked her for organizing the event. "The graduate students really enjoy seeing what their peers are doing in other divisions."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Alisa Neeman of computer science agreed. "For me, it's a chance to see presentations on something other than computer science," said Neeman, on hand to present her research on computer science digitization. "It's a big eye-opener. It's amazing that so many things are going on on campus that you don't know about. And it's all fun."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Catherine Plesko of Earth sciences saw an additional benefit. "It's great to see what's out there for potential collaborations." Standing in front of her research poster, Pesko explained that she is developing a technique using artificial intelligence to count craters of a certain size on Mars. The new method takes less than a second per image, while each image takes people about half an hour to count. "When you consider the number of images that need to be surveyed, it makes an impossible task possible," she said. Her <a href="http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2005/pdf/1971.pdf">most recent paper</a> is posted online.<br>

<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  In 1987, earthbound observers saw a star explode in the nearby dwarf galaxy called the Large Magellanic Cloud. Astronomers eagerly studied this supernova--the closest seen in the past 300 years--and have continued to examine its remains.
</p>
<p>
  Although its blast wave lit up surrounding clouds of gas and dust, the supernova appears to have left no core behind. Astronomers now report that even the sharp eyes of the Hubble Space Telescope failed to locate the black hole or ultracompact neutron star they believe was created by the star's death 18 years ago.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "We think a neutron star was formed. The question is: Why don't we see it?" said Genevieve Graves, a graduate student in astronomy at UCSC and first author on the paper announcing these results.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "Therein lies the mystery--where is that missing neutron star?" mused coauthor Robert Kirshner of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA). Graves worked on the study as an undergraduate at CfA.<br>
</p>
<p>
  When a massive star explodes, it leaves behind some sort of compact object, either a city-sized ball of subatomic particles called a neutron star, or a black hole. The outcome depends on the mass of the progenitor star. Smaller stars form neutron stars while larger stars form black holes.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The progenitor of supernova (SN) 1987A weighed 20 times as much as the Sun, placing it right on the dividing line and leaving astronomers uncertain about what type of compact object it produced. All observations to date have failed to detect a light source in the center of the supernova remnant, leaving the question of the outcome unanswered.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Detecting a black hole or neutron star is challenging. A black hole can be detected only when it swallows matter, because the matter heats up and emits light as it falls into the black hole. A neutron star at the distance of the Large Magellanic Cloud can be detected only when it emits beams of radiation as a pulsar, or when it accretes hot matter like a black hole.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "A neutron star could just be sitting there inside SN 1987A, not accreting matter and not emitting enough light for us to see," said Peter Challis, an astronomer at CfA and second author on the study.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Observations have ruled out the possibility of a pulsar within SN 1987A. Even if the pulsar's beams were not aimed at the Earth, they would light the surrounding gas clouds. However, theories predict that it can take anywhere from 100 to 100,000 years for a pulsar to form following a supernova, because the neutron star must gain a sufficiently strong magnetic field to power the pulsar beam. SN 1987A may be too young to hold a pulsar.<br>
</p>
<p>
  As a result, the only way astronomers might detect the central object is to search for evidence of matter accreting onto either a neutron star or a black hole. That accretion could happen in one of two ways: spherical accretion, in which matter falls in from all directions, or disk accretion, in which matter spirals inward from a disk onto the compact object.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The Hubble data rule out spherical accretion because light from that process would be bright enough to detect. If disk accretion is taking place, the light it generates is very faint, meaning that the disk itself must be quite small in both mass and radial extent. Also, the lack of detectable radiation indicates that the disk accretion rate must be extremely low--less than about one-fifth the mass of the Moon per year.<br>
</p>
<p>
  In the absence of a definitive detection, astronomers hope to learn more about the central object by studying the dust clouds surrounding it. That dust absorbs visible and ultraviolet light and reradiates the energy at infrared wavelengths.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "By studying that reprocessed light, we hope to find out what's powering the supernova remnant and lighting the dust," said Graves. Future observations by NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope should provide new clues to the nature of the hidden object.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Additional observations by Hubble also could help solve the mystery. "Hubble is the only existing facility with the resolution and sensitivity needed to study this problem," said Kirshner.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Headquartered in Cambridge, Mass., the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA) is a joint collaboration between the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory and the Harvard College Observatory. CfA scientists, organized into six research divisions, study the origin, evolution, and ultimate fate of the universe.<br>

        <title>Sociology major wins grant to fund U.S. speaking tour of Chiapas artisans</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 06 Jun 2005 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>5924</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  For sociology major Kara Deyhle, economic empowerment isn't just a catch phrase. Watching Mayan women in Chiapas, Mexico, organize to save their families and their culture brought textbook lessons to life and inspired Deyhle to join their work.
</p>
<p>
  Deyhle (pronounced "dial") recently won a $10,000 scholarship to bring two women from Chiapas to the United States for a speaking tour that will give them access to U.S. markets for their artistic textiles.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Deyhle's work in Mexico began during a six-month internship in Chiapas, the southern state of Mexico where the Zapatista-led army of indigenous peasants rose up in 1994, calling for land reform, Indian rights, and democracy. Home to a large population of indigenous peoples, Chiapas is rich in natural resources but one of the poorest places in Latin America.
</p>
<p>
  Women are at the forefront of efforts to build economic opportunities, however, and Deyhle worked closely with a weaving cooperative run and organized entirely by Mayan women.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The cooperative of 350 weavers from six highland communities in Chiapas, <a href="http://www.worldofgood.com/orgs/jolom_mayaetik.shtml">Jolom Mayae'tik</a> was formed in 1996 in the wake of sharply declining wages and rising costs of living to give indigenous women some economic and political autonomy. Their work re-creating ancient textile designs and natural dyeing techniques is revitalizing an endangered cultural identity.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "It's really amazing, what these women are doing," said Deyhle, describing how women move to the city from their remote villages, where strict gender roles are the rule and residents have little contact with the outside world. "It takes such strength to move the city, where they are confronted with racism and have no role models or people who understand what they are going through. It's revolutionary."
</p>
<p>
  Under the auspices of UCSC's <a href="http://giip.ucsc.edu/">Global Information Internship Program</a> (GIIP), which brings the skills of the information age to nonprofit and grassroots organizations around the world, Deyhle helped the cooperative computerize its data so members can identify and evaluate trends in sales and production. She produced a digital inventory of JolomMayae'tik's store in San Cristobal de las Casas and is working on a digital catalog of weaving designs that will help the cooperative market its artistic textiles internationally.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "I feel like I have learned so much here that I can't even explain how valuable it has been," said Deyhle. "It puts into perspective all that I have learned in the classroom. I feel like in the classroom I was getting half of the picture, and coming here and seeing everything filled a huge gap in my understanding and learning process."
</p>
<p>
  Deyhle had an inkling that bringing cooperative members to the United States would be more effective than impersonal Internet marketing, at least initially, and she applied to the <a href="http://www.straussfoundation.org/">Donald A. Strauss Public Service Scholarship Foundation</a> for funding for a senior-year project.<br>
</p>
<p>
  This spring, Deyhle won a $10,000 scholarship that will underwrite her dream. A member of Jolom Mayae'tik and a woman from a nongovernmental organization called K'inal Antzetik that helps women's collectives and cooperatives with administration and organization will spend three weeks in the United States, giving presentations about their work, grassroots organizing, and alternative business models while making direct connections with more-affluent U.S. markets for their products.
</p>
<p>
  During the "cultural exchange" tour, the women will visit UCSC, University of New Mexico, University of Florida, and Hartwick College in New York.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "I want them to be able to pass on their knowledge and experience, and have an opportunity to sell their artwork," said Deyhle, who will use a small portion of the funds to buy crafts from the cooperative to sell on the tour; profits will be used to purchase additional products to sell in fair-trade shops in the United States.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Deyhle learned that she had won the scholarship via e-mail while she was in Mexico. "I was so surprised and was in total shock," she said of receiving news. "I felt my whole life changing in one moment as I replanned everything. It took a few days for it to sink in, and I was walking around in a daze for a while."
</p>
<p>
  Each year, the Donald A. Strauss Public Service Scholarship Foundation awards at least 14 scholarships to California college juniors who have proposed public-service projects for their senior year. Donald Strauss of Newport Beach demonstrated a lifelong commitment to public service and education. He died in 1995 at the age of 79; his widow, Dorothy M. R. Strauss, established the foundation in 1997 as a tribute to her husband.<br>

<p>
  Congressman Sam Farr praised the National Endowment for the Arts for providing support to Shakespeare Santa Cruz (SSC) at last Friday's final 2005 performance by Shakespeare To Go at UCSC's Second Stage Theater.
</p>
<p>
  Farr spoke after a 50-minute performance of <i>The Winter's Tale,</i> in front of an audience made up of schoolchildren from Boulder Creek, faculty, staff, and students.
</p>
<p>
  It marked the conclusion of a two-month tour of the play that included 48 performances in 37 venues before more than 8,000 middle and high school students from Santa Clara to Monterey.<br>
</p>
<p>
  This year's tour was significantly augmented due to the NEA's "Shakespeare for a New-Generation" initiative--the largest Shakespeare project in American history--designed to provide students in all 50 states with the opportunity to experience professional theater productions of Shakespeare's plays. The program also provides free educational materials to thousands of classrooms to enhance the educational impact. SSC received a grant of $25,000.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "I congratulate everyone at Shakespeare Santa Cruz who has invested time and effort into this wonderful production," said Farr. "This NEA funding is essential to ensuring that high quality programs like Shakespeare To Go are able to continue bringing art to schools and communities, so that everyone in our country has the opportunity to learn and appreciate the rich cultural and artistic history of our world."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Shakespeare To Go was established by SSC 16 years ago in collaboration with the Theater Arts Department. Each year, a member of the theater arts faculty directs a 50-minute version of a play that will be presented at the next SSC summer festival. The play is rehearsed during winter quarter, and performances take place in the schools during the months of April and May in Santa Cruz, Monterey, and Santa Clara Counties.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "This has been the biggest tour we've ever done because grant money has allowed us to go places we've never gone before," noted Sara Wilbourne, tour manager for Shakespeare To Go. "For example, because of the NEA grant, we were able to go to Salinas this year. And with the help of a grant from the AT&T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am Youth Fund, we were able to go to additional schools in the Monterey area."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Wilbourne added that SSC also received an additional grant from the Community Foundation Silicon Valley to enable performances in Santa Clara County.<br>
</p>
<p>
  SSC is one of 22 theater companies across the country that received the NEA grants. After noting that the United States spends more on advertising national agricultural products than it does on the National Endowment for the Arts, Farr said he is working hard to dispel the notion that there is not a role for the government in promoting the arts.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "I'm proud that the NEA brought $25,000 to this program," Farr said. "And I'm going to work like mad to see that we get more next year."<br>

<p>
  Researchers from UCSC and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) have invented a new method for controlling the emission of carbon dioxide from power plants.
</p>
<p>
  The technique, which mimics natural weathering processes, converts carbon dioxide gas into soluble compounds that can be disposed of in the oceans.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Any strategy for curbing the progress of global warming is likely to include technology that captures and stores carbon dioxide, a byproduct of burning fossil fuels that is widely regarded as the leading contributor to global climate change.
</p>
<p>
  About one third of U.S. carbon emissions comes from large point sources such as power plants.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "It has become clear to me that in addition to ringing alarm bells about the carbon dioxide problem, Earth scientists need to also think about ways to help solve the problem, beyond just leaving fossil fuels in the ground," said coinventor Gregory Rau, a research scientist with UCSC's Institute of Marine Sciences who also works at LLNL.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Rau and LLNL researcher Ken Caldeira developed the new carbon sequestration method, called Accelerated Weathering of Limestone. The U.S. Department of Energy, which sponsored their work, has now patented the technology.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The process involves reacting carbon dioxide in the stream of waste gas from a power plant with water and calcium carbonate (limestone) or other carbonate compounds. Instead of carbon dioxide emissions, the plant generates wastewater rich in soluble bicarbonate ions, which can be released beneath the surface of the ocean. Rau said he expects this would have little impact on the ocean.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "Limestone weathering is one of the ways the Earth naturally mitigates increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide," Rau said. "But nature is slow. We propose to speed up the limestone weathering reaction."<br>
</p>
<p>
  When carbon dioxide dissolves in water, the water becomes acidic, which makes it corrosive to limestone. Dissolution of limestone by carbonated water generates soluble bicarbonate ions. This is the process by which rainwater erodes limestone cliffs and creates limestone caves and sinkholes.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Because the waste-gas stream of a power plant has a high carbon dioxide concentration, water acidification will be rapid and will lead to an efficient dissolution of the limestone, Rau said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  In one of the model systems devised by Rau and Caldeira, waste gases bubble up through a slurry of water and limestone particles. Water is constantly sprinkled onto the slurry, and wastewater laden with bicarbonates is pumped out.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The bicarbonates in the wastewater are in equilibrium with dissolved carbon dioxide. Direct contact with ambient air would shift the equilibrium, resulting in the escape of carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere. To prevent this, the wastewater must be released below the ocean surface, where it can mix and be diluted with ocean water before coming into contact with the atmosphere.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Alternative techniques for carbon sequestration include capture and purification of waste carbon dioxide, followed by direct injection into the deep ocean or underground into depleted oil fields or salt formations. But these methods are costly, and deep ocean injection would not neutralize the acidifying potential of carbon dioxide, Rau said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Oceans absorb a large portion of the carbon dioxide present in the atmosphere. Scientists expect that the acidification of oceans resulting from increased atmospheric carbon dioxide will have deleterious effects on marine life, especially corals, mollusks, and other creatures that make their shells or skeletons out of calcium carbonate.<br>
</p>
<p>
  But wastewaters from Accelerated Weathering of Limestone would carry the waste carbon mostly in the form of dissolved bicarbonates, which should minimize adverse effects and might even benefit coral reefs, Rau said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Coal-burning power plants already use limestone scrubbing to remove sulfur dioxide from their smokestack emissions, he said. It might be possible to combine sulfur and carbon dioxide removal in one step or in successive steps. Alternatively, Accelerated Weathering of Limestone might be more appropriate for power plants that burn natural gas, a cleaner fuel that does not require sulfur removal. In either case, the water needed for the sequestration reaction could come from the vast quantities of water already used as coolant, Rau said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Accelerated Weathering of Limestone would be most cost effective in gas-burning plants located close to water and limestone sources, he said. These conditions are met by several power plants along the Florida and California coasts, which could serve as testing grounds for this carbon dioxide sequestration method.<br>

<p>
  During his recent sabbatical at the University of Amsterdam, sociology professor Craig Reinarman delivered nearly a dozen invited lectures on drug-policy issues and participated in numerous scholarly conferences.
</p>
<p>
  Reinarman gave several talks about his recent research comparing marijuana use in Amsterdam and San Francisco, including a presentation during the "Second Perspectives on Cannabis Conference" in Liverpool, England, and a talk about use patterns under decriminalization, entitled "Does All Hell Break Loose?" that was presented at the International Drug Policy Conference in London. He also discussed the study during an invited lecture at The Centre for Social Research on Alcohol and Drugs at Stockholm University in Sweden.
</p>
<p>
  In January, Reinarman delivered a talk, "Racism and the War on Drugs," during a conference in London focused on the politics, philosophy, and economics of drugs. He discussed drug mythology and drug policy during invited talks in the Netherlands and Wales, and he helped organize two panels in Belfast about harm reduction during the 16th International Conference on the Reduction of Drug-Related Harm.<br>
  <br>
  Reinarman chaired a panel on youth and drugs during a conference about drugs and alcohol that was held in London, and he discussed public health and human rights during an invited public lecture at the Addiction Research Centre at Trinity College in Dublin. He gave a talk, called "Looking Back at Crack: Media, Myths, and the Politics of Imprisonment," in Liverpool, and he wrapped up his sabbatical with an invited lecture, called "The Politics of Drugs and Crime in the USA," at the Willem Pompe Institute for Criminal Law and Criminology at Utrecht University in the Netherlands.

        <title>STEPS Institute awards student fellowships and grants</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 06 Jun 2005 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>5910</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  Five graduate students at UCSC were selected last month to receive fellowships from the STEPS Institute for Innovation in Environmental Research. Three students received $20,000 fellowships for interdisciplinary environmental research, and two students received $9,000 fellowships for biodiversity conservation research.
</p>
<p>
  In addition to the graduate fellowships announced last month, the institute awarded smaller research grants to 20 graduate students and six undergraduates in January.
</p>
<p>
  The STEPS Institute supports environmental research and policy through initiatives that aim to forge new collaborations among researchers at UCSC, policy makers, and environmental managers. The institute organizes workshops, provides fellowships and grants, and helps to establish new environmental research facilities on the UCSC campus.
</p>
<p>
  The two fellowships in biodiversity conservation were awarded to Carolyn Kurle, a graduate student in ecology and evolutionary biology who is studying the effects of introduced predators on intertidal communities in the Aleutian Islands; and Sara Bothwell, a graduate student in environmental studies who is investigating the effects of landscape diversity on populations of parasitic wasps that provide biological control of agricultural pests.
</p>
<p>
  Formally known as the M.R.C. Greenwood Fellowship Award in Biodiversity Conservation, these $9,000 fellowships are supported by a generous gift from Diane and Donald Cooley, longtime supporters of UCSC. The fellowship award is administered by the STEPS Institute in collaboration with the UCSC Arboretum.
</p>
<p>
  The other three fellowships were awarded to incoming graduate students Andrea Jani, Jae Pasari, and Autumn Lynn Harrison. These $20,000 STEPS fellowships are funded by an anonymous donor and named in honor of three individuals with links to the campus and an interest in science and society. Jani was awarded the Christine Eckstrom Fellowship, Pasari received the Frans Lanting Fellowship, and Autumn Lynn Harrison was awarded the M.R.C. Greenwood Fellowship.
</p>
<p>
  Jani will be working with Ingrid Parker, associate professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, and Gregory Gilbert, associate professor of environmental studies, to study host-pathogen interactions and the relationships between disease dynamics, population ecology, and community ecology. Pasari will be working with Erika Zavaleta, assistant professor of environmental studies, to explore the relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem functioning in Central Coast ecosystems. Harrison will study marine biology with Daniel Costa, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology.
</p>
<p>

  Chancellor Denton (first row, center) hosted the 11th Annual Student Employee Recognition Award Ceremony at University House on May 20. The ceremony honored 277 students for their academic excellence and outstanding service to the university this year. Supervisors gave their students certificates of appreciation and cash awards ranging from $100 to $2,000, totaling $57,000.
</p>
<p>
  Barbara Bedford, executive director of the Career Center, which sponsors the event, welcomed the group, and she was followed by student speakers Jackie Bertuleit, Jessica Pierce, Woo Suk (Will) Sim, and Liam Welcher. Between presentations, the audience, including parents, siblings, campus leaders, faculty, and staff, was entertained by Big Mac and the Insomniacs and vocalist Carla St. Juste, a UCSC student. Student Cynthia Payne videotaped the ceremony for later broadcast on Community TV.

        <title>Astronomical Society of the Pacific awards highest honor to astronomer Robert Kraft</title>

<p>
  The Astronomical Society of the Pacific has awarded the 2005 Catherine Wolfe Bruce Gold Medal to Robert P. Kraft, professor emeritus of astronomy and astrophysics and former director of the UC Observatories/Lick Observatory (UCO/Lick). Kraft is the sixth astronomer associated with the Lick Observatory to receive this award, and the fourth associated with UCSC.
</p>
<p>
  The Bruce Medal is the highest honor bestowed by the Astronomical Society of the Pacific (ASP). It recognizes scientists worldwide for fundamental and lifelong contributions to the field of astronomy. Previous recipients include many renowned astronomers, such as 1938 medalist Edwin P. Hubble, who showed the universe is expanding, and 2003 medalist Vera Rubin, who demonstrated the existence of dark matter.
</p>
<p>
  Kraft has received many awards in his long and distinguished career, but he said the Bruce Medal holds special significance. "The Bruce Medal I cherish the most since it has the longest history and is given on a worldwide basis," Kraft said. "The list of recipients contains a lot of my heroes, such as Otto Struve and Jesse Greenstein, and I feel really honored to be on that list."
</p>
<p>
  In announcing the award, the ASP acknowledged Kraft's outstanding research achievements and extensive service to the astronomy community.
</p>
<p>
  Kraft served as director of UCO/Lick from 1981 to 1991. During this time he played a key role in bringing about the W. M. Keck Observatory on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, by committing the resources of Lick Observatory to the construction and instrumentation of the world's first 10-meter telescope, now known as Keck I. Keck I and its twin, Keck II, remain the largest optical and infrared telescopes ever built. UCO/Lick operates the Keck Observatory in cooperation with Caltech and NASA.
</p>
<p>
  Kraft also served as president of the American Astronomical Society from 1974 to 1976 and president of the International Astronomical Union from 1997 to 2000.
</p>
<p>
  As a researcher, Kraft made important contributions to the understanding of novae, stars that undergo a sudden increase in brightness due to massive nuclear explosions. He showed that all novae arise from close binary star systems in which the more evolved star (usually a white dwarf) siphons up hydrogen and helium from its expanding companion. The transferred material forms a disk whose rapid accretion onto the dense white dwarf leads to an explosion. Kraft also established an important rung on the ladder of celestial distances by assessing the contribution of interstellar dust to the dimming of Cepheid variables in the disk of our galaxy. His work on stellar rotation--now a fundamental topic in astronomy textbooks--showed that stars like the Sun spin slower and slower as they age because winds of charged particles carry away their angular momentum.
</p>
<p>
  Kraft became interested in the chemical composition of stars after observing an unusual star named FG Sagittae, which underwent rapid changes in composition and later nearly disappeared behind a cloud of its own soot. He went on to analyze in detail the chemical composition of the oldest stars in our galaxy. This work led to several major contributions, including evidence for deep mixing of elements in red giants, bloated stars at a late stage of their evolution. He also established intriguing differences between the chemical composition of stars in globular clusters and their neighboring field stars.
</p>
<p>
  Kraft, 77, earned his B.S. and M.S. in mathematics from the University of Washington and his Ph.D. in astronomy from UC Berkeley. He rose to prominence in the 1960s as an astronomer at the Mt. Wilson and Palomar Observatories in Pasadena. He joined UC Santa Cruz in 1967 as an astronomer at Lick Observatory and professor of astronomy and astrophysics, after holding assistant professor positions at Indiana University and the University of Chicago.
</p>
<p>
  Soon after joining UC Santa Cruz, Kraft was elected to both the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1995, the American Astronomical Society named Kraft the Henry Norris Russell Lecturer for his lifetime achievement in astronomy. Kraft's work currently focuses on the abundance of rare earth elements in globular clusters.
</p>
<p>
  The Astronomical Society of the Pacific was founded in San Francisco in 1889 and has awarded the Catherine Wolfe Bruce Gold Medal most years since 1898. From the outset, the medal was meant for astronomers of any nationality and either gender, and might only be awarded when a suitable candidate was found. The ASP board of directors selects a medalist among candidates nominated each year by the directors of six observatories--three in the United States and three elsewhere in the world.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_5905" align="alignright" width="130"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/06/hurtado_aida2.130.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-5905" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/06/hurtado_aida2.130.jpg" alt="Aida Hurtado" width="130" height="171" /></a>Aida Hurtado[/caption]
<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  Aida Hurtado, professor of psychology, has been named the new director of the <a href="http://www.lals.ucsc.edu/clrc/about.html">Chicano/Latino Research Center</a> (CLRC). Her three-year term begins July 1.
</p>
<p>
  Hurtado succeeds anthropology professor Olga Najera-Ramirez.
</p>
<p>
  Hurtado, who is head of the social psychology doctoral program at UCSC, focuses her research on the study of social identity (including ethnic identity), Latino educational issues, and feminist theory. She was recently elected chair of the National Association for Chicana/Chicano Studies, the largest organization representing ethnic studies in the United States. Her books include <i>The Color of Privilege: Three Blasphemies on Race and Feminism; Voicing Feminisms: Young Chicanas Speak Out on Sexuality and Identity</i>; and <i>Chicana Feminisms: A Critical Reader</i>, coedited with Gabriela Arredondo, Norma Klahn, Najera-Ramirez, and Patricia Zavella. Her latest book is <i>Chicana/o Identity in a Changing U.S. Society: ?Quien soy? ?Quienes somos?</i> coauthored with Patricia Gurin.
</p>
<p>
  Founded in 1992, the center supports research on Latina/o and Latin American issues with a goal of promoting "crossborder perspectives linking the Americas." The CLRC fosters collaborative work among scholars in the United States, Mexico, Central America, and South America, as well as among scholars at UCSC. The center supports interdisciplinary approaches that span the social sciences, humanities, and cultural studies. Much of the center's work focuses on transborder issues that reflect the movement of populations back and forth across the borders of North, Central, and South America. The center also sponsors cultural events that are open to the public, including film screenings, lectures, and workshops.
</p>
<p>
  About 40 UCSC faculty members are CLRC research associates, and nearly 30 graduate students are doing work on Chicano/Latino themes under the auspices of CLRC.

        <title>Students OK some fee increase proposals, reject others</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 30 May 2005 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>5884</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  Students voted to raise their fees $27 per quarter for Student Health Center improvements and approved some smaller fee increases in the spring campus election.
</p>
<p>
  Defeated were proposals for a multiuse student event center ($175/quarter); athletic, intramural, and club teams ($24/quarter), and multiuse outdoor events/soccer venue ($45).
</p>
<p>
  Results are available on the campus elections web site: <a href="http://elections.ucsc.edu/elections05/results.html">elections.ucsc.edu/elections05/results.html</a>; details on each ballot item are also online, at <a href="http://elections.ucsc.edu/elections05/ballot.html">elections.ucsc.edu/elections05/ballot.html</a><br>
</p>
<p>
  Fee increases approved were:
</p>
<p>
  * <a href="http://elections.ucsc.edu/elections05/measures.cfm#measure13">Measure 13: Student Media Council Fee</a>
</p>
<p>
  * <a href="http://elections.ucsc.edu/elections05/measures.cfm#measure14">Measure 14: Campus Sustainability Programs Fee Increase</a><br>
  <br>
  * <a href="http://elections.ucsc.edu/elections05/measures.cfm#measure15">Measure 15: Community and Resource Empowerment "CARE"</a>
</p>
<p>
  * <a href="http://elections.ucsc.edu/elections05/measures.cfm#measure16">Measure 16: Student Voice and Empowerment Fee</a><br>
  <br>
  * <a href="http://elections.ucsc.edu/elections05/measures.cfm#measure17">Measure 17: Modification to Engaging Education Programs Fee Language (Measure 10)</a>
</p>
<p>
  * <a href="http://elections.ucsc.edu/elections05/measures.cfm#measure18">Measure 18: Student Health Center Facilities Improvement Fee</a>
</p>
<p>
  Undergraduate voter turnout was 33.3 percent, and graduate turnout 19.5 percent, said Gail Heit, associate vice chancellor of Student Affairs.
</p>
<p>
  One measure, the graduate Campus Sustainability Programs Fee Increase, failed to meet the minimum voting pool requirement of 25 percent, Heit said. Undergraduates passed the measure by 57.30 percent, with a voter turnout of 29.31 percent, but graduate students did not pass Measure 14, and had a voter turnout of 18.59 percent. Although 62.04 percent of the graduate students voted "yes," the vote failed because voter turnout was below 25 percent.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The Student Health Center Facilities Improvement Fee of $27/quarter will go into effect for graduates and undergraduates upon completion of the renovations, estimated to be fall 2009, Heit said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  If the fee increases are approved by the UC President Robert C. Dynes, fall 2005 undergraduate fees will increase by $14.95/quarter.<br>
  <br>

        <title>Chancellor Denton says staff issues are high priority</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 30 May 2005 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>5882</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_5881" align="alignright" width="200"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/05/denton_forum.05-05-30.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-5881" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/05/denton_forum.05-05-30.jpg" alt="Chancellor Denton outlined some of her plans and took questions on everything from parking to Tent Uity at her spring forum.

<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  Staff issues, including salaries, recruitment, workload, and reclassification procedures, are among Chancellor Denice D. Denton's highest priorities, she announced during the spring brown-bag forum with staff.
</p>
<p>
  "Clearly, there's been way too much cutting of staff during the last four, five, six years, and it's not a sustainable situation," Denton told a crowd of about 250 people.<br>
</p>
<p>
  For the first time in several years, the governor's proposed budget includes funding for 3 percent increases in staff salaries.
</p>
<p>
  Although salaries for represented employees must be negotiated, Denton said she would like staff salaries to "be competitive with the market."<br>
</p>
<p>
  In addition, Denton said she has done some "homework" since her first staff forum in March and learned that UC Berkeley, UCSF, and UCLA adopted higher staff salary structures in the early 1980s. "Obviously we're not a lower cost-of-living city than those three cities anymore," she said.
</p>
<p>
  Denton will undertake a two-pronged effort to see "what we can do as a campus without going through [the UC Office of the President in] Oakland" while also seeing what can be done systemwide to guarantee equity in staff salary levels among the campuses and identify resources for staff salaries.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "It's really clear to me that there's a tremendous level of frustration and anger over the salary structure--of staff and faculty," said Denton.<br>
</p>
<p>
  While staff issues took center stage during the forum, Denton also outlined her other top priorities for the coming year:<br>
</p>
<p>
  * Enhancing academic excellence and diversity;<br>
</p>
<p>
  * Identifying new opportunities for academic programs, such as professional schools;<br>
</p>
<p>
  * Enhancing the national and international reputation of UCSC;<br>
</p>
<p>
  * Implementing plans for the campus that have been developed in recent years.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Accomplishing those goals will require a balancing act between resources and priorities, said Denton, who expressed appreciation for the success of the Cornerstone Campaign, which surpassed the $50 million fundraising goal by raising $65 million.<br>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Alternative to formal inauguration</b>
</p>
<p>
  Denton also announced her decision to forgo a traditional, formal inauguration in favor of a period of scholarly symposia and fundraising activities that will culminate with the annual Scholarships Benefit Dinner on November 5.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "Instead of spending money and staff time on ceremony, we'll be investing in our campus's academic priorities and our students," she said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Responding to a question about Tent University, Denton provided context for the decisions that were made by detailing several incidents in the weeks prior to the student encampment that involved a "level of physical aggression and violence that hadn't been seen before on the Santa Cruz campus."<br>
</p>
<p>
  A student intern required surgery for serious injuries suffered during the career fair, at which students protested the presence of military recruiters on campus, said Denton. In addition, staff members were knocked over during dining-hall gatherings that preceded the recent AFSCME strike, and rocks were thrown through the living-room windows of a provost's home and the tires of the provost's family's vehicles were slashed, she added.<br>
</p>
<p>
  This "different environment" informed decisions made by staff, administrators, and Academic Senate leadership as they developed strategies for the Tent University protest, said Denton, adding that Tent University participants chose to resist arrest. "This wasn't civil disobedience," she said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "It was not the typical month at UC Santa Cruz, and an Academic Senate panel of students, staff, and faculty will review Tent University in the context of the arc of events," said Denton. "People were acting in good faith, people were making good decisions. We did the best we could in a difficult situation."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Responding to a question about recent strikes, Denton said she has met with local labor leaders to better understand the issues "so I can be a more effective advocate in Oakland." Denton, who took office February 14, said there are several other chancellors who would like to "increase the effectiveness of bargaining sessions."<br>
</p>
<p>
  "I'd like to be able to avoid having strikes," she said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Campus to charge for bus passes</b>
</p>
<p>
  As always at staff forums, parking and transportation were hot topics. Rates for A, B, and R parking permits will not increase during the next fiscal year, according to Wes Scott, director of Transportation and Parking Services. Rates will increase 5 percent for participants in campus carpool and vanpool programs, and a $2/month charge for bus passes will be implemented, said Scott. In addition, parking enforcement will be extended until 8:30 p.m.; evening parking permits will be available for $2/night for those who don't already have parking permits.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Some programs, including the carpool, vanpool, and bus-pass programs, have been heavily subsidized in the past, and the changes are designed to "spread it out a little bit," Scott said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The campus is negotiating with Metro to provide regular service to 2300 Delaware and Long Marine Laboratory, said Scott, who responded to a question about the shortage of parking on campus by noting that it will only get worse as infill construction continues and buildings go up on the level sites in the core of campus. Most of the parking planned for the future will be on the periphery of campus, he added.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Regarding the campuswide diversity initiative, Denton is launching quantitative and qualitative studies with an eye toward implementation beginning this fall. Diversity is central to excellence, she said, adding that her own definition of diversity encompasses gender, ethnicity, race, class, physical ability, gay/lesbian/bisexual/transgender, and nation of origin.
</p>
<p>
  One of the first tasks of the Committee on Affirmative Action and Diversity will be to identify a campus definition of diversity, she noted.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "What we have to do is create an environment that really does embrace difference," she said. "I'm not hearing that we've achieved that environment."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Denton endorsed the Academic Senate's imminent "request for proposals" regarding the development of professional schools and other academic endeavors, perhaps involving external partners and Silicon Valley links. David Kliger, interim campus provost and executive vice chancellor, will work with the five divisions to implement their academic plans, and he will examine student-staff ratios this summer to assess staff workload levels. Vice Chancellor Tom Vani will head a task force assigned to streamline staff human resource processes, including recruitment and retention.<br>

        <title>Making sense of the campus's LRDP project</title>

<p>
  In an effort to provide additional information to the campus community about the process of updating the campus's Long Range Development Plan, <i>Currents</i> is periodically discussing various aspects of the LRDP with campus personnel.
</p>
<p>
  This month's Q&A is with Jean Marie Scott, associate vice chancellor of Colleges and University Housing Services. AVC Scott is an expert on housing issues related to the planning project.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Q. How would you assess UCSC's record of meeting students' housing needs?</b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>A.</b> UCSC has one of the finest portfolios of housing inventories in the nation. During the past five years alone, the campus has added housing for approximately 2,000 additional students, and our housing options are enhanced by an incredible array of dining services and coffee shops. The backbone of UCSC housing is our system of residential colleges, which transform a physical living experience into a vibrant and engaging learning experience for our students.
</p>
<p>
  During this past fall quarter, UCSC housed approximately 44 percent of our undergraduate students in university-sponsored housing. That's the highest percentage in the UC system and one of the highest in the nation for public universities.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Q. What aspects of housing are most challenging for a campus like UCSC that is growing?</b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>A.</b> On UC campuses, housing is a self-supporting enterprise, which means that 100 percent of the costs for operations and debt must be covered by the rental rate structure and other revenue generated from the enterprise. As we have added significant amounts of housing to our inventory in recent years, the debt for these units has added substantially to our overall rate structure. We spread this debt over a long period of time so that the impact on rates is gradual. But the recent acceleration of UCSC housing growth has placed a strain on our rate structure.
</p>
<p>
  It is also critical to understand that our ability to grow university housing is dependent on conditions in our regional housing market. In other words, we try to ensure that our rate structure doesn't make it so that on-campus housing is too expensive to compete with regional housing. In addition to considering the availability and price of local housing, before we begin every project we conduct an extensive demand analysis to forecast absorption rates for the new housing. National research models, as well as recent research conducted on our campus, suggest that the average yield of undergraduate students into university housing at four-year public institutions may top out at about 50 percent. In other words, due to a variety of developmental, financial, and social reasons, even if the campus were to build housing capacity to 70 percent of undergraduates, the likely yield might not exceed 50 percent.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Q. What is the latest on UCSC's efforts to provide housing for faculty and staff?</b>
</p>
<p>
  <b>A.</b> The campus is moving into the last set of approvals for the Ranch View Terrace Project. Now that we have the approval of the Regents, groundbreaking is scheduled for August 2005. This project is planned to deliver 45 single-family homes in Phase I of construction and a total of 39 homes in Phases II and III.

<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  Five senior engineering students at UCSC are trying to push the limits of low-power wireless transmission to facilitate the monitoring of remote natural environments.
</p>
<p>
  The apparatus they are building will track conditions on coral reefs in distant locations and beam information back in real time to a land-based station.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The students named their creation SEA-LABS, short for "Sensor Exploration Apparatus utilizing Low-power Aquatic Broadcasting System."
</p>
<p>
  SEA-LABS was originally designed to help UCSC biologist Donald Potts track environmental changes that affect the reefs of Midway, a remote atoll of the Hawaiian archipelago. But SEA-LABS also has the potential to become a low-cost tsunami-warning device, said Matt Bromage, a computer engineering student who acts as SEA-LABS team manager.
</p>
<p>
  According to Potts, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, SEA-LABS should be a vast improvement over current satellite imaging technology, which provides low-resolution data at high cost. A typical satellite survey will provide average temperatures of the ocean surface over areas up to 60 square miles, he said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "But the corals living on a reef may experience temperatures that are 5 to 10 degrees different from that average. With SEA-LABS, we will have miniaturized instrumentation that we can place right where the corals and other animals and plants actually live," Potts said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The project began with a serendipitous encounter between Potts and Katia Obraczka, an associate professor of computer engineering whose research includes wireless sensor networks. Together they hatched the idea of a collaboration, which Obraczka proposed as a student project for the senior engineering design class.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Bromage and four classmates--electrical engineering senior Lee Wells and computer engineering seniors Chris Chan, Mike Maroney, and Jo Chou--volunteered. The students said they were attracted by the opportunity to build something that had practical applications and would have an impact.
</p>
<p>
  Now entering its final testing stages, the project should culminate this summer with a trip to the Midway atoll, 1,200 miles northwest of Honolulu, where the students will install and test their waterproof and salt-resistant prototype.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Wireless data transmission is a big advantage of SEA-LABS over other commonly used environmental sensors, Bromage said. "Currently, the state of the art for remote monitoring is a sensor attached to a data logger, but you need to go out and retrieve the logger after a set amount of time," he said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Data loggers collect and store data but do not transmit it. SEA-LABS will send information in real time, first through a wireless connection to a land station on Midway, then through an Internet connection between Midway and the mainland. Ideally, traveling the 2,800 miles between Santa Cruz and Midway to service SEA-LABS would only be necessary once a year.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The core of SEA-LABS is a Programmable Ocean Device (POD), which consists of a processor, a memory storage component, and a battery that can last up to two years, all housed in a waterproof casing about the size of a small wastebasket. The POD can be bolted to the seafloor near a reef. It must be completely waterproof at depths up to 60 feet and sturdy enough to withstand heavy wave action.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The POD has cable connections to sensors that independently record pressure, light, salinity, and temperature. The sensors are small enough to fit in any desired location on or within a reef and can be placed right next to plants, corals, and other reef inhabitants.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The pressure sensors monitor wave patterns, tides, and overall sea levels. Eventually, real-time recordings from these sensors could be used to help detect a tsunami wave.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The POD connects to a receiver/transmitter attached to a surface buoy. The transmitter broadcasts the data recorded by the sensors from the POD to a base station on land via a radio antenna. The challenge for this step is to find a good compromise between signal strength and battery life, Obraczka said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "You can always increase signal strength by increasing power, but then the battery will run out sooner," she said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  On the other hand, if the signal from the POD is too low, the land antenna might not be able to pick it up, which would result in incomplete data collections. With an antenna 150 feet above ground and transmitters on one-foot high buoys, SEA-LABS should work within a five- to seven-mile range. That range should accommodate the geography of the Midway reef, Potts said. But the final tuning of SEA-LABS will only be possible at Midway.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "The problem is that wireless transmission is very sensitive to the environment," Obraczka said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The Midway atoll consists of three small islands surrounded by a well-developed reef. A U.S. Navy base for over 50 years, the atoll became a National Wildlife Refuge under the jurisdiction of the Fish and Wildlife Service in 1996. Since then it has suffered minimal human impact, which makes it a good place to study ecological and evolutionary responses to changing natural conditions, Potts said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The health of a reef depends on complex interactions between corals and algae, which themselves depend on water temperature, depth, salinity, and acidity. Potts expects the environmental impacts of global climate change to become detectable on Midway and its reef in the near future, but predicting what will happen is difficult.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "The physical environment is unpredictable and the climatic conditions unstable," Potts said. "As climatic conditions change, the patterns of winds, storms, currents, and upwellings will change at a regional scale."<br>
</p>
<p>
  An important goal of the SEA-LABS team is to provide technology that benefits users with small budgets, such as developing countries or U.S. wildlife reserves with limited government or private funding, Potts said. To this end, the students use off-the-shelf components and develop nonproprietary open-access software. Depending on the number of sensors attached to each POD, SEA-LABS should cost between $500 and $1,000 per POD. Eventually, mass production could lower the cost even further.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Though only two stations will be ready this summer, Potts would eventually like to install 10 stations along the Midway reef. According to Bromage, one of the best features of SEA-LABS is the ability of the PODS to communicate with each other and establish ad hoc networks. If a POD is too far from the base station, it can transmit its information to a nearby POD, which will relay it to another POD or to the base station.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The idea of the senior engineering design class is to mimic an industry environment, said computer engineering lecturer Stephen Petersen, who teaches the senior design class and advises SEA-LABS on radio frequency. While the students sharpen their engineering wits, they also learn to work as a team, a skill that will serve them well in future job settings.<br>
</p>
<p>
  And what happens to SEA-LABS after this summer, when the class graduates?<br>
</p>
<p>
  "We're hoping to pass it on to the next class so they can do something more sophisticated with it," Chan said.<br>
  <br>

<p>
  <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> book critic David Kipen recently observed that the <a href="http://humwww.ucsc.edu/dickens/">Dickens Project</a> at UCSC "may just be literary California's best-kept secret."<br>
</p>
<p>
  The project is nationally and internationally recognized as the premier center for Dickens studies in the world and is one of the leading sites for research on 19th-century British culture.<br>
</p>
<p>
  A scholarly consortium headquartered at UCSC, it consists of faculty and graduate students from eight general campuses of the University of California, as well as from 16 other major American and international universities--including the City University of New York, Stanford, MIT, Vanderbilt, USC, Princeton, Rice, NYU, Columbia, the University of Exeter in Britain, and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Founded in 1981 to stimulate collaborative research on the writings, cultural impact, and life of novelist Charles Dickens, as well as the Victorian age in general, the Dickens Project has gone on to cosponsor international conferences in Israel, France, South Africa, Italy, Great Britain, and Australia. It also publishes educational materials on Dickens and other Victorian writers and has produced three teaching resource kits in collaboration with the BBC, in addition to hosting numerous seminars and workshops for teachers, supporting the professional development of countless graduate students, and serving as an international clearinghouse for Dickens scholarship.<br>
</p>
<p>
  But the undisputed heart of the project is the Dickens Universe, a weeklong event held each summer among the redwood trees at UCSC that brings together college faculty, graduate students, high school teachers, undergraduates, Elderhostel participants, and members of the general public to focus on the study of one particular Dickens novel. The Dickens Universe combines elements of a research symposium, arts festival, book club, and summer camp all rolled into one big, unforgettable week of intellectual celebration.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "When we started, we had no idea it would last this long or continue to grow as it has," observed John Jordan, director of the Dickens Project and professor of literature at UCSC.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "I think it's been so successful because Dickens was a comic writer and a great storyteller," Jordan added. "He's a writer concerned with important social questions--poverty, hunger, child labor, homelessness, bureaucracy, class inequity, marriage, and the status of women. In addition to being a novelist, he was involved in all the social issues of his time and that fed into his work. So through the study of Dickens, we engage in an ongoing social commentary that is still relevant today."<br>
  <br>
  The 2005 Dickens Universe will focus on the novel <i>Little Dorrit</i> and culminate in a special weekend conference devoted to the topic "Dickens: Life and Afterlife." The Dickens Universe will run from July 31 to August 6, with the weekend conference overlapping from August 4 to 7.
</p>
<p>
  Jordan noted that there will be a number of special activities in honor of the 25th anniversary, reflecting on the history of the Dickens Project and remembering past participants.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "We will be making a special effort to bring back faculty from the early years and graduate student alumni," he said. "It promises to be a joyous occasion--a time to look back over a remarkable history of accomplishments, but also to set the course for a new quarter century of dynamic study and research."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Jordan recalled the origins of the Dickens Project, which he began in collaboration with founding director and UCSC professor of English and comparative literature Murray Baumgarten, and UC Riverside English professor Ed Eigner.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "When we met back in 1980 at Murray's home and sketched out the original idea for the project, we had two innovative distinctions in mind," Jordan noted. "We wanted to include members of the general public and not limit it to just faculty and graduate students. And we also wanted it to be different from our own personal experiences of graduate school--where you rarely got to know different faculty or graduate students on other campuses."<br>
</p>
<p>
  "There are not many multicampus research units that exist in the humanities," Jordan added. "We're certainly among the oldest."<br>
</p>

        <title>Survey seeks feedback on use of Service Centers</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 30 May 2005 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>5872</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  Faculty, staff, and students who have used Service Centers within the past year are being asked to participate in a short <a href="http://survey.ucsc.edu/BAS/Service_Centers">online survey</a>. The survey will continue through June 24.
</p>
<p>
  Designed to assess customer satisfaction with the current Service Center system, the data will be used to help establish service levels and priorities for the newly reorganized Purchasing and Staff Human Resources Departments, as well as the new unit being established within Financial Affairs, called the Financial Administrative Services Transactions office (or FAST).
</p>
<p>
  The reorganization is part of the Business Transformation Program (BTP), the consolidation of business service functions currently performed by the 26 existing Service Centers into three organizations. Additional information on the reorganization is available from a new monthly newsletter, <i><a href="http://bas.ucsc.edu:16080/btp/bulletin.html">BPT Update</a></i><a href="http://bas.ucsc.edu:16080/btp/bulletin.html">,</a> which has been sent out to faculty and staff as well as being available online.
</p>
<p>
  Results of the survey will be posted on the <a href="http://bas.ucsc.edu/btp">BTP web site</a> the first week of July. For more information, contact Susan Willats (<a href="mailto:willats@ucsc.edu">willats@ucsc.edu</a>) at (831) 459-3759.

<p>
  Don Juan, the legendary Spanish rogue and seducer, did get around in his day. Now the Don is coming to UCSC when the Music Department presents Mozart's Italian-language opera <i>Don Giovanni</i>, beginning on June 2 in the Music Center Recital Hall.
</p>
<p>
  Considered by many to be Mozart's finest opera, <i>Don Giovanni</i> is a successful combination of comic and dramatic opera. The work begins as Don Giovanni is leaving the bedroom of his latest conquest and ends with his descent into hell.
</p>
<p>
  <i>Don Giovanni</i> features the artistic efforts of an array of participants in addition to student performers: music lecturer Brian Staufenbiel directs; music professor Nicole Paiement conducts the UCSC Orchestra; lighting design is by Sylvie Vray; scenic design is by Legend Theatrical; costume design is by Marti Kranak; and wigs and makeup are by Jeanne Hurd. The opera will be sung in Italian with English supertitles.
</p>
<p>
  John Dizikes, professor emeritus and author of <i>Opera in America,</i> will present a preperformance talk before the final matinee performance on Sunday, June 5. The talk begins at 1:10 p.m. in the Music Center Recital Hall.
</p>
<p>
  <i>Don Giovanni</i> plays Thursday through Sunday, June 2-5 in the Music Center Recital Hall. Thursday, Friday, and Saturday performances are at 7:30 p.m.; Sunday's performance is at 2 p.m. Tickets are $18 general, $14 seniors, and $10 students. Seating is reserved. Tickets for the performance and the Dizikes talk are on sale at the UCSC Ticket Office (831) 459-2159.

<p>
  It's easy to grab a bag of fresh organic salad mix or a sumptuous bouquet at the UCSC Farm & Garden market cart, which opens for the summer on Friday, June 3.
</p>
<p>
  Located at the main entrance to campus, the popular produce and flower stand brings the fresh organic bounty of the Farm & Garden to cooks and flower lovers Tuesday and Friday afternoons from noon until 6 p.m.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The array of fresh organic fruits and vegetables grows as the season progresses, but early offerings include strawberries, tender lettuces, sweet carrots, tasty beets, and chard. As summer progresses, watch for sweet corn, flavorful dry-farmed tomatoes, gourmet potatoes, an array of sweet and hot peppers, apples, basil and other herbs, and more.<br>
</p>
<p>
  All proceeds benefit the UCSC Center for Agroecology & Sustainable Food Systems' apprenticeship program in ecological horticulture. For more information, call (831) 459-3240.

  Chancellor Denton (first row, center) hosted the 11th Annual Student Employee Recognition Award Ceremony at University House on May 20. The ceremony honored 277 students for their academic excellence and outstanding service to the university this year. Supervisors gave their students certificates of appreciation and cash awards ranging from $100 to $2,000, totaling $57,000.
</p>
<p>
  Barbara Bedford, executive director of the Career Center, which sponsors the event, welcomed the group, and she was followed by student speakers Jackie Bertuleit, Jessica Pierce, Woo Suk (Will) Sim, and Liam Welcher. Between presentations, the audience, including parents, siblings, campus leaders, faculty, and staff, was entertained by Big Mac and the Insomniacs and vocalist Carla St. Juste, a UCSC student. Student Cynthia Payne videotaped the ceremony for later broadcast on Community TV.

<p>
  Steve Kang, dean of UCSC's Baskin School of Engineering, has been awarded the 2005 Mac Van Valkenburg Award from the Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Circuits and Systems Society (CAS).
</p>
<p>
  The Van Valkenburg Award is the CAS society's highest honor and is given to a person who has made outstanding technical contributions in a field within the scope of the society and demonstrated outstanding leadership in the field. Kang received the award at the 2005 IEEE International Symposium on Circuits and Systems in Kobe, Japan, on May 25.
</p>
<p>
  The society recognized Kang "for fundamental contributions to VLSI design and design automation, and for leadership in education and within the IEEE Circuits and Systems Society." The award includes a plaque and a $2,000 cash prize.
</p>
<p>
  Kang, a professor of electrical engineering, came to UC Santa Cruz in 2001 from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where he was professor and department chair of electrical and computer engineering. His research interests include computer chip design (specifically, methods of very large-scale integration, or VLSI) and optimization of chip design for performance, reliability, and manufacturability; modeling and simulation of semiconductor devices and circuits; high-speed optoelectronic circuits and fully optical network systems; and nanoelectronics.

<p>
  For the fifth time in school history, UCSC's men's tennis team captured a national championship. But this time, the feat was accomplished on the team's home courts as the host school thrilled hundreds of very enthusiastic Slug supporters with a 4-1 victory over top-ranked Middlebury College of Vermont.
</p><i>Santa Cruz Sentinel</i><a href="http://www.santacruzsentinel.com/archive/2005/May/22/sport/stories/04sport.htm">(see story)</a>
<p>
  The NCAA-installed scoreboard on the East Field courts kept the overflow crowd buzzing as UCSC captured the doubles point by winning the first two doubles matches, seesaw affairs that looked like they could go either way. (They were ahead in the third, as well, when the doubles point was awarded to UCSC).
</p>
<p>
  When Matt Seeberger and Andrew Cohen captured their singles matches, all eyes turned toward Kevin Casey. When Casey overwhelmed his Middlebury opponent, 6-2, 6-1, a celebration at the East Field complex ensued, with players, families, friends, and other spectators rushing the court.
</p>
<p>
  UCSC's tennis team also captured the Division III crown in 1989, 1995, 1996, and 1998.

<p>
  In her spring-quarter address to UCSC's Academic Senate on Friday (May 20), Chancellor Denice D. Denton described several initiatives that she is advancing to address campus priorities. She also announced that she will forgo a formal inauguration, focusing resources instead on advancing an active agenda for positive change. "Instead of spending money and staff time on ceremony, we'll be investing in our campus's academic priorities and in support for our students," she emphasized.
</p>
<p>
  Among the initiatives that Denton announced is a two-part program to enhance the campus's academic excellence. First, she is funding a baseline study of campus diversity, in collaboration with the Senate Committee on Affirmative Action and Diversity. The study will commence over the summer, will comprise both quantitative and qualitative components, and will lead to recommendations for action in 2005-06.
</p>
<p>
  Second, she underscored support for a Request for Proposals (RFP) to identify academic initiatives, explicitly professional schools that would build on existing strengths and may also consider linkages to the Silicon Valley Center. Preliminary proposals are due October 1.
</p>
<p>
  Other initiatives involve the development of a partner hire policy; a detailed plan to address UCSC's housing challenges; and a streamlining of staff recruitment and reclassification processes. Each of the initiatives includes specific details for planned action, along with a timeline for completion.
</p>
<p>
  "All of this is going to take resources," the chancellor said. But she said she is determined to move the campus from the planning processes that have taken center stage in recent years to actual implementation of needed changes. "If we work together--students, staff, and faculty--we can really make great strides in moving forward in positive directions," she added.
</p>
<p>
  Denton--who has spent a busy first 100 days of her chancellorship meeting with students, staff, and faculty; alumni, community leaders, donors, campus labor leaders, news media, and corporate partners; and local, state, and federal government officials--said what she has learned about the campus has made her "even more impressed than I was upon my arrival." The chancellor was joined at the senate meeting by Interim Campus Provost David Kliger, who outlined a process for aligning the budget with these emerging priorities. He said the campus will continue to move forward on its administrative transformation projects, improvements that will not only produce long-term savings, but also will make processes more efficient.
</p>
<p>
  Budget decisions, Kliger said, will be made in two phases: allocation decisions concerning any new revenues, and realignment of the budget to reflect campus priorities.
</p>
<p>
  While he said there is a "huge disparity between the needs and wants of the campus and the resources available to address these needs and wants," both Kliger and Chancellor Denton said the budget news out of Sacramento was more upbeat recently.
</p>
<p>
  "This will be the first time in several years that our budget won't be reduced," Denton said. She also praised faculty, deans, and University Relations staff for their efforts resulting in $65 million raised during the nearly completed Cornerstone Campaign. The campaign to date has far exceeded the original $50 million goal.
</p>
<p>
  On the subject of activities in lieu of an inauguration, Denton said specific plans are still being crafted. The celebration will include an academic symposium on diversity and excellence, cultural events, and the annual benefit dinner to raise money for scholarships and fellowships. Planning is focusing on the period leading up to Saturday, November 5, the date of this yearaEUR(tm)s benefit dinner.
</p>
<p>
  Faculty members William Ladusaw (chair), Jean Brodie, Angela Davis, Joel Ferguson, Russell Flegal, Craig Haney, Nicole Paiement, Manuel Pastor, and Raquel Prado are serving on the committee to plan the academic components of the celebration.
</p>
<p>
  In senate action, faculty adopted a resolution, requesting that UCSC "offer plans for sufficient and affordable faculty, student, and staff housing" if the campus intends to grow beyond 15,000 students. Senators described the impact that an inadequate supply of affordable housing has on the campus goal of recruiting and retaining quality faculty.
</p>
<p>
  "This [issue] has clearly reached a crucial juncture," agreed Chancellor Denton, who pledged that her administration would consider options in loans and housing allowances, as well as evaluate other mortgage assistance programs in an effort to enable more faculty and staff to purchase homes at Ranch View Terrace and in other campus housing sites.
</p>
<p>
  The chancellor also promised that, by October, her administration would develop a set of recommendations on how the campus can more effectively build housing for students, staff, and faculty; these recommendations will include both on- and off-campus options, she said.
</p>
<p>
  Toward the beginning of the meeting, astronomy professor Sandra Faber presented a resolution thanking anthropology professor Alison Galloway for her two years of service as senate chair. With a prolonged standing ovation, the senate endorsed the resolution by acclamation.

<p>
  The great Sumatra-Andaman earthquake of December 26, 2004, was an event of stunning proportions, both in its human dimensions--nearly 300,000 lives lost--and as a geological phenomenon.
</p>
<p>
  The sudden rupture of a huge fault beneath the Indian Ocean unleashed a devastating tsunami. It was the largest earthquake in the past 40 years and was followed by the second largest just three months later (March 28, 2005) on an adjacent fault.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Modern monitoring technology gathered an unprecedented amount of seismological data on these extraordinary events.
</p>
<p>
  Three papers published in the May 20 issue of the journal <i>Science</i> by an international group of seismologists provide a comprehensive scientific analysis of the earthquakes.
</p>
<p>
  The Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology (IRIS), a university research consortium, played a central role in bringing about this coordinated report from three teams of experts. IRIS, funded by the National Science Foundation, operates a global network of seismic monitoring stations that provided much of the data for the analysis.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "We wanted to give as unified and comprehensive a report as possible, rather than having bits and pieces of it come out in separate papers," said Thorne Lay, professor of Earth sciences and director of the Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics at UCSC and chair of the board of directors of IRIS.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Lay organized the overall effort and solicited contributions for the three papers from leading seismological researchers at U.S. and international research programs. David Simpson, president of IRIS, helped Lay arrange for the papers to be published together in a special section of <i>Science.</i><br>
</p>
<p>
  "This is really a watershed event," Lay said. "We've never had such comprehensive data for a great earthquake, because we didn't have the instrumentation to gather it 40 years ago. And then the sheer size of the event is so awesome. It is nature at its most formidable, and it has been humbling to all of us who have studied it. The willingness of the seismological research community to work together to give a comprehensive report on the earthquake reflects our understanding of the importance of this event."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Lay is lead author of the first <i>Science</i> paper, which provides an overview of the two earthquakes, and he is a coauthor on the second paper, which focuses on the processes involved in the rupture of the fault. The third paper describes how the earthquakes caused the whole planet to vibrate with "free oscillations," like the ringing of a bell.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The two earthquakes are the largest that have happened since the global deployment of highly sensitive digital broadband seismometers. These instruments, deployed around the world by IRIS and other organizations, recorded both the huge ground motions from the mainshocks and the tiny motions from small aftershocks and free oscillations of the planet.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Record-setting features of the Sumatra-Andaman earthquake of December 26, 2005, include the longest fault rupture ever observed (1,200 to 1,300 kilometers, or 720 to 780 miles) and the longest duration of faulting (at least 10 minutes). The aftershocks included the most energetic earthquake swarm ever observed.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The ground motions during the prolonged, intense shaking of the mainshock were greater than in any earthquake previously recorded by global broadband seismometers. As far away as Sri Lanka, a thousand miles from the epicenter, the ground moved up and down by more than 9 centimeters (3.6 inches). Ground motions greater than 1 centimeter (0.4 inch), but too gradual to be felt, occurred everywhere on Earth's surface as seismic waves from the event spread around the globe.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The 10-minute duration of the rupture complicated the seismological analysis, Lay said. An earthquake generates many different kinds of seismic waves, including fast-moving P waves and slower-moving S waves. In an earthquake with a more typical duration of 30 seconds, S waves would start to arrive at seismic monitoring stations minutes after the P waves had passed. But in the Sumatra-Andaman earthquake, the P waves were still coming when the S waves started to arrive, making it hard to sort out the signals.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "Nobody's algorithms were tuned to work with this kind of earthquake, so we had to take all of the methods we have applied successfully to smaller earthquakes and expand and adapt them for this earthquake that just went on and on," Lay said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The new analysis gives the Sumatra-Andaman earthquake a seismic magnitude of at least 9.1, and possibly as high as 9.3. Earlier estimates had put it at magnitude 9.0. By comparison, the 1960 Chile earthquake was magnitude 9.5, and the 1964 Alaska earthquake was magnitude 9.2.
</p>
<p>
  The data from those earlier earthquakes are relatively limited, however, and small differences in magnitude may not be significant, Lay said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  For those who experienced California's 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake--a magnitude 6.9 event that caused major destruction from Santa Cruz to the San Francisco Bay Area--Lay noted that the ground shook more than 100 times harder during the Sumatra-Andaman earthquake. Even some of the aftershocks were more powerful than the Loma Prieta quake.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "Even among seismologists, we call this a monster earthquake," Lay said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The earthquake took place along the curving boundary between major plates of the Earth's crust, where the Indo-Australian plate plunges beneath the southeastern Eurasian plate. Before the fault ruptured, the edge of the Eurasian plate was being dragged downward by the descending Indo-Australian plate. Released by the rupture of the fault, the edge of the plate sprang back up, uplifting the ocean floor and setting off the tsunami that inundated coastal areas throughout the Indian Ocean. The fault slipped by as much as 15 meters (50 feet) in places, averaging about 10 meters (33 feet) of displacement along the segment off the northwestern tip of Sumatra where the quake was centered.<br>
</p>
<p>
  From the epicenter, the rupture expanded along the fault at a speed of about 2.5 kilometers per second (1.5 miles per second) toward the north-northwest. But the initial movement of the fault was much less along the northern segment than in the south. This was fortunate, because it spared much of the coastline in the north from the massive tsunami waves that caused so much destruction further south. Eventually, the northern part of the fault slipped about as much as the southern part, uplifting and tilting the Andaman Islands. The tilting of the islands shows that the northern part must have slipped about 10 meters, but much of that slip occurred gradually, without generating seismic waves.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "We think that slip was occurring in the northern part for about an hour, well after the 10 minutes of rapid motions were over," Lay said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  UCSC geophysicist Steven Ward generated models of the tsunami waves that document this long slip process. Ward used a unique recording of the tsunami spreading across the Indian Ocean obtained by a radar altimetry satellite <i>(Jason)</i> that happened to be passing overhead. The satellite data showed a trough in the central Bay of Bengal two hours after the earthquake, which is best explained by late slip beneath the Andaman Islands, according to Ward's tsunami models.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "The satellite image of the tsunami is quite exciting because such data open a new window through which earthquake rupture processes can be observed, and it also suggests that radar satellites might some day be able to provide direct real-time warning of an approaching tsunami wave," Ward said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  After the earthquake and the tsunami came the aftershocks, including the most energetic earthquake swarm ever observed. More than 150 earthquakes of magnitude 5 and greater occurred over a four-day period in late January on faults beneath the Andaman Sea that were activated by the rupture of the main fault along the plate boundary to the west. There were also numerous aftershocks of magnitude 6 and greater throughout the fault zone.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "It's an incredible aftershock series," Lay said. "It is hard to get a feeling for the scale of it. If you take the aftershock zone and superimpose it on California, it completely covers the state."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Then the March 28 earthquake struck with a magnitude of 8.6 on an adjacent portion of the plate boundary to the southeast. This was not an aftershock, but a new rupture of an adjacent segment of the fault. Now, concern about additional earthquakes is focused on the next area to the southeast, which last failed in a great earthquake in 1833. Major earthquakes could occur not only on the thrust fault along the plate boundary, but also on a related fault system beneath the island of Sumatra. Faulting on that system involves horizontal shearing, similar to the San Andreas Fault.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "The Sumatra Fault runs right down the length of the island. Because it is close to major population centers, the seismic hazard is significant even for a smaller event," Lay said.<br>

<p>
  Major faults elsewhere in the world--in northern Turkey, for example--have experienced sequences of earthquakes moving progressively along a fault line.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "When one part of the fault slides, that loads up the adjacent region and transfers stress. So you have a heightened potential for earthquakes on the adjacent section. The concern is that something like that could happen in Sumatra," Lay said.<br>

<p>
  Scientists in the Laboratory for Adaptive Optics at UCSC are developing extraordinarily precise optical systems that will enable astronomers to capture images of planets far beyond our solar system and build the next generation of giant telescopes. On May 17, campus officials and distinguished visitors dedicated new facilities for the laboratory and celebrated its achievements.
</p>
<p>
  "The Laboratory for Adaptive Optics is a technological powerhouse for observational astronomy, harnessing complex technologies from a variety of disciplines to enable us to see the cosmos with greater precision and clarity," said UCSC Chancellor Denice D. Denton.
</p>
<p>
  Established in 2002 with a $9.1 million grant from the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, the Laboratory for Adaptive Optics (LAO) develops innovative instrumentation to apply adaptive optics technology in astronomy. Adaptive optics sharpens the vision of ground-based telescopes by removing the blurring effects of turbulence in the Earth's atmosphere.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "Adaptive optics is one of the most exciting developments in ground-based astronomy in the last decade. It is crucial to very important science being planned for existing large telescopes and absolutely essential to the next generation of giant telescopes," said Joseph Miller, director of UC Observatories/Lick Observatory (UCO/Lick), which oversees the LAO.<br>
</p>
<p>
  UCO/Lick already operates world-class technical facilities for astronomical instrumentation at UCSC, including an optical lab and shops, an engineering lab, and an advanced detector lab.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "Now we have added a major laboratory for advancing the technology of adaptive optics--the only such lab associated with a university in the United States. It gives us the ability to develop and test new experimental techniques and equipment here on campus. This is a dream come true for me," Miller said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The LAO began operations in temporary facilities at the Lick optical lab before moving to its current location on the ground floor of Thimann Laboratories. Renovation of the facilities in Thimann was just completed this month.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The lab occupies two rooms with controlled temperature and lighting conditions and a clean environment to protect sensitive equipment from contamination. The instrument tables where researchers conduct experiments float on a cushion of air to isolate them from vibrations. The facilities also include a Class 100 clean room where optical instruments can be built.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "The lab has all the precision optical measurement tools we need to test advanced adaptive optics systems," said LAO principal investigator Claire Max, a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "The techniques we are exploring are well beyond the current state of the art, so we need to be able to put these systems through their paces in the lab before we try to take them to a telescope," she said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Max is also the director of the Center for Adaptive Optics (CfAO), headquartered at UCSC and established in 1999 by the National Science Foundation. The CfAO focuses on the advancement of adaptive optics technology in both astronomy and vision science. The LAO complements CfAO, providing a testing ground for concepts developed by CfAO researchers, Max said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The lab also provides an opportunity for UCSC students, both undergraduates and graduate students, to get involved in practical astronomy and the development of astronomical instruments, said LAO director Don Gavel.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "It is an interdisciplinary effort, so it brings together faculty and students from different programs on campus," Gavel said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Much of the work in the LAO focuses on two major goals, known as extreme adaptive optics and multiconjugate adaptive optics. Extreme AO pushes the limits of adaptive optics in an effort to give astronomers the ability to see the dim light from a planet orbiting a bright star.
</p>
<p>
  Astronomers have discovered more than 100 planets outside our solar system (called extrasolar planets) by indirect methods that detect the gravitational tug of the planet on its parent star. To actually see an extrasolar planet, however, requires an adaptive optics system that can prevent scattered light from the parent star from obscuring the nearby planet.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Only one extrasolar planet has been photographed, and that planet orbits a brown dwarf, a "failed star" not nearly as bright as ordinary stars such as the Sun. Extreme AO aims to get images so sharp that a planet can be seen next to a star more than a billion times brighter than the planet.
</p>
<p>
  Astronomers could then analyze the light from the planet for clues to its composition and other properties.<br>
</p>
<p>
  An adaptive optics system precisely measures how light gets distorted as it passes through the Earth's turbulent atmosphere. The system then calculates the corrections needed to counteract that distortion, applies the corrections by bouncing the light gathered by the telescope off a deformable mirror, and repeats the whole process hundreds of times per second. The deformable mirror is a key component, constantly changing shape to counteract the blurring effects of the atmosphere.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The LAO is at the forefront of the development of deformable mirrors based on MEMS technology. MEMS, which stands for micro-electro-mechanical systems, is a revolutionary technology that uses silicon-based fabrication techniques (like those used to make computer chips) and micromachining to make integrated devices that combine sophisticated electronics with moving parts. The LAO has been testing a MEMS mirror with 1,000 actuators, tiny elements that move up and down to change the shape of the mirror, which is about the size of a postage stamp.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "For extreme AO, we need a deformable mirror that is very optically smooth. We've got a beautiful setup for testing these mirrors and they are getting better and better. We will soon begin testing one with 4,000 actuators on the mirror, which is what we think we need to build an extreme AO system," Max said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Multiconjugate AO aims to increase the field of view, or the size of the area that is corrected by the AO system. Current AO systems use a single point-source of light--either a bright star or an "artificial guide star" created by a laser--as a reference for measuring atmospheric blurring. The system can only apply corrections for a relatively small region around that reference point. But the field of view could be increased by using multiple laser guide stars, Gavel said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "With multiple guide stars, you can effectively do tomography of the atmosphere, similar to medical imaging techniques like CT scans, to extend adaptive optics over a wide field of view," he said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Future giant telescopes now in the planning stages will require this type of adaptive optics. But the complexity of the system increases considerably with the need to integrate measurements from multiple guide stars and coordinate multiple deformable mirrors.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "There are different methods for doing this, and we will be testing them to see which does better," Max said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  With its support for the LAO, the Moore Foundation has provided vital resources for researchers to advance the state of the art of adaptive optics, said Miller.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "This grant allows us to fully equip the lab and get it off to a great start, giving us time to make it self-sustaining," he said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  In addition to funding the LAO, the Moore Foundation has provided $35 million in grants for the design phase of a giant telescope project: the Thirty Meter Telescope, a joint undertaking of UCO/Lick, the California Institute of Technology, the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy, and the Association of Canadian Universities for Research in Astronomy.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Established in September 2000, the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation seeks to develop outcome-based projects that will improve the quality of life for future generations. The foundation has organized the majority of its grantmaking around large-scale initiatives in three areas of interest to the Moores: environmental conservation, science, and the San Francisco Bay Area.<br>

<p>
  UCSC professor Alan Richards, who in late 2004 briefed the American military's Central Command on the Middle East, will address the UCSC Foundation Forum on June 2.
</p>
<p>
  Richards will speak on "American Thinking About Violence in the Middle East" at the 4 p.m. lecture in the College Nine/College Ten Multipurpose Room. His talk will be followed by a question-and-answer session. The event is free and open to the public.
</p>
<p>
  There will be parking at the Barn Theater at the main entrance to campus, with shuttles running to and from the forum.<br>
</p>
<p>
  It was at the invitation of high-level military intelligence officers that Richards delivered two briefings and met with top Pentagon officials in December 2004 about sources of instability throughout the Middle East and beyond.<br>
  <br>
  Since before the war, Richards--a critic of current government policy in the Middle East--has taken every opportunity to share his expertise with military and government officials, briefing officers at the Army War College in Pennsylvania, the Naval War College in Rhode Island, members of the intelligence community in Washington, D.C., and many others.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Richards is a professor of environmental studies and economics. He was educated at Harvard University and the University of Wisconsin-Madison, where he studied political science, Middle Eastern studies, and economics.
</p>
<p>
  He joined the Economics Department at UCSC in 1976 and transferred to the Environmental Studies Department in 2000.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The UC Santa Cruz Foundation Forum brings together UCSC Foundation trustees, faculty, students, and the Santa Cruz community to hear engaging speakers and participate in discussions on current subjects that affect their common interests and goals. The lecture series, inaugurated in 2002, is sponsored by the Office of the Chancellor and the UCSC Foundation.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  The Jewish Studies Program will present a lecture by Avivah Gottlieb Zornberg, titled "Seduced into Eden: The Beginning of Desire," on Wednesday, May 25, at Stevenson College Room 150 from 7 to 9 p.m. The lecture is free and open to the public.
</p>
<p>
  Zornberg's first book, <i>Genesis: The Beginning of Desire</i> (published by Doubleday), won the National Jewish Book Award for nonfiction in 1995, and Zornberg appeared on Bill Moyers's PBS program <i>Genesis: A Living Conversation</i>. Her most recent book, <i>The Particulars of Rapture: Reflections on Exodus</i>, was also published by Doubleday in 2001.
</p>
<p>
  Zornberg holds a Ph.D. in English literature from Cambridge University, studied at Gateshead Seminary and the Jerusalem Michlala, and taught English literature at the Hebrew University from 1969 to 1976. She brings classical Jewish biblical study and commentary into dialogue with contemporary critical theory and psychoanalytic perspectives. Working with literary and religious materials, she lectures and teaches a wide range of courses in Israel, England, and the United States.

<p>
  It's time once again for the annual Strawberry Shortcake Festival at the UCSC Farm. This year's gathering will take place Wednesday, May 25, from 4 to 6 p.m. A $5 donation will get you a huge serving of shortcake smothered in organic strawberries and freshly whipped cream, along with homemade lemonade or coffee from the Community Agroecology Network. After your treat, you'll want to enjoy a Farm tour and some homegrown bluegrass music. Sponsors of the festival include New Leaf Community Markets and Clover Stornetta Farms.
</p>
<p>
  Your donation supports low-income shares in the UCSC Farm's Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) program, which is celebrating its 10th anniversary this year.
</p>
<p>
  The CSA project makes fresh organic produce grown at the UCSC Farm available to households that invest directly in the Farm for an entire growing season. Every week from June through October, CSA members receive a share of the harvest, including organic fruits, vegetables, flowers, and herbs you can pick yourself in the CSA garden. The CSA is a mutually beneficial collaboration between the community and the Farm.
</p>
<p>
  If you would like to join the CSA, shares are still available. Full shares cost $600 and typically feed four to six people for about $27/week. Smaller households are encouraged to team up and split a full share. Payment can be in full or in quarterly installments. Low-income shares are available for $300 each. Members pick up boxes weekly on either Tuesday or Friday at the CSA Barn on the UCSC Farm. Members also receive a weekly newsletter with recipes, farm updates, and a schedule of events; complimentary membership in the Friends of the Farm & Garden for one year; a 10 percent discount on plants at the Farm's spring and fall plant sales; quarterly issues of News & Notes; and two issues of <i>The Cultivar</i>.

<p>
  Campus police will be hosting a countywide day of stepped-up enforcement of traffic laws throughout campus on May 25.
</p>
<p>
  Dubbed "BADGES," for "Before Aggressive Drivers Get Everybody Stopped," the initiative will target pedestrians, drivers, and bicyclists, and include seat-belt violations and speeding. Police from neighboring jurisdictions, including the cities of Santa Cruz, Watsonville, Scotts Valley, and Capitola, as well as the California Highway Patrol, will participate in the stepped-up enforcement on the UCSC campus. Most of the officers will patrol on motorcyles.
</p>
<p>
  Additional information on campus police is available at the <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/police/">UCSC Police Department</a> web site.

        <title>CfAO celebrates partnership with Hartnell College</title>

<p>
  <a name="content" id="content"></a> BEGIN STORY
</p>
<p>
  An educational partnership between the Center for Adaptive Optics (CfAO) at UCSC and Hartnell College in Salinas is bringing advanced astronomy courses to Hartnell students and encouraging underrepresented students to pursue degrees in science and engineering.
</p>
<p>
  In a ceremony on May 13 at UCSC, Hartnell president Edward Valeau presented the President's Partnership of Excellence Award to CfAO director Claire Max. Hartnell's collaboration with the CfAO is funded by the NASA Curriculum Improvement Partnership Award (CIPA) program. When the NASA-CIPA program evaluated its grant recipients recently, Hartnell was the top performing institution and received a perfect score, Valeau said.
</p>
<p>
  Last summer, CfAO researchers worked with Hartnell astronomy instructor Andrew Newton to offer a summer short course in astronomy called "The Distant Universe." It was the most advanced astronomy course ever taught at Hartnell and allowed students to interact directly with researchers. The course will be offered again this summer.
</p>
<p>
  "Our goal is to excite the students and give them a sense of where to go with that excitement," said CfAO postdoctoral researcher Anne Metevier, who was the lead teacher.
</p>
<p>
  Two students who took the course last summer have been accepted into the CfAO's internship program this summer. This is an impressive achievement, as more than 70 students from across the country applied for just 9 internship openings, Metevier said.<br>

<p>
  Don Juan, the legendary Spanish rogue and seducer, did get around in his day. Now the Don is coming to UCSC when the Music Department presents Mozart's Italian-language opera <i>Don Giovanni</i>, beginning on June 2 in the Music Center Recital Hall.
</p>
<p>
  Considered by many to be Mozart's finest opera, <i>Don Giovanni</i> is a successful combination of comic and dramatic opera. The work begins as Don Giovanni is leaving the bedroom of his latest conquest and ends with his descent into hell.
</p>
<p>
  <i>Don Giovanni</i> features the artistic efforts of an array of participants in addition to student performers: music lecturer Brian Staufenbiel directs; music professor Nicole Paiement conducts the UCSC Orchestra; lighting design is by Sylvie Vray; scenic design is by Legend Theatrical; costume design is by Marti Kranak; and wigs and makeup are by Jeanne Hurd. The opera will be sung in Italian with English supertitles.
</p>
<p>
  John Dizikes, professor emeritus and author of <i>Opera in America,</i> will present a preperformance talk before the final matinee performance on Sunday, June 5. The talk begins at 1:10 p.m. in the Music Center Recital Hall.
</p>
<p>
  <i>Don Giovanni</i> plays Thursday through Sunday, June 2-5 in the Music Center Recital Hall. Thursday, Friday, and Saturday performances are at 7:30 p.m.; Sunday's performance is at 2 p.m. Tickets are $18 general, $14 seniors, and $10 students. Seating is reserved. Tickets for the performance and the Dizikes talk are on sale at the UCSC Ticket Office (831) 459-2159.

        <title>Sociology hosts Lionel Cantu Memorial Colloquium May 24</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 23 May 2005 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>5829</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  The campus community is invited to attend the annual Lionel Cantu Memorial Colloquium on Tuesday, May 24, at 4 p.m. in the College Eight Red Room. The event will be followed by a reception at 5:30 p.m.
</p>
<p>
  This year's featured guest is Mattie Richardson, a doctoral candidate in African American studies at UC Berkeley. Richardson is the recipient of the UC Office of the President's 2005-06 Lionel Cantu Postdoctoral Fellowship. Her talk is entitled "Listening to the Archives: Black Lesbian Literature and Film."
</p>
<p>
  The colloquium honors the memory of Cantu, an assistant professor of sociology who died unexpectedly in 2002. At UCSC, the Lionel Cantu Memorial Award Fund was established to support a campus graduate student who is pursuing studies in one or more of the areas in which Cantu worked: immigration studies, transnational/cross-border studies, Latino/Latina sociology, gender and sexuality, or gay men and masculinity. This year's recipient of the $500 award will be announced at the colloquium. The selection committee was made up of sociology professor Candace West, anthropology professor Olga Najera-Ramirez, Latin American and Latino studies professor Patricia Zavella, and sociology graduate student Sarita Gaytan.
</p>
<p>
  In addition, the gathering will recognize the accomplishments of graduating seniors in sociology, including Jennifer Meissonnier, who was awarded the Dean's Undergraduate Award and a Chancellor's Award for her thesis, and Kara Deyhle, who has received a $10,000 public service award from the Donald A. Strauss Scholarship Foundation.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  In a joyful rite of spring, UCSC has selected 12 regional community college students who will receive $20,000 scholarships to enroll at the university this fall.
</p>
<p>
  This year's recipients of the Karl S. Pister Leadership Opportunity Awards include single parents, immigrants from Mexico and Vietnam, and re-entry students.
</p>
<p>
  The awards recognize talented students who have overcome adverse socioeconomic circumstances, have a demonstrated commitment to assisting and improving the lives of others, and who might not otherwise be able to attend UCSC for financial reasons. Recipients receive $10,000 scholarships for each of two years, as well as the support of a strong academic mentoring program and assistance finding summer work experience in a field that complements their studies.
</p>
<p>
  "This scholarship program opens doors to some of the most academically talented and determined students who enroll at UCSC each year, and I am proud to welcome them to our campus," said UCSC Chancellor Denice D. Denton. "Their contributions enrich our student community, and their achievements inspire us all."
</p>
<p>
  The presidents of 13 regional community colleges each nominate several students, and recipients are selected by Denton in consultation with the Leadership Opportunity Awards Screening Committee. The program was established in 1993 by former UCSC Chancellor Karl S. Pister to foster the transfer of accomplished community college students to UCSC.
</p>
<p>
  A list of this year's recipients follows, with hometowns and college affiliations. Biographical information about each recipient is also available below. For more information about the scholarship program or any of the recipients, call the UCSC Public Information Office at (831) 459-2495.

  "Al Young is a poet, an educator and a man with a passion for the arts," Schwarzenegger said. "His remarkable talent and sense of mission to bring poetry into the lives of Californians is an inspiration."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Young, 65, was born in Mississippi and began publishing poems, stories, and articles in his early teens. Young has lived most of his life in the San Francisco Bay Area, and has taught poetry and fiction writing at a number of universities, including UCSC, UC Berkeley, UC Davis, and Stanford.<br>
</p>
<p>
  In his first affiliation with UCSC, in 1983-84, Young worked with students in a number of courses, including an early course entitled <i>Writing About Community,</i> in affiliation with what would become the Community Studies Department.<br>
</p>
<p>
  As a visiting associate professor affiliated with the Literature Department in the mid- to late-1980s, Young taught such courses as advanced writing, screenwriting, and the American short story.<br>
</p>
<p>
  A lecturer in literature (creative writing) in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Young continued to mentor UCSC students, teaching courses in fiction, screenwriting, and advanced writing. During those years, he also taught a course titled <i>Art and Trash,</i> comparing the works of the greats of American literature to those produced by commercially successful contemporary writers.<br>
</p>
<p>
  As a result of the 2001 state legislation, the California Arts Council solicited nominations from literary groups, public and private arts organizations, literary critics, and universities for the position. A panel of literary professionals subsequently reviewed the candidates, and the names of four nominees, including Young's, were submitted to the governor for consideration.<br>

        <title>Students voting whether to raise fees for events center, other projects</title>

        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  Three major campus building projects, including a new multipurpose events center that could seat up to 4,000 people, are on the ballot as students vote this week on whether to increase their fees.
</p>
<p>
  The events center--the most expensive project on the ballot--would require a fee increase of $175 per quarter. Concerts, graduations, athletic competitions, theater performances, and large speeches and rallies are among events that could be held in the new space, which would be built on the south side of the Wellness Center.<br>
</p>
<p>
  If approved, the events center--with an estimated price tag of $61 million--would be the largest project ever authorized by students at UCSC. It would fill a major gap in campus student life facilities, said Gail Heit, associate vice chancellor of Student Affairs. "There is no indoor venue where a substantial number of students can come together," she said. "I was amazed--most community colleges and literally all the CSU campuses have student life and recreation facilities that exceed what we have at UCSC. As for a comparision with our sister UC campuses--well, even if all of these referenda passed--we would still be light-years behind."
</p>
<p>
  Students would not begin paying additional fees for projects until the construction is completed.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Other referenda on the spring ballot include:<br>
</p>
<p>
  * A multiuse outdoor/soccer/field sports venue ($45 per quarter), with a lighted field and seating and amenities for up to 2,000 spectators. It would be primarily for soccer, field sports, and other special events.<br>
</p>
<p>
  * Renovations and expansion of the Student Health Center ($27 per quarter) to modernize the dated and inefficient clinical space to accommodate the increase in student population since the center was built in 1969.<br>
</p>
<p>
  * Additional funding for UCSC'S NCAA Division III teams, intercollegiate clubs, and intramural sports and events ($24 per quarter).<br>
</p>
<p>
  Dan Wood, executive director of student activities, is working with a large student committee that formed to promote the events center, additional sports funding, and outdoor soccer venue.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "These three projects have something for every individual on campus," he said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  If the fee measure for the Health Center is approved, the building layout would be changed to allow more patient privacy and overall efficiency, said director Les Elkind.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "The center needs to be updated in a serious way," Elkind said, noting that the current Health Center layout is that of a hospital rather than a modern campus health center.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The facilities-related fee proposals have been in the works for several years. Consultants hired in 2001 conducted focus groups, surveys, and planning sessions to see what student life facilities were needed.
</p>
<p>
  The consultants came up with several recommendations, including a student union and renovation of the Quarry Amphitheater, Heit said. Fee increases and budget cuts in the intervening years delayed moving the recommendations forward, but student interest revived some of the proposals in time for the 2005 elections.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "For each of the facilities fee measures, more than 10 percent of all currently enrolled students signed petitions to put the measures on the spring ballot," Heit said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Student Union Assembly candidates and several smaller fee increases are also on the ballot, which will be conducted online from May 17 through May 23.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Detailed information on each measure is available on the campus elections web site at <a href="http://elections.ucsc.edu/elections05/ballot.html">elections.ucsc.edu/elections05/ballot.html</a><br>

        <title>Academic Senate faces 'full agenda' at May 20 meeting</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 16 May 2005 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>5821</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  <i>UCSC's Academic Senate will hold its spring meeting at 2:30 p.m. on Friday, May 20, in the College Nine/College Ten Multipurpose Room. Alison Galloway, Academic Senate Chair, has addressed the following letter to members of the Senate outlining issues on the agenda.</i><br>
</p>
<p>
  Dear Colleagues,<br>
</p>
<p>
  After an eventful spring, we are facing our final Senate meeting of the year with a <a href="http://senate.ucsc.edu/meetings/05May/A05may.htm">full agenda</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The meeting will be held in the Colleges Nine and Ten Multipurpose Room at the University Center and begins at 2:30 pm. As usual, for the end of the year, the meeting will also be followed by a reception, this time at University House.<br>
</p>
<p>
  In addition to the votes on the slate of committee members and officers for next year and the Faculty Research Lecturer, we have additional bylaw amendments and resolutions that will require action. We will also be hearing from Chancellor Denton, Interim CPEVC Kliger, and the Student Union Assembly and Graduate Student Assembly representatives.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Among the issues coming to the floor are changes in the undergraduate student grievance procedures. These changes necessitate a change in Santa Cruz bylaw 13.17.8. The Committee on the Education Abroad Program is presenting a mission statement for the Catalog and requesting Senate approval. The Committee on the Library is presenting a resolution on scholarly publishing. Finally, the Senate Executive Committee is presenting a resolution linking the need for affordable faculty housing to the plans for campus growth.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Several committees have reports on issues of concern to the campus.
</p>
<p>
  The Committee on Educational Policy has spent much of the year reviewing the quantitative courses within the general education requirement. Their interim report is presented for the meeting and their work will continue through the coming year.
</p>
<p>
  The Committee on Faculty Welfare presents a follow-up to their winter meeting oral report with new information and issues on Ranchview Terrace and future building possibilities.
</p>
<p>
  The Committee on Planning and Budget reports on outstanding issues arising from the Long Range Development Plan, including faculty housing, parking and transportation, and academic space. CPB recommends that 1) the Environmental Impact Report must show means of achieving a workable solution to these issues before the campus growth passes the present limit and 2) annual growth must be limited by the corresponding accumulation of the support in housing, space and infrastructure.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, as Senate Chair, I am forming a task force to investigate the events leading to the confrontation at Tent University, Santa Cruz on April 18, 2005. This group is designed to provide an impartial look at the decision-making processes on many sides and provide recommendations on how we can work to improve the emergency response approach to this type of event. A short period for discussion will be available on this topic.<br>
</p>
<p>
  If you have corrections for the minutes, please send them via email to the Senate Office before the meeting.<br>
</p>
<p align="right">
  Sincerely,<br>
  <br>
  Alison Galloway, Chair<br>
  Academic Senate<br>
  Santa Cruz Division<br>
</p>

        <title>New book by dance professor Mark Franko</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 16 May 2005 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_5819" align="alignright" width="200"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/05/franko_bookcover.200.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-5819" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/05/franko_bookcover.200.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="286" /></a>[/caption]
<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  In his new book, <i>Excursion for Miracles: Paul Sanasardo, Donya Feuer, and Studio for Dance,</i> theater arts professor Mark Franko reexamines the overlooked early choreographic achievements of Sanasardo and Feuer, whose Studio for Dance in New York City was a bastion of early postmodern dance in the 1950s and a precursor for the radical changes in art and thought of the 1960s.
</p>
<p>
  A dancer with the company for five years (1964-1969), Franko delivers a firsthand account of his experiences, combining personal anecdotes with an extensive knowledge of ethnography, critical theory, and dance history. His perspective contains both a dance scholar's theoretical expertise and the visceral recollections of a dancer emotionally connected to a body of work. Seventy-five black-and-white photographs accompany the text.
</p>
<p>
  Franko has presented his work internationally since 1985 with his company NovAntiqua. He is also the author of <i>The Work of Dance: Labor, Movement, and Identity in the 1930s, Dancing Modernism/Performing Politics, Dance as Text: Ideologies of the Baroque Body, The Dancing Body in Renaissance Choreography,</i> and coeditor of <i>Acting on the Past: Historical Performance Across the Disciplines</i>.

        <title>Music and stargazing entice summer visitors to Mt. Hamilton's Lick Observatory</title>

<p>
  UC's Lick Observatory offers its 25th season of evening programs for music lovers and astronomy buffs this summer, featuring concerts, lectures, and opportunities to view the night sky through the observatory's history-making telescopes atop Mt. Hamilton.
</p>
<p>
  Tickets go on sale this week for two series of public events: the Music of the Spheres concert series and the Summer Visitors Program.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Music of the Spheres is a benefit summer concert series whose proceeds support the UC Observatories/Lick Observatory (UCO/Lick), a multicampus research unit headquartered at UCSC that serves over 100 UC astronomers.
</p>
<p>
  Each of the six Music of the Spheres evenings combines a performance by world-acclaimed musicians and a lecture by a renowned astronomy researcher.
</p>
<p>
  Afterward, audience members take turns at the historic Lick Telescope, a 36-inch refractor that has been in operation since 1888 and remains the second largest refracting telescope ever built.
</p>
<p>
  A cadre of well-trained volunteers assist in these events by sharing their own telescopes and expertise with interested members of the audience.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Music of the Spheres concerts will take place on June 24 and 25, July 29 and 30, and August 26 and 27. For details on each concert, visit the <a href="http://www.ucolick.org/public/music.html">Lick Observatory web site</a>.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Tickets for each Music of the Spheres evening are offered at three levels: standard ($40), preferred ($100), and VIP ($150). All tickets include the concert, astronomy talk, viewing session through the 36-inch telescope, and a commemorative wineglass or coffee cup. Preferred ticket holders have the additional benefits of reserved seating and a 20 percent discount at the gift shop. A VIP ticket further entitles visitors to a private tour of the 120-inch Shane reflecting telescope and a light buffet.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Tickets for Music of the Spheres can be purchased from the UCSC Ticket Office at (831) 459-2159. Preferred and VIP tickets will be available starting May 17 and standard tickets starting May 20. For additional information, visit the <a href="http://events.ucsc.edu/tickets">Ticket Office web site</a>.<br>

  The Summer Visitors Program gives the public access to both the 36-inch Lick Telescope and the 40-inch Anna Nickel Reflector, a telescope scientists currently use to spot planets outside the solar system. As with the Music of the Spheres events, amateur astronomer volunteers provide additional outside viewing and informal talks. Each program also features two speakers to ensure an interesting evening even if bad weather prevents stargazing. The lectures include a history of Lick Observatory and multimedia presentations by Lick astronomers.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Dates for the Summer Visitors Program are July 15 and 16 at 8:30 p.m., August 12 and 13 at 8 p.m., and September 9 and 10 at 7:30 p.m. Tickets are $5 and will be made available through a lottery system, with a limit of four tickets per request. Ticket requests can be made from May 16 through May 29 using an online form (which will be available for those two weeks at <a href="http://www.ucolick.org/public/svp">http://www.ucolick.org/public/svp)</a> or by mail (SVP, PO Box 85, Mount Hamilton, CA 95140). Additional information about the program, as well as directions and maps, is <a href="http://www.ucolick.org/public/sumvispro.html">available online.</a><br>
</p>
<p>
  An added attraction this year is an exhibit of paintings by acclaimed artist Chesley Bonestell. The Bonestell exhibit, held in Lick Observatory's Main Building, commemorates the hundredth anniversary of the event that spurred Bonestell's interest in space art. Bonestell attended the Summer Visitors Program in 1905 and was most impressed with a view of Saturn through the Clark 12-inch refractor, which occupied the dome that now houses the Nickel 40-inch reflector. He painted a picture of Saturn as soon as he got home, and went on to produce a wide variety of astronomical paintings that have in turn inspired many astronomers' careers. Bonestell's works will remain on display at Lick Observatory through spring 2006.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Lick Observatory is located on the summit of Mt. Hamilton in the Diablo Range east of San Jose. Driving time from San Jose is about one hour via Mt. Hamilton Road (Route 130). Founded in 1888, Lick Observatory remains among the most productive research observatories in the world.<br>

<p>
  <i>Paracritical Hinge,</i> a new book by UCSC literature professor Nathaniel Mackey, offers commentary on the work of a number of artists as it simultaneously sheds light on the author's own body of work.
</p>
<p>
  A collection of essays, talks, notes, and interviews covering a time frame from 1990 to 2000, the diverse, yet interrelated pieces underscore Mackey's versatile work as a writer and critic.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The 18 selections in the book run the gamut from critical essays on poet Walt Whitman's interest in phrenology and Robert Duncan's Vietnam-era war poems, to written adaptations of talks Mackey gave about Miles Davis's trumpet sound and the influence of Spanish poet Federico Garcia Lorca on American poetry, focusing on Lorca's concept of <i>"duende,"</i> a prized element in flamenco singing.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The collection, published by the University of Wisconsin Press, also includes six interviews with Mackey that appeared in such publications as the <i>Chicago Review</i> and <i>Poetry Flash,</i> as well as a piece about editing the literary journal <i>Hambone.</i><br>
</p>
<p>
  "It's a book that reflects the fact that I function not only as a literary critic, but also as a poet, fiction writer, and editor of a literary magazine," Mackey noted. <i>"Paracritical Hinge</i> seemed like a good title for the book because it reflects a figurative hinge on a door that permits a flow between criticism and fiction, art and commentary--the practices I engage in," he added.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The book includes an essay Mackey wrote about a CD of poetry titled <i>Strick</i> that he recorded along with two jazz musicians in 1994 for the Spoken Engine record label in Memphis. "I was asked by the editor of an anthology of essays to write something about poetry performance," Mackey said. "It talks about some of my attitudes toward performance and the process of collaboration."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Mackey is the author of five chapbooks of poetry, one previous book of literary criticism, and three books of poetry. He has also completed three novels in a series titled <i>From a Broken Bottle Traces of Perfume Still Emanate</i>--composed as letters written by a composer/multi-instrumentalist named N, a founding member of a band known as the Mystic Horn Society.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Mackey's 1985 poetry book, <i>Eroding Witness,</i> was selected for publication in the National Poetry Series. He received a Whiting Writer's Award in 1993 and was elected to the Board of Chancellors of the Academy of American Poets in 2001.<br>

        <title>Seat-belt enforcement to be stepped up</title>

<p>
  Drivers and passengers will get extra reminders to buckle up from May 16 through June 5, courtesy of the UCSC Police.
</p>
<p>
  <img align="right" height="98" src="../art/seatbelt.88.jpg" width="88" alt="">UCSC's officers are joining local and state police in the nationwide "Click it or Ticket" campaign administered by the National Highway Traffic Safety campaign.
</p>
<p>
  A random sampling of vehicles will be checked randomly before and after the campus enforcement effort to see if compliance has increased; a two percent boost in seat-belt usage is the goal.
</p>
<p>
  Tickets for a first offense seat-belt violation in Santa Cruz County are $101, with much higher fines if a vehicle is pulled over and a passenger under age 16 is unbuckled or improperly buckled.

On Friday, May 20, Schneider will give a talk and show slides of her experience as a participant in the Coastal Challenge Costa Rica adventure race. The presentation will be from 7 to 9 p.m. in Classroom Unit 1.
</p>
<p>
  <img align="right" height="184" src="../art/coastal_challenge.150.jpg" width="150" alt="">Schneider will take the audience on an epic adventure while inspiring the audience to embrace challenge as it appears in their own lives. Among the themes of her talk are the power of team, the virtues of risk, adapt or fail, and reach beyond potential. Schneider has given presentations on these themes to industry leaders at WalMart, Seagate Technology, Tyson Foods, and Cisco Systems.
</p>
<p>
  The event includes music and raffle prizes, and there will be signed copies for sale of the book <i><a href="http://www.terrischneider.net/books/html/books.html">The Thrill of Victory, the Agony of My Feet</a></i>, which includes a chapter about Schneider.
</p>
<p>
  The cost is $5 for students, $8 general. Proceeds benefit the UCSC Recreation Program. The slide show is sponsored by OPERS, the Women's Center, Spokesman Bicycles, Fleet Feet Sports, World Gym, and Montrail.

        <title>UCSC Extension offers discounts, simplified enrollment for faculty and staff</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 16 May 2005 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>

<p>
  UCSC Extension offers UCSC staff and faculty a discount of 30 percent on the enrollment fee for any course in its catalog. And now the process of enrolling in classes has been simplified. In the past, to access the discount (up to $150 for one class), employees had to have a form signed by their supervisor and the campus Training and Development Office. Now the employee enrolls directly with Extension, and Extension verifies and enrolls. Download the <a href="http://www.ucsc-extension.edu/ucsc/generalInfo/enrollment/campus.jsp">enrollment form</a> (pdf format).
</p>
<p>
  UCSC Extension offers a wide range of courses in fields such as biotechnology, databases and software, health care, interior design, networking and security, business and management, art, and personal growth. Courses are held both in Santa Cruz and Cupertino. For a complete listing of Extension's courses, go to <a href="http://www.ucsc-extension.edu">www.ucsc-extension.edu</a>.<br>

<p>
  Chancellor Denice D. Denton underscored her appreciation of university staff at the annual Staff Appreciation Breakfast last week by pledging to continue the special awards program begun four years ago.
</p>
<p>
  Employees will receive a $210 bonus for their "continued dedication and hard work," announced Denton. The award will appear in June 8 checks after "noticing obligations" for represented employees are met, she said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Denton greeted many employees as they arrived at the breakfast, held at the Stevenson Event Center, and she thanked them for their commitment and enthusiasm during brief remarks.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "I really want to thank every one of you for the great work you're doing," said Denton, adding that the university would not be able to fulfill its mission of service to students without the dedication of staff. She acknowledged the "good feedback and ideas" she's received from members of the UCSC Staff Advisory Board (SAB), which sponsors the annual breakfast, and presented each outgoing SAB member with a Chancellor's Service Award.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Denton sparked a round of warm applause for Dining Services staff, who arrived before dawn to prepare the buffet of eggs, tofu scramble, pancakes, potatoes, bacon, sausage, pastries, doughnuts, and fresh fruit. " It's not easy to feed 1,100 people," she said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Dozens of raffle prizes were awarded, including gift certificates to Macy's, Bay Tree Bookstore, Circuit City, O'mei, Trader Joe's, Well Within, Gabriella Cafe, Olitas Cantina & Grille, the Crow's Nest, and Bittersweet Bistro. Many local businesses and campus administrators, including Denton, contributed prizes to the raffle.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The band Split Shift, made up entirely of UCSC employees, performed rock and blues for the crowd, which spilled over to the patio. Three of the five musicians work in Transportation and Parking Services: vocalist Carolyn Stark, drummer Tracy Freeman, and keyboardist David Ford. In addition, Patrick North of the Registrar's Office played bass, and guitarist Bob Oberg of Information Technology Services made his debut with the band, which has been performing at weddings and private parties for about four years.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Funded by the Award and Recognition Program, bonuses will be distributed to employees with career, partial-year career, by-agreement, and limited appointments. Awards will be proportionate to each staffer's appointment percentage time in effect on May 1, 2005. Employees with academic, student, or senior management appointments are excluded.<br>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_5794" align="alignright" width="150"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/05/kraft_robert.150.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-5794" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/05/kraft_robert.150.jpg" alt="Robert Kraft UCSC Photo Services" width="150" height="217" /></a>Robert Kraft UCSC Photo Services[/caption]

<p>
  The Astronomical Society of the Pacific has awarded the 2005 Catherine Wolfe Bruce Gold Medal to Robert P. Kraft, professor emeritus of astronomy and astrophysics and former director of the UC Observatories/Lick Observatory (UCO/Lick). Kraft is the sixth astronomer associated with the Lick Observatory to receive this award, and the fourth associated with UCSC.
</p>
<p>
  The Bruce Medal is the highest honor bestowed by the Astronomical Society of the Pacific (ASP). It recognizes scientists worldwide for fundamental and lifelong contributions to the field of astronomy. Previous recipients include many renowned astronomers, such as 1938 medalist Edwin P. Hubble, who showed the universe is expanding, and 2003 medalist Vera Rubin, who demonstrated the existence of dark matter.
</p>
<p>
  Kraft has received many awards in his long and distinguished career, but he said the Bruce Medal holds special significance. "The Bruce Medal I cherish the most since it has the longest history and is given on a worldwide basis," Kraft said. "The list of recipients contains a lot of my heroes, such as Otto Struve and Jesse Greenstein, and I feel really honored to be on that list."
</p>
<p>
  In announcing the award, the ASP acknowledged Kraft's outstanding research achievements and extensive service to the astronomy community.
</p>
<p>
  Kraft served as director of UCO/Lick from 1981 to 1991. During this time he played a key role in bringing about the W. M. Keck Observatory on Mauna Kea, Hawaii, by committing the resources of Lick Observatory to the construction and instrumentation of the world's first 10-meter telescope, now known as Keck I. Keck I and its twin, Keck II, remain the largest optical and infrared telescopes ever built. UCO/Lick operates the Keck Observatory in cooperation with Caltech and NASA.
</p>
<p>
  Kraft also served as president of the American Astronomical Society from 1974 to 1976 and president of the International Astronomical Union from 1997 to 2000.
</p>
<p>
  As a researcher, Kraft made important contributions to the understanding of novae, stars that undergo a sudden increase in brightness due to massive nuclear explosions. He showed that all novae arise from close binary star systems in which the more evolved star (usually a white dwarf) siphons up hydrogen and helium from its expanding companion. The transferred material forms a disk whose rapid accretion onto the dense white dwarf leads to an explosion. Kraft also established an important rung on the ladder of celestial distances by assessing the contribution of interstellar dust to the dimming of Cepheid variables in the disk of our galaxy. His work on stellar rotation--now a fundamental topic in astronomy textbooks--showed that stars like the Sun spin slower and slower as they age because winds of charged particles carry away their angular momentum.
</p>
<p>
  Kraft became interested in the chemical composition of stars after observing an unusual star named FG Sagittae, which underwent rapid changes in composition and later nearly disappeared behind a cloud of its own soot. He went on to analyze in detail the chemical composition of the oldest stars in our galaxy. This work led to several major contributions, including evidence for deep mixing of elements in red giants, bloated stars at a late stage of their evolution. He also established intriguing differences between the chemical composition of stars in globular clusters and their neighboring field stars.
</p>
<p>
  Kraft, 77, earned his B.S. and M.S. in mathematics from the University of Washington and his Ph.D. in astronomy from UC Berkeley. He rose to prominence in the 1960s as an astronomer at the Mt. Wilson and Palomar Observatories in Pasadena. He joined UC Santa Cruz in 1967 as an astronomer at Lick Observatory and professor of astronomy and astrophysics, after holding assistant professor positions at Indiana University and the University of Chicago.
</p>
<p>
  Soon after joining UC Santa Cruz, Kraft was elected to both the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1995, the American Astronomical Society named Kraft the Henry Norris Russell Lecturer for his lifetime achievement in astronomy. Kraft's work currently focuses on the abundance of rare earth elements in globular clusters.
</p>
<p>
  The Astronomical Society of the Pacific was founded in San Francisco in 1889 and has awarded the Catherine Wolfe Bruce Gold Medal most years since 1898. From the outset, the medal was meant for astronomers of any nationality and either gender, and might only be awarded when a suitable candidate was found. The ASP board of directors selects a medalist among candidates nominated each year by the directors of six observatories--three in the United States and three elsewhere in the world.

<p>
  A study comparing the nutritional demands of killer whales with the caloric content of their prey has startling implications for the potential impact of these large predators on populations of other marine mammals.
</p>
<p>
  The study also raises issues relevant to the establishment of marine reserves and efforts to reintroduce large predators into terrestrial ecosystems, said Terrie Williams, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Williams and her coauthors at UCSC and the University of Alaska published their findings in the December issue of the journal <i>Ecology.</i>
</p>
<p>
  Their analysis suggests that as few as 40 killer whales preying on Steller sea lions along the coast of the Aleutian Islands could have caused the fivefold decline that has been recorded in that population since the early 1980s. Similarly, the more recent tenfold drop in sea otter numbers in the same area could be the feat of just one pod of four or five killer whales specializing in sea otter hunting.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "Our main finding is the magnitude of the appetite of the killer whales," Williams said. "Predators with such a large body size and high metabolic rate have high nutritional demands."<br>
</p>
<p>
  This study bolsters a hypothesis put forth by the authors in earlier papers that linked declining marine mammal populations in the Pacific Northeast to the decimation of the great whales by industrial whaling.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The story begins more than a decade ago when Williams's coauthor James Estes, adjunct professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UCSC, was trying to understand the rapid disappearance of sea otters in parts of the Aleutian Islands, a 1,200-mile archipelago west of the Alaska Peninsula. The first eyewitness reports of killer whale attacks on sea otters came in the 1990s, a time when the Aleutian sea otter population was declining by 25 percent each year. But in protected bays that were inaccessible to killer whales, Estes found the sea otter populations to be stable. He concluded that killer whale predation was driving the disappearance of the sea otters.<br>
</p>
<p>
  At the same time, researchers had been puzzling over the precipitous decline of Steller sea lions and harbor seals in the same region. They had first blamed overfishing by commercial fisheries, which would deprive seals and sea lions of their staple food. But they couldn't find evidence that the animals were dying of starvation, nor for that matter of any illness.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "After having seen what killer whales did to sea otters, it wasn't hard to imagine that they could do the same thing to seals and sea lions," Estes said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Looking at records of marine mammal counts dating back to the 1950s, coauthor Alan Springer of the University of Alaska in Fairbanks observed successive waves of population collapses. The sea otters' nosedive that began in the early 1990s came after similar trends had affected Steller sea lions in the late 1980s and harbor seals in the late 1970s. Before these declines, the 1960s had seen the decimation of the North Pacific great whales by commercial whaling.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The team proposed that killer whales had once fed primarily on great whales, until those large prey became too scarce to provide a steady food supply. The killer whales then redirected their hunting to progressively smaller animals.<br>
</p>
<p>
  But did the numbers add up? That is the question the researchers set out to answer in their latest paper.<br>
</p>
<p>
  It is difficult to evaluate the nutritional requirements of large predators, Williams said. Scientists know how much killer whales eat in captivity, but not when they are swimming and hunting in the open ocean. Direct measurements of killer whale diets in the wild were not feasible, but Williams and others have done extensive research on the physiology and nutritional needs of smaller marine mammals, such as dolphins and seals.
</p>
<p>
  Williams extrapolated from this work to estimate the caloric intake of the much larger killer whales. She calculated that an adult female, weighing approximately two tons, would need more than 190,000 kilocalories per day; a 4.5-ton male would need 290,000 kilocalories per day.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Adult sea otters weigh between 50 and 75 pounds, which represents, on average, 50,000 kilocalories. Depending on its size and the size of its prey, an adult killer whale could satisfy its appetite by gobbling up between 3 and 7 sea otters a day--or 1,095 to 2,555 otters per year.
</p>
<p>
  Williams estimated that the decline of sea otter numbers in the 1990s in the Aleutian Islands corresponded to the loss of approximately 10,000 adults per year. An average pod of killer whales (one adult male and four to five adult females) with a single-minded appetite could easily eliminate that many otters.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Biologists recognize at least two different types of killer whales in the northeastern Pacific Ocean. They differ in behavior, social structure, genetics, and diet. Most killer whales eat fish, but a small proportion--perhaps 10 to 17 percent--feeds primarily on marine mammals. A conservative estimate places the number of marine mammal-eating killer whales at around 170 in the Aleutian Islands waters, according to Williams and her colleagues. While no killer whale may care for a diet consisting exclusively of sea otters, each one of those 170 orcas would only have to eat one or two sea otters a week to cause the observed decline.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Compared with the lean sea otters, blubber-padded seals and sea lions have a high caloric content, so fewer are needed to feed a killer whale. Williams estimated that an average adult killer whale would be satiated on two to three Steller sea lion pups every day or one adult every two to three days.
</p>
<p>
  A predator population of 170 killer whales bent on a sea lion diet would remove 40,000 individuals from circulation each year, three times the number needed to drive the yearly rate of Steller sea lion decline observed since the 1980s.<br>
</p>
<p>
  By comparison, one great whale represents an enormous supply of calories. "You could feed 17 killer whales for a day on a single gray whale carcass," Williams said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Williams noted that she probably underestimated the potential impact of killer whales, because she didn't factor in the greater caloric requirements of pregnant females and growing juveniles. Her calculations do not prove that killer whales are responsible for the disappearance of smaller marine mammals, but they show that it is a definite possibility.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "It's really a feasibility study," Estes said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Over years of field observations in the Aleutian archipelago, Estes has found no evidence that sea lions or otters were starving, a common hypothesis to explain large population drops. On the other hand, there is a lot of historical and current evidence that killer whales attack and feed on large whales, he said. After the great whales declined, it would make sense for killer whales to turn to other kinds of prey.<br>
</p>
<p>
  In the Monterey Bay, reports of killer whale attacks on gray whales are common during the spring migration. The killer whales prey on juvenile gray whales as they migrate with their mothers from calving grounds in Baja California to feeding grounds in Alaska.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "What is remarkable is how quickly we could lose the sea otter population in the Monterey Bay if killer whales decided to change from hunting gray whale calves to feeding on otters. Theoretically, the otters would be gone in two months," Williams said.<br>
  <br>
  Switches in predatory behaviors are well documented among land animals, Williams said. Lions, for instance, may prefer wildebeests, but they will hunt small antelopes in the absence of larger prey, she said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "Many carnivores chose prey that make energetic sense," she said. "Rather than starve when preferred foods are gone, they may turn to the prey equivalent of rice cakes and popcorn."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Killer whales are resourceful, Estes said. Different groups of marine mammal-eating killer whales have different diets and hunting strategies, he said. Some specialize in seals, others in porpoises.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "A few animals learning to do something clever could have a lot of local impact," Estes said. "The implication for nature conservation is that whale populations should be allowed to recover. Gray whales may have completely recovered, but they are a very small part of the whole whale community."<br>
</p>
<p>
  The methods Williams and her colleagues used--demographic analyses and measurements of caloric value--have been around since the 1940s, she said. What's new is putting together physiology and demographics.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "It is amazing that we haven't made more use of these simple analyses," she said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Knowing the nutritional requirements of killer whales has important implications for the design of marine reserves. Williams drew a parallel with the reintroduction of wolves in Yellowstone. "We would like to re-create a natural ecosystem, but we need to do it with a realistic idea of what predators are going to need to survive," she said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  She is currently applying her approach to estimate the ecological impact of terrestrial predators, such as coyotes and mountain lions, on local ecosystems.<br>

<p>
  The National Academies Keck Futures Initiative has awarded a $50,000 grant for nanotechnology research to Holger Schmidt, assistant professor of electrical engineering.
</p>
<p>
  Schmidt will work with Xing Su, a collaborator based in Santa Clara, to develop a new type of sensor technology for medical and biological analysis.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The project is one of 14 to receive competitive seed grants this year from the National Academies Keck Futures Initiative for interdisciplinary research on nanoscience and nanotechnology. The initiative, funded by the W. M. Keck Foundation, aims to stimulate interdisciplinary research at the most exciting frontiers.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The new sensor technology envisioned by Schmidt and Su would enable the optical detection of specific molecules with single-molecule sensitivity using a compact chip-based device. Schmidt's lab has developed integrated optical waveguides with liquid cores, enabling light propagation through tiny volumes of liquids on a chip. Su works with composite nanoparticles that can be used to amplify optical signals through an effect known as surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). The researchers plan to combine the two technologies to create an "integrated biophotonic Raman sensor."<br>
</p>
<p>
  "The basic idea is that if you shine light on a molecule it will vibrate and scatter light in a way that is characteristic for each type of molecule. This scattered light is very weak, but if the molecules are bound to a nanoparticle, the optical signal is amplified enough to be detectable," Schmidt said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Su has developed a novel type of hybrid inorganic nanoparticles that produce large Raman scattering signals. Schmidt is also collaborating with Jin Zhang, professor of chemistry and biochemistry at UCSC, who is investigating other kinds of nanoparticles, such as silver aggregates.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "One nice thing about our approach is that it works with a variety of nanoparticles," Schmidt said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The standard apparatus for detecting SERS is a large Raman microscope set up on a laboratory benchtop. With Schmidt's liquid-core waveguides, however, the optical detection apparatus could be integrated into a silicon chip along with the necessary electronics. This approach could lead to low-cost, portable, and highly sensitive biophotonic sensor devices for identifying proteins and other biologically important molecules in small samples.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Schmidt said his collaboration with Su was the result of attending a conference held last year by the Futures Initiative, called "Designing Nanostructures at the Interface between Biomedical and Physical Systems."<br>
</p>
<p>
  "We wouldn't have met otherwise, so I really value this initiative, which is bringing together people from different disciplines to generate these new directions and ideas," Schmidt said.<br>

        <title>Prices increasing for new Ranch View Terrace houses</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 09 May 2005 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>5787</wp:post_id>

<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  Despite rising costs, interest remains strong for homes in the Ranch View Terrace development on campus.
</p>
<p>
  Construction on the three- and four-bedroom single-family homes for faculty and staff is scheduled to begin this summer.
</p>
<p>
  The first phase of the development is composed of 45 homes: 20 three-bedroom homes and 25 four-bedroom homes. It is scheduled for completion by fall 2006.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The three-bedroom homes, ranging from 1,747 to 1,905 square feet, will be priced from the high $400,000s to high $500,000s, and the four-bedroom homes, with 2,002 to 2,078 square feet, will sell from the mid-$500,000s to the low $600,000s. The prices have gone up about 25 percent from earlier estimates, said Faculty and Staff Housing manager Steve Houser.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "Construction costs have gone through the roof," Houser said, noting that the problem is not limited to UCSC. UC Irvine's new for-sale housing has experienced similar cost increases during the last year, he said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Despite the increases, the campus housing prices compare well against the $879,000 median price of single-family homes in Westside Santa Cruz during March, according to figures from a Multiple Listing Service data search. Faculty and Staff Housing will begin marketing to all eligible employees later this spring.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Houser said 160 employees on Faculty and Staff Housing Office waiting lists had initially indicated interest in the Ranch View Project. A survey of the employees is under way, but so far, of the 89 responses received, 69 are still interested in purchasing a home in Ranch View Terrace, he said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Construction of these homes could cause a ripple effect throughout campus housing.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "Many of the persons owning our existing stock at Hagar Court, Hagar Meadow, Laureate Court and Cardiff Terrace have expressed interest in larger units," Houser explained. "We think that many of these persons, who are on our waiting lists, will want to relocate to Ranch View, creating entry-level opportunities for others in existing housing."<br>
</p>
<p>
  The price range on UCSC's existing 132-unit housing stock is approximately $130,000 to $272,000 for 875- to 1,100-sqare-foot units.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "That being said, we are aware that there are households, especially single-income households, who will no longer be able to purchase at Ranch View due to the price increases," Houser said. "This is an unfortunate and undesired consequence of the increased costs of construction."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Additional phases of Ranch View Terrace--up to 84 homes total--will be constructed if it is determined there is sufficient demand, Houser said. The campus also owns 51 condominiums in Laureate Court that could be sold at a later date. The campus has already sold 13 Laureate Court condos, nine to staff members and four to faculty.<br>

<p>
  The Regional History Project at the University Library announces the publication of <i>Rita Bottoms, Polyartist Librarian, UC Santa Cruz: 1965-2003</i>. Project director Irene Reti conducted 14 hours of interviews with Rita Bottoms, former head of Special Collections at UCSC, shortly before Bottoms' retirement in March 2003. This oral history provides a vivid and intimate look at 37 years "behind the scenes" in the library's Special Collections.
</p>
<p>
  For nearly four decades, Bottoms immersed herself in collecting work by some of the most eminent writers and photographers of the 20th century, including the science fiction writer Robert Heinlein, photographer Edward Weston, composer John Cage, visual poet Kenneth Patchen, poet and letterpress book printer William Everson, poet and visual artist Lawrence Ferlinghetti, composer and poet Lou Harrison, singer and photographer Graham Nash, and philosopher Norman O. Brown.
</p>
<p>
  But Bottoms' role as a curator and librarian extended far beyond acquiring collections; she developed intense and profound intellectual and emotional relationships with each of these individuals. It is her detailed and deeply personal stories of these relationships that form the heart of this volume and provide the kind of human amplification of the library's collections that can only be captured through oral history. Bottoms' recollections of these individuals are an important contribution to the history of 20th-century art and literature in the United States.
</p>
<p>
  Photocopies of the volume can be ordered from the Regional History Project at (831) 459-2847 or via e-mail to <a href="mailto:ihreti@ucsc.edu">ihreti@ucsc.edu</a>. The volume is also available for viewing at Special Collections, McHenry Library, and at Bancroft Library, UC Berkeley, or can be checked out from the McHenry Library.<br>

<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  Catching a movie or play in another language isn't that unusual, but how about five productions and five different languages on the same night?
</p>
<p>
  Now in its fifth year, the International Playhouse does just that, performing its multilingual magic in Chinese, French, Japanese, Russian, and Spanish from May 19 to 22. English "supertitles" will be projected above the stage during each production.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "People really seem to enjoy it," said Miriam Ellis, a lecturer in French, who coordinates the International Playhouse. "It has something for everyone who knows even a smattering of one of these languages."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Sponsored by Cowell College and the Language Program at UCSC, the shows will be performed on May 19 and 20 at 8 p.m., and May 21 and 22 at 2 p.m., in the Stevenson Event Center at Stevenson College. Admission is free and the public is invited.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Language lecturers volunteer to direct the productions, which feature students in the UCSC Language Program, Ellis said. "This is really a labor of love."<br>
</p>
<p>
  The following works will be performed:<br>
</p>
<p>
  * <i>A Short Dramatic Piece: The Perfect Wife,</i> written and directed by Jackie Ku, lecturer in Chinese.<br>
</p>
<p>
  * <i>La Lacune</i> (The Gap) by Ionesco, directed by Ellis. When Ionesco visited the area in 1979, Ellis--then a graduate student--served as his guide and interpreter. "I have a special place in my heart for his works," she said.
</p>
<p>
  *<i>Shibiri</i> (Pins and Needles), directed by Sakae Fujita, lecturer in Japanese.<br>
</p>
<p>
  * <i>Dramatic Scenes by Daniil Kharms,</i> directed by William Nickell, lecturer in Russian.<br>
</p>
<p>
  * <i>El Retabillo de Don Cristobal</i> (Don Cristobal's Puppet Stage) by Lorca, directed by Paco Ramirez, lecturer in Spanish.<br>
</p>
<p>

        <title>UC College Prep Online expands to operate online charter schools</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 09 May 2005 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>

        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  Building on the success of its online college-prep programs, the University of California is gearing up to establish a UC Online Academy with three online charter schools slated to open in the fall of 2006.<br>
</p>
<p>
  <a href="http://www.uccp.org/">UC College Prep Online</a> (UCCP), based at UCSC, recently received a three-year $550,000 grant from the California Department of Education's Public Charter Schools Grant Program to develop online schools in Imperial, Mendocino, and Butte Counties.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The academy will provide access for independent learners and special needs students to a high-quality college preparation curriculum. Potential beneficiaries might include students in foster care or migrant families that move around, teen mothers, students in the court system, students engaged in competitive athletics or performing arts, and those who are hospitalized.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "The UC Online Academy is designed to meet the needs of students who are best-served by the flexibility of an online program. We know there are UC-potential kids out there whose needs are not being met," said Francisco J. Hernandez, vice chancellor of Student Affairs at UCSC.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The university will work with each County Office of Education to develop programs and share responsibilities. Educational programs will follow a standards-based online curriculum aligned to the state framework for high schools and the admission requirements of the University of California.
</p>
<p>
  Most activities will be conducted online, augmented by in-person physical education, academic research, and community service opportunities. The operation of charter schools establishes UCCP as a credit-granting entity that satisfies federal mandates of the "No Child Left Behind Act."<br>
</p>
<p>
  "UCCP will continue to offer supplemental services and online college-prep courses to schools with high enrollments of low-income and minority students. We have recently developed a new online algebra course that will serve the needs of many California students," said Hernandez.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Founded in 1999, UC College Prep Online (UCCP) was created in response to a state mandate to provide equity in access to rigorous curriculum. Historically, UCCP has offered courses that fill in the gaps where academic resources do not exist.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The UC Online Academy grant was approved by the State Board of Education with funding from the federal Public Charter Schools Grant Program. A $31.5 million package approved by state schools chief Jack O'Connell will help open 84 new charter schools in California, and help 11 existing high-quality charter schools share their best practices with other K-12 public schools. UC received $180,000 in start-up funds for each online charter school. California currently has more than 500 charter schools.<br>
  <br>

<p>
  Renowned astronomer Andrea Ghez will describe how she showed that our galaxy revolves around a supermassive black hole when she gives the annual Halliday Lecture at UCSC on Tuesday, May 17.
</p>
<p>
  Ghez's talk, "Unveiling a Supermassive Black Hole at the Center of Our Galaxy," will take place at 7:30 p.m. in the Media Theater on the UCSC campus. The event is free and open to the public.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Ghez is a professor of astronomy at UCLA and one of the world's leading observational astrophysicists. Her research focuses on the origin and early life of stars and planets, as well as the distribution and nature of the matter at the center of our galaxy. Her observations have helped to resolve an issue explored by astronomers over many decades--whether or not there is a black hole at the center of our own galaxy, the Milky Way.<br>
</p>
<p>
  From her measurements of the orbital dynamics of stars near the galactic center, Ghez demonstrated the existence of a central, dark concentration of mass with a density more than 10 million times larger than the largest earlier estimates. The only explanation consistent with these observations is the existence of a supermassive black hole, with a mass more than 4 million times that of the Sun.<br>
</p>
<p>
  A member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, Ghez is also affiliated with the Center for Adaptive Optics based at UCSC. Her lecture is being held in conjunction with the dedication of UCSC's Laboratory for Adaptive Optics, a new facility for developing innovative instrumentation for adaptive optics applications in astronomy.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Ghez has received numerous awards and honors, including the 2004 Sackler Prize in the Physical Sciences, the Newton Lacy Pierce and Annie J. Cannon Prizes of the American Astronomical Society, and the Maria Goeppert-Mayer award of the American Physical Society. She was named one of the top 20 scientists in the country under age 40 in <i>Discover</i> magazine's 20th anniversary issue.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The Halliday Lecture Series is sponsored by UCSC's Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics and the UC Observatories/Lick Observatory. It is made possible by the generous support of John Halliday, a trustee of the UC Santa Cruz Foundation, to promote public awareness and appreciation for astronomy and astrophysics.<br>
</p>
<p>
  For more information about this event, please call (831) 459-1438.<br>

<p>
  Winter and spring rains have produced both an abundant rose crop and challenging conditions for growers who want to avoid spraying fungicides and other chemicals on their plants. Alan Chadwick Garden manager and rose expert Orin Martin will share his techniques for choosing and growing roses without chemical inputs at a workshop on Saturday, May 14, from 10 am to 12 noon at the Alan Chadwick Garden.
</p>
<p>
  Martin will discuss the importance of selecting disease-resistant varieties, following an aggressive pruning program, and using organically acceptable sprays such as dormant oil to prevent diseases. He'll have an array of roses and rose books on hand for participants to survey, so bring a notebook to jot down information.
</p>
<p>
  The Chadwick Garden supports a collection of approximately 125 roses representing 10-15 classes and 75 varieties. Thanks to a grant from the Stanley Smith Horticultural Trust, the collection has expanded over the past season and now includes a rose demonstration area.
</p>
<p>
  Cost of the rose workshop is $10-$15 for members of the Friends of the UCSC Farm & Garden (sliding scale); $15 general admission, payable the day of the event. For more information, call (831) 459-3240. The workshop is cosponsored by the Center for Agroecology & Sustainable Food Systems and the Friends of the UCSC Farm & Garden.
</p>
<p>
  The main entrance to the Alan Chadwick Garden is located on McLaughlin Drive across from Stevenson College, where free parking will be available.

<p>
  Dana Priest, a reporter covering national security issues for the <i>Washington Post,</i> and an analyst and correspondent for NBC News, will give a talk on Monday, May 9, from noon to 1:30 p.m. at the Namaste Lounge at Colleges Nine and Ten. The title of her presentation is <i>"</i>America's Disappeared: The CIA and Human Rights After 9-11."
</p>
<p>
  Priest's book about the military's expanding responsibility and influence, <i>The Mission: Waging War and Keeping Peace With America's Military,</i> was published in 2003 by W. W. Norton & Co. It won the prestigious New York Public Library Bernstein Book Award and was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize.
</p>
<p>
  Priest, a UCSC alumna (Merrill '81), has worked at the <i>Post</i> for 18 years. She was the Pentagon correspondent for seven years and then wrote exclusively about the military as an investigative reporter. She covered the invasion of Panama (1989), reported from Iraq in late 1990 just before the war began, reported on the 1999 Kosovo war from air bases in Europe, on the Special Forces in Afghanistan in 2001, and with the secretary of defense in Iraq in 2003.
</p>
<p>
  She has written extensively about the military's four regional commanders, traveled widely with Army Special Forces in Asia, Africa, and South America, and reported with Army peacekeeping units deployed in Bosnia, Kosovo, and Afghanistan. Priest has written extensively on the intelligence lapses that led up to the attacks of September 11, the failure of prewar intelligence in Iraq, the government's covert war against suspected terrorists around the world, and the interrogation scandal at Abu Ghraib and elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
  In 2001, Priest was awarded a MacArthur Foundation Research and Writing grant and was a guest scholar in residence at the U.S. Institute of Peace. The same year, she won the Gerald R. Ford Prize for Distinguished Reporting on the National Defense for her series "The Proconsuls: A Four-Star Foreign Policy?" and the State Department's Excellence in Journalism Award for the same series. She was the guest speaker and host for a four-part speaking series on the U.S. Military and Foreign Policy for the State Department's "Secretary's Open Forum."
</p>
<p>
  Priest lives in Washington, D.C., with her husband and two children. She appears regularly on NBC's <i>Meet The Press, Hardball</i>, and MSNBC as well as contributing regularly to <i>NBC Nightly News</i>.<br>
  --------<br>
  This event is sponsored by CGIRS, the Global Information Internship Program, College Nine, and the Center for Justice, Tolerance and Community.

<p>
  The Second Annual KZSC Laugh Riot is bringing world-class comedy to Santa Cruz on Saturday, May 14, at 7 p.m. in the Kresge Town Hall.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The show will feature a broad spectrum of comedy from stand-up to music to sketch to film. The event, which is presented by KZSC, The Sound of Young America, and the SF Sketchfest, is a benefit for KZSC community radio. Tickets are $9 door/$8 in advance and students.<br>
  <br>
  Featured acts include:<br>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Hard N Phirm</b><br>
</p><i>Singled Out, Shipmates</i><i>Jimmy Kimmel Live</i><br>
<p>
  <b>Jasper Redd</b><br>
  In the past two years, Jasper Redd has earned a reputation as San Francisco's funniest young stand-up. The 25-year-old Tennessee native has traveled from janitorial roots to a full-time career on stage. He was recently featured on Comedy Central's <i>Premium Blend</i>, and his unique style has been featured at all three of the now-legendary 826 Valencia comedy benefits alongside performers like Greg Proops, Zach Galifianakis, Patton Oswalt, and Al Madrigal.<br>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Prank the Dean</b><br>
  Fifteen months ago, Prank the Dean were four disaffected Santa Cruz youths, most likely headed to juvenile delinquency and a life of petty crime. Today, they're the Bay Area's hottest new sketch comedy group. How did they do it? Hard work, discipline, and respect for their elders. Today they're proud to have been featured at the 2005 SF Sketchfest, where they were called "delightfully hilarious" by Pat Craig of the <i>Contra Costa Times</i>, and "hilarious from the start" by the <i>Stanford Daily</i>.<br>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Brent Weinbach</b><br>
</p><br>
<p>
  and your host... <b>Jordan Morris</b><br>
  UCSC graduate Jordan Morris has made his name by writing the kind of surprising, left-field jokes that are heard all too rarely in traditional comedy clubs. He's performed at clubs and alternative comedy rooms across the Southland, and is making his Bay Area debut.<br>

        <title>Study highlights the importance of writing skills for science students</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 02 May 2005 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  A survey by a group of UCSC researchers on the role of writing in undergraduate education in the sciences has turned up some interesting findings, which the researchers hope will prompt a serious and imaginative discussion of the importance of writing in the science curriculum.
</p>
<p>
  From interviews conducted with UCSC science faculty and students involved in senior research projects, the researchers found that both groups consider writing skills to be essential for success as a scientist. Yet explicit instruction in writing, including writing as a tool to help develop critical thinking, is mostly absent from the courses typically taken by science majors.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "Most students we interviewed said they learn to write about science by inference, and there is a real need for more explicit instruction in writing," said Nancy Cox-Konopelski, director of UCSC's Academic Excellence Program (ACE) and one of the principal investigators in the study.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "We are hoping that this study will help to open up a dialogue about how we can provide more opportunities for writing instruction to undergraduates in the sciences," she said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Cox-Konopelski teamed up with Donald Smith, professor and chair of environmental toxicology, and Donald Rothman and Virginia Draper, both lecturers in the Writing Program, to conduct the study. It was funded by a grant from the Consortium for High Academic Performance. The researchers gave a panel presentation of their findings in March at the Conference on College Composition and Communication sponsored by the National Council of Teachers of English (NCTE).<br>
</p>
<p>
  The study was motivated by a concern that poor writing skills may be a barrier limiting the entry of students into independent research paths or limiting their ability to complete their senior thesis.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "My experience is that a lot of students who do research projects get hung up right at the end when they start writing their thesis. I've encountered students who never finished their thesis because they hit this barrier," Smith said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Using a carefully constructed set of questions, the researchers conducted independent interviews with 22 students and nine faculty members in the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences. All of the students were seniors engaged in student research projects.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "Our hunch before we did the interviews was that the faculty would say writing is important, but not the students. In fact, everybody seems to recognize the importance of writing beyond just the need to communicate--they see it as a valuable tool for shaping their thinking and doing science," Smith said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  According to Rothman, many faculty recognize that writing can be a tool for developing critical thinking skills and that the process of writing forces one to think more clearly and creatively.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "I was impressed by the faculty who saw writing as a way of learning and talked about the intellectual skills that writing encourages," he said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  As one student put it, "The act of writing helped me understand what I was doing."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Both students and faculty agreed, however, that students need more guidance to develop their writing abilities. Faculty wish they could do more to teach writing, but they don't have the time and, more importantly, they are not sure how to do it, Rothman said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "What's frustrating is that the campus has people who can help--we have a group of professional writing faculty on campus. We just need to figure out how to use the resources we have more effectively," Rothman said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Currently, the faculty in UCSC's Writing Program teach mostly introductory writing courses for first-year students. When it comes time to write a senior thesis, however, many students find themselves on their own.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "The bottom line is we know we could do more just by having a coordinated effort to provide support and resources," Smith said. "Our study is a very preliminary assessment, but it gives us enough information to begin to understand what is working and what's not. This could serve as a starting point for addressing the need for more writing instruction linked to undergraduate research."<br>
</p>
<p>
  The researchers said they are eager to connect with other faculty on campus who are interested in this issue.<br>

  The <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/sab/">Staff Advisory Board</a> (SAB) is involved in a lot more than just the quarterly forums with the chancellor, board members told a forum on April 27.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Speaking at its first General Staff Forum at Stevenson Fireside Lounge, board members explained that the SAB provides advice and comment on topics that may affect staff to Chancellor Denice D. Denton and has two representatives on the systemwide Council of University of California Staff Assemblies. The SAB also sits on committees focusing on everything from housing to student fees and transportation.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "Chancellor Greenwood helped elevate the role of the Staff Advisory Board, and Chancellor Denton is continuing that tradition," said SAB chair Patt Takeuchi, who noted the SAB meets with the chancellor before each quarterly Staff Brown-Bag Forum.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The systemwide Council of Staff Assemblies played a key role in the appointment of two staff advisers to serve at the pleasure of the Regents on two regental committees: grounds and buildings, and education policy, for the 2005-06 academic year.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Members of the systemwide council "offer a staff perspective" at quarterly sessions involving leaders of different campuses and individual Regents throughout the UC system, said Ed Titus. Titus, UCSC's telecommunications manager, and Pamela Edwards, an administrative analyst in the Academic Senate Office, represent UCSC on the council.
</p>
<p>
  "You have an opportunity to talk to some very powerful people who make decisions for the campus," Titus said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Staff Advisory Board chair Patt Takeuchi called the council "a really incredible secret," noting that UCSC administrative analyst Rosemary Anderson will become chair of the statewide organization this summer.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Questions about the makeup of the Staff Advisory Board--and where employees represented by unions fit in--were among subjects raised by members of the audience at the forum.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Calling this a "thorny question," Titus said union-represented staff are not now allowed to sit on the Staff Advisory Board, though their input on SAB committees is welcome. The SAB is sponsored by the Chancellor's Office and serves at the pleasure of the UCSC chancellor, Titus said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "Our feeling is that this is a very limiting situation and one we don't like. We certainly want the perspective of represented people and do our best to represent them," he said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "We're trying to find ways that all staff can be included," added Takeuchi.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Others brought up issues of low pay and lack of raises.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Lisa Gustafson said a major problem is what she believes is a disparity in pay between UCSC and some other UC campuses. Gustafson is a payroll/personnel coordinator for University Dining Services and member of the Coalition of University Employees.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "I think we need to make a concerted effort to change this, because it's hurting all of us," she said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Titus noted that the SAB and the campuswide Council of Staff Assemblies are barred from any discussion of the terms and conditions of employment, "but we can share that pay issues are severely affecting morale."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Staff Advisory Board members encouraged audience members to become active on the board and its committees. The board is hosting or cohosting several events during spring quarter, Takeuchi said. A new event is the Volunteer Fair, showcasing volunteer opportunities both on and off campus for staff, students, and faculty. The fair will be held from noon to 2 p.m. May 3 at Quarry Plaza.

<p>
  Nearly 70 charter members of The Indus Entrepreneurs (TiE)--a Silicon Valley not-for-profit network of Indo-American and Indian entrepreneurs and professionals--were introduced to UCSC's research and achievements at a recent retreat held on campus.
</p>
<p>
  The April 22 event included lectures and presentations by faculty at the Jack Baskin Engineering Auditorium, dinner with the chancellor at the University House, as well as an evening of North Indian music featuring sarodist Aashish Khan and tabla artist Pranesh Khan--the sons of world-renowned musician, composer, and teacher Ali Akbar Khan--at the Music Center Recital Hall.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "I am proud that one of my first guest groups from our regional community is such a distinguished gathering of businesspeople who understand the value of higher education," noted Chancellor Denice D. Denton in her opening remarks. "We look forward to creating new global partnerships with educational institutions and businesses that share our vision," she added.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Professors Raja Guha Thakurta (astronomy and astrophysics), David Deamer (chemistry and biochemistry), Daniel Press (environmental studies), and Joshua Stuart (biomolecular engineering) treated the guests to presentations illustrating how technology is integral to the advancement of academic inquiry and the discovery of knowledge across a wide range of fields. Arts Division dean Edward Houghton and Dard Neuman, who holds the new Hasan Endowed Chair in Indian Classical Music, also presented an overview of UCSC's program in South Asian studies, which focuses on the culture, music, film, and visual arts of India.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Guests at the retreat included Dr. Anuradha Luther Maitra, CEO of the software company, Floreat Inc., who established the annual Sidhartha Maitra Lecture Series at UCSC; Dr. Kamil Hasan, founder of HiTek Venture Partners, and his wife, Talat Hasan, who together endowed the Kamil and Talat Hasan Chair in Indian Classical Music; and Kumar Malavalli, CEO of InMage Systems, who recently made a gift of $1 million to UCSC to establish the Malavalli Endowed Chair in Storage Systems Research at the Baskin School of Engineering.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The Indus Entrepreneurs (TiE) group was founded in Silicon Valley in 1992. The organization has rapidly grown to include more than 40 chapters in nine countries. The name signifies the ethnic South Asian or Indus roots, and "TiE" stands for Talent, Ideas, and Enterprise.<br>

        <title>Scholar warns against mixing religion and foreign policy</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 02 May 2005 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>

        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_6467" align="alignright" width="150"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/05/lease_gary.05-05-02.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-6467" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/05/lease_gary.05-05-02.jpg" alt="Gary Lease met the future Pope Benedict XVI years ago in Munich.

<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  Gary Lease--interim dean of humanities at UCSC and an internationally recognized expert on the history of religion--has been studying the relationship between politics and religion for more than two decades.
</p>
<p>
  He recently returned from Tokyo where he presented his research at a conference of the International Association for the History of Religions.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "I've been looking at an unstudied element--the secretaries of state at the Vatican during the 19th and 20th centuries," Lease observed. "And the results have been very revealing. My conclusion: you're asking for trouble when you confuse religion and foreign policy."<br>
</p>
<p>
  "When you start making foreign policy based on religion, and particularly when it's fueled by religion based on absolute beliefs, you get some horrific results," said Lease. "The new pope is going to suffer from this problem," he added.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Lease cited examples such as the policy of the Vatican during World War II, noting the controversy over whether Pius XII and the Roman church did enough to help the Jews in Europe during Hitler's reign. "Religion tells you that you are primarily responsible for those who believe what you do," Lease explained. "For those who don't, it's often tough luck for them--they're left on the margins."
</p>
<p>
  He said that his many years of work on the relationship between religion and Germany's National Socialism also have led him to the same conclusions.
</p>
<p>
  Lease also cited Vatican foreign policy in Palestine. "There you have Christian Arabs on one side and Jewish Israelis on the other," he said. "What you find is a diplomatic leaning on the side of your co-believers. And that is, in essence, a moral judgment."
</p>
<p>
  "The same thing has happened with Iraq, which has been portrayed as a 'battle against evil and Saddam Hussein,'" Lease added. "History has shown, when you get into that kind of language and it becomes ingrained into your foreign policy decisions, the results are disastrous."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Lease studied in Germany at the University of Munich, eventually earning a doctorate degree in theology in 1968. His expertise covers a remarkable range of fields including early Christian archaeology, Vatican foreign policy and canon law, German intellectual history, German Judaism, and religious/cultural evolution. In 2001, Lease returned to the University of Munich as a guest professor, occupying the renowned Romano Guardini Chair for Theory of Culture and Religion.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "I met Joseph Ratzinger (Pope Benedict XVI) when I was a student at Munich," Lease noted. "Based on his remarks of the last 20 years and the last two months, it appears he will continue to mix religion with foreign policy, which will in turn lead to troubling results."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Lease joined the faculty at UCSC in 1973 and was chair of the History of Consciousness Department from 1998 to 2004. He has also chaired the UCSC Religious Studies Department, served as director of the Education Abroad Program in Goettingen, West Germany, and was dean of the UCSC Humanities Division from 1990 to 1995.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Lease served as the executive secretary of the North American Association for the Study of Religion from 1995 to 2005 and was recently reelected treasurer of the International Association for the History of Religions--the presenter of the Tokyo conference that was attended by more than 1,700 scholars from around the world.<br>

        <title>Equality remains elusive, says cultural critic Herman Gray</title>

<a name="content" id="content"></a><br>
<a href="mailto:jmcnulty@ucsc.edu">Jennifer McNulty</a>
<p>
  Over the past decade, African Americans have become more visible on the cultural landscape of the United States: Jazz trumpet virtuoso Wynton Marsalis is the artistic director of Jazz at Lincoln Center; African Americans are widely seen on network television; and African Americans represent the nation at the highest levels of power.
</p>
<p>
  In the new book <i>Cultural Moves: African Americans and the Politics of Representation</i> (Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 2005), author Herman Gray explores the impact of such inroads on U.S. culture, examining these achievements in relation to persistent gaps in the struggle for greater social justice and equality.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "I want my multiracial 6-year-old grandson to be able to turn on the television and see other people of color, but we can't stop there," said Gray, a professor of sociology and chair of the department at UCSC. "Just because television does a better job now of representing our diversity doesn't mean we've achieved our goals of justice and equality."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Among the "cultural moves" Gray explores in the book are:<br>
</p>
<p>
  * How Wynton Marsalis and his creation of a jazz canon at Lincoln Center increased the cultural visibility and legitimacy of jazz.<br>
</p>
<p>
  * How shifting ground undermines the struggle for racial equality: years of activism increased the representation of African Americans on network television, only to have conservatives use the milestone to claim that racism and inequality are problems of the past.<br>
</p>
<p>
  * How black musicians Steve Coleman, George Lewis, and Pamela Z use new technology to shape and extend black musical traditions and cultural identities.<br>
</p>
<p>
  In <i>Cultural Moves,</i> Gray examines the impact of culture on political change and explores how black popular culture has shaped the nation's cultural imagination.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "We've witnessed cultural moves used by African Americans to consolidate a sense of power, of belonging and representation. Wynton Marsalis embodies African American accomplishment in jazz," said Gray. "But Marsalis also has a powerful sense of himself as an African American person. His visibility has helped place African Americans at the center of national identity."<br>
</p>
<p>
  At the same time, notes Gray, other jazz musicians remain invisible, including those in the "jazz left," such as saxophonist Steve Coleman, who brings what Gray called a "diasporic approach" to his music, blending hip-hop and be-bop, and traveling to Africa and Cuba to incorporate those musical influences.
</p>
<p>
  "The price to pay for arrival is what's left out. For every cultural move, there's a countermove," Gray added wryly. "Marsalis is at the center of publicity and promotion. Coleman, too, wants to get African American music ensconced in the American national imagination, but he went a different route. He travels, and he goes to community centers, where he teaches and creates community connections."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Gray also trains his critical eye on information technology, going beyond issues of competence and access to document how African American creative artists are using technology in their work and to explore the "racial logic" inherent in new information technologies.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Lewis, a trombonist who also composes on computers, found that some of the programming software he used in composing was unable to mimic in real time some fundamental elements of the African American musical form, including syncopation, collective improvisation, and call-and-response.
</p>
<p>
  "The programs are incapable of emulating some of the rhythmic and spatial requirements that define African American music," said Gray. "Lewis's work reveals how the logic of computer programming is already structured in a 'racial logic,' in turn challenging the idea that new information technologies are neutral."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Gray points out the limits of a civil-rights strategy based on inclusion and representation. "In a global logic that celebrates rather than represses differences of all kinds, what does it mean to petition for greater visibility when the racial landscape has shifted?" asks Gray.
</p>
<p>
  "Network television is like Lincoln Center: It is useful as an aspiration--to a point. More doesn't guarantee you justice, it just guarantees you more. It is not necessarily a gain to have African Americans as secretary of state or national security adviser if they're still dropping bombs on people."<br>

        <title>UCSC receives Technology for Teaching grant from Hewlett-Packard</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 02 May 2005 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>5741</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  Hewlett-Packard has selected UCSC to receive a 2005 HP Technology for Teaching grant, designed to transform and improve learning in the classroom through innovative uses of technology.
</p>
<p>
  UCSC's Jack Baskin School of Engineering will receive an award package of HP products and a faculty stipend valued at more than $74,000.<br>
</p>
<p>
  UCSC is one of 31 colleges and universities nationwide to receive the grant, which includes HP wireless equipment for use by students and faculty in the classroom. The equipment includes wireless HP tablet PCs, a portable digital projector, and associated equipment. The tablet PCs are lightweight laptop computers that allow pen-based input, so that, for example, an instructor can write notes by hand on the tablet and project them onto a screen.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "It's like having an infinite blackboard," said Ira Pohl, professor and chair of computer science. "We have faculty who are already using this type of interface in their teaching, and we'd like to combine that with ways for students to communicate with the instructor."<br>
</p>
<p>
  For example, in a classroom where both students and instructor have tablet PCs, the students could write answers to questions on their tablets and the instructor could see what the students are writing, then put a student's answer up on the screen where the whole class could see it. The handwritten input can also be used in combination with sound recording to record lectures, Pohl said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "The exciting thing is that the tablet PC is such a flexible platform. This will enable us to do some truly innovative teaching, taking the classroom into the 21st century," he said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  UCSC's Baskin School of Engineering, founded in 1997, offers undergraduate degree programs in bioinformatics, computer engineering, computer science, electrical engineering, and information systems management, as well as graduate programs in bioinformatics, computer engineering, computer science, and electrical engineering. The school serves the needs of the greater Silicon Valley region and the state of California by creating and spreading knowledge through research and teaching, and by offering curricula that nurture creative thinking and prepare students for productive careers at industrial and academic settings in rapidly evolving areas of science and engineering.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The 2005 HP Technology for Teaching grant program is awarding grants totaling $8.5 million to 174 kindergarten through 12th grade public schools and 31 two- and four-year colleges and universities in the United States and Puerto Rico. HP has committed $25 million to the three-year program, which supports HP's broader education goal of transforming teaching and learning through the integration of technology. More than 400 schools worldwide have received grants since the program's inception last year.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "Technology has the power to positively transform the learning process for both educators and students," said Bess Stephens, vice president for philanthropy and education at HP. "By integrating technology into their teaching, educators can engage students in new and innovative ways to increase achievement, and ultimately prepare them for greater success in the classroom and beyond."<br>
</p>

<p>
  State senator Jackie Speier (D-San Francisco/San Mateo) spent Friday, April 29, on campus meeting with Chancellor Denton, students, faculty, and members of the senior administration. Speier's visit was part of a listening tour of all the UC campuses that she has undertaken to better understand the impacts of state budget cuts. Speier's meetings on Friday covered a wide range of topics, including enrollment, diversity in faculty hiring, and the ethics of genomics, in addition to the effects of budget cuts on the UCSC campus. She also participated in a roundtable discussion with students, pictured above.

        <title>Prediction Walk/Run relay set for May 17</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 02 May 2005 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  Walkers, joggers, skippers, hoppers, and/or runners are welcome to try to predict their teams' collective times at the 18th Annual Prediction Walk/Run relay race on Tuesday, May 17, from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m.
</p>
<p>
  The lighthearted competition involves four-member relay teams traveling two miles (one-half mile per person) around the East Field track. Participants do not have to walk or run fast to win the event--the closest actual time to the predicted time wins.
</p>
<p>
  Participants will all receive free t-shirts, and multiple prizes will be awarded, including one for best baton. While the emphasis is on fun, the event also has a serious side, with wellness activities and health information as well as refreshments offered. The event is open to all staff and faculty members.
</p>
<p>
  For more information or to print out a registration form, go to <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/opers/walkrun05.pdf">http://www2.ucsc.edu/opers/walkrun05.pdf</a> or call (831) 459-2531. The entry deadline is May 10.
</p>
<p>
  The race is sponsored by OPERS, the Bay Tree Bookstore, and Human Resources.

        <title>UCSC hosts first 'Good Neighbor' community forum May 12</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 02 May 2005 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>5735</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  The first in a series of "Good Neighbor Forums" sponsored by UCSC will take place Thursday, May 12, from 6 to 9 p.m. in the Multipurpose Room at Harbor High School. The topic of the discussion, which is open to all members of the university and town community, will be the promotion of tolerance and a safe atmosphere in the public spaces of our diverse community.
</p>
<p>
  From beaches and parks to public school campuses and downtown sidewalks, public spaces are designed to be welcoming to all. Do we, as a community, ensure that all our public spaces are used and enjoyed by everyone? This gathering will provide a forum for discussion and an opportunity to address the question, "What is needed to make individuals feel safe and comfortable in public spaces around Santa Cruz?"
</p>
<p>
  Featured speakers will address different aspects of the issue. UCSC sociology professor John Brown Childs will discuss his vision of how groups can preserve their uniqueness while engaging across race, class, and gender, and former Santa Cruz mayor Scott Kennedy will discuss ways to diffuse potentially volatile situations. School and local government officials, as well as local residents and representatives of the university and community organizations, are encouraged to attend.
</p>
<p>
  The event is being presented by the UCSC Good Neighbor Initiative, which was launched last fall to build and maintain better relations with the Santa Cruz community. UCSC undergraduates Kristen Townsend and Anthony Tucci are directing the initiative under the auspices of the campus's Office of Government and Community Relations. The Santa Cruz Community Good Neighbor Advisory Board is a network of people working to increase discussion about what it means to be good neighbors in a community that cares about its citizens.
</p>
<p>
  "We've heard from students of color on campus and from some students at local high schools who say they avoid certain places because they feel unsafe or unwelcome," said Donna Blitzer, director of the Office of Government and Community Relations. "We want to provide a forum for information sharing and brainstorming, so we can collaborate on ways to make our community more welcoming and comfortable for everyone."
</p>
<p>
  Participants are encouraged to share their experiences with exclusion and inclusion in the community and to offer input regarding changes they would like to see.

<p>
  Asian American/Pacific Islander Heritage Month gets under way May 4 with a performance by Jeremy Bautista, hip-hop/jazz musician and member of the poetry group 8th Wonder, from 6 to 8 p.m. at the Colleges Nine/Ten Multipurpose Room. A $5 donation at the door will be requested, with funds going to tsunami relief.
</p>
<p>
  "Shift the Seen: Reconstructing Self-Representation" is the theme of the monthlong celebration, which "challenges stereotypes and will be a catalyst in broadening perspectives by exposing AA/PI identities through art, music, film, and dialogue," according to organizers.

<p>
  UCSC Child Care and Early Education Services (CCEES) has earned accreditation from the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC)--the nation's leading organization of early childhood professionals.
</p>
<p>
  "We're proud to be accredited by NAEYC and recognized for our commitment to reaching the highest professional standards," said Wilma Gold, director of the program. "NAEYC accreditation lets families in our community know that children in our program are getting the best care and early learning experiences".
</p>
<p>
  CCEES includes an infant and toddler program, the Granary Child Development Center, the Children's Center Preschool, and the School Age Center. These four programs serve 120 children from three months to 12 years. All the programs are included in the accreditation.<br>
</p>
<p>
  To earn NAEYC's accreditation, a program conducts a self-study to determine how well it meets the standards. After necessary improvements are made, the program is observed by independent professional validators and then reviewed by a national panel. Programs are accredited by NAEYC for a five-year period.
</p>
<p>
  The recent NAEYC accreditation coincided with the initiation of a Guest Reader Program at the Granary. To raise visibility, momentum, and excitement for child care, Associate Vice Chancellor Jean Marie Scott kicked off the new program on March 30 by reading two of her favorite books, <i>The Little Rabbit and the Sea</i> and <i>The Big Hungry Bear</i>. The next guest reader will be professor of psychology Maureen Callanan.<br>

<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  Wide sand beaches are a prized feature of Santa Cruz and other communities along the northern coast of Monterey Bay. But are they just a temporary aberration, destined to shrink in the years to come?
</p>
<p>
  That is the hypothesis championed by Gerald Weber, lecturer emeritus in the Department of Earth Sciences and a consulting geologist.
</p>
<p>
  According to Weber, northern Monterey Bay beaches have been kept abnormally wide over the past 200 to 300 years by an excess of sand drifting down the coast from a large temporary source north of Ano Nuevo. That source is now exhausted.
</p>
<p>
  Beaches just south of Ano Nuevo have already shrunk in the past 30 years, and Weber said he expects that trend to spread slowly south to Santa Cruz and beyond.
</p>
<p>
  "Beaches down drift from Point Ano Nuevo have shrunk drastically over the past 25 to 30 years, and sea-cliff erosion is accelerating," Weber said.
</p>
<p>
  Other geologists, however, do not anticipate dramatic changes. Gary Griggs, professor of Earth sciences and an expert on coastal erosion, said he believes that the dune fields north of Ano Nuevo provided only a small fraction of the sand nourishing Santa Cruz beaches.
</p>
<p>
  "Losing the Ano Nuevo sand supply may not have a significant effect on beaches in the Monterey Bay because of the large amount of littoral sand supplied by other sources," Griggs said.
</p>
<p>
  Weber said he is used to that kind of skepticism. "When I first presented this idea in 1981, people thought I was nuts," he said. But he said he has accumulated more evidence over the past 20 years.
</p>
<p>
  Weber made his case last week in a presentation on Friday, April 29, at a joint regional meeting of the American Geological Society and the American Association of Petroleum Geologists in San Jose.
</p>
<p>
  Beaches are constantly remodeled by coastal currents that bring sand in and take it away. Along the northern California coastline, the current runs northwest to southeast. Santa Cruz beaches contain material from as far north as Half Moon Bay, Weber said.
</p>
<p>
  A thin beach leaves cliffs exposed to the erosive power of waves, eventually causing the coastline to recede. As cliffs crumble, the beach widens, until an equilibrium is reached in which the beach remains wide enough to protect the cliffs from further erosion.
</p>
<p>
  In Santa Cruz County, the equilibrium was tipped toward wider beaches some 300 years ago, when Ano Nuevo Island separated from the mainland, perhaps as the result of an earthquake on the San Gregorio fault. A channel formed between the island and Point Ano Nuevo, opening the way for sand trapped north of the point to gradually drift down the coast to more southern beaches. The extra sand made southern beaches wider, buffering the cliffs from the waves.
</p>
<p>
  After releasing 13 to 20 million cubic yards of sand through the channel, the northern sand sources are now exhausted, Weber said. Southern beaches, no longer receiving an excess of sand drifting from the north, have started to shrink, and cliff erosion is poised to resume. The phenomenon is particularly pronounced at Point Ano Nuevo and Greyhound Rock, three miles south of Point Ano Nuevo, where beaches have receded by 60 to 75 feet over the past 30 years, Weber said.
</p>
<p>
  Weber said he expects the phenomenon to spread further south within the next 20 to 100 years.
</p>
<p>
  "A period of thin beaches and increased coastal erosion in northern Monterey Bay is near," Weber said.
</p>
<p>
  Griggs said he does not dispute the depletion of the sand sources north of Ano Nuevo. But he said the amount of sand they contributed--approximately 50,000 cubic yards per year, according to Weber's estimates--is small compared to the river of sand traveling southward along the coast--some 250,000 cubic yards per year. "What I question is the magnitude of the effect," he said.
</p>
<p>
  Sand travels along the central California coast at approximately one mile per year. Santa Cruz beaches, 15 to 20 miles south of Ano Nuevo, should have begun to show the effects of a decreased sand supply by now. But they have not been shrinking, Griggs said. The effect of the Ano Nuevo sands might be too dilute to have a discernible impact by the time they reach Santa Cruz, he said.
</p>
<p>
  Weber said he expects a decrease in beach width to take place over an extended period of time, just as the increase in width during the period of excess sand supply would have been a gradual process involving relatively small amounts of extra sand in any one year.
</p>
<p>
  "This is a process that slowly built up beach width over a period of perhaps 50 to 75 years, and I anticipate that the decrease in beach width will also not occur suddenly," he said.
</p>
<p>
  Both Griggs and Weber agreed that understanding beach dynamics requires long-term observations because the system is so variable. "Most of our understanding of cliff erosion is based on observations that only span the last 30 to 50 years," Weber said.
</p>
<p>
  By contrast, he based his hypothesis on historic maps going back to the time of the missions and photographic records from the past 75 years. And only time will tell if his interpretation is accurate.
</p>
<p>
  "I'll probably be dead by the time we know if I'm right about this," he said.<br>

<p>
  Two scholars affiliated with UCSC have been elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (AAAS), one of the most prestigious honors bestowed upon the world's leading scientists, academics, artists, businesspeople, and public leaders.
</p>
<p>
  Former chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood and Michael Soule, professor emeritus of environmental studies, were among the 213 new Fellows and Honorary Members announced last week.
</p>
<p>
  Greenwood, now UC provost and senior vice president of academic affairs, served as chancellor of the UCSC campus from 1996 to 2004. She also holds a UCSC appointment as professor of biology. In her current post, she is UC's highest-ranking woman.
</p>
<p>
  Soule, who joined the UCSC faculty in 1989, has been called "the father of conservation biology." He is a cofounder of the Wildlands Project and the Society for Conservation Biology. Now living in Colorado, Soule has written and edited many books on biology and conservation biology, including <i>Conservation Biology: An Evolutionary-Ecological Perspective</i> with B. A. Wilcox; <i>Conservation and Evolution</i> with O. H. Frankel; <i>Conservation Biology: The Science of Scarcity and Diversity; Viable Populations for Conservation; Research Priorities for Conservation Biology</i> with K. A. Kohm; <i>Reinventing Nature? Responses to Postmodern Deconstruction</i> with Gary Lease, a UCSC professor of history of consciousness; and <i>Continental Conservation: Scientific Foundations of Regional Reserve Networks</i> with John Terborgh.
</p>
<p>
  Soule has conducted pioneering research in various fields, including population and evolutionary biology, population genetics, island biogeography, environmental studies, biodiversity policy, and ethics. His most recent work focuses on the genetic basis of fitness and viability in natural populations, on the impacts of "keystone" species, and on the social causes of the destruction of nature worldwide. He was previously elected a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and he has received a Guggenheim Fellowship, as well as the Archie Carr Medal.
</p>
<p>
  "It gives me great pleasure to welcome these outstanding leaders in their fields in this, the Academy's 225th year," said Academy President Patricia Meyer Spacks. "Fellows are selected through a highly competitive process that recognizes individuals who have made preeminent contributions to their disciplines and to society at large."
</p>
<p>
  Fellows and Foreign Honorary Members are nominated and elected to the Academy by current members. The Academy will welcome this year's new Fellows and Foreign Honorary Members at its annual induction ceremony on October 8 at the Academy's headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
</p>
<p>
  Founded in 1780, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences is an international learned society composed of the world's leading scientists, scholars, artists, businesspeople, and public leaders.
</p>
<p>
  A complete list of newly elected members and their affiliations is available on the Academy web site at <a href="http://www.amacad.org">http://www.amacad.org</a>

<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  A top reporter for the <i>Los Angeles Times,</i> Hector Tobar takes pride in telling the stories of people who are often overlooked by the media.
</p>
<p>
  One of his best days on the job was actually a night he spent under the stars on the war-torn Iraq-Syria border.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Tobar was sent to Baghdad in June 2003 to cover the early days of the war. In the wake of a failed U.S. attack targeting Saddam Hussein, Tobar traveled to the remote Iraqi border village that had been hit.<br>
</p>
<p>
  He arrived late in the afternoon. The only American in the village, Tobar was immediately surrounded by a dozen Bedouin children, who looked at him like he "was from outer space." Tobar realized there wasn't time to do his reporting and get back to Baghdad by curfew. He stayed to get the villagers' story.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The hamlet was an outpost for Bedouin smugglers, the most successful of whom lived in spacious concrete houses. Tobar talked with residents, who spoke of a mother and infant who were killed in the attack and five homes that had been destroyed. Then, in a surreal twist, Tobar was invited into the home of a local sheik, where he sat with several men and watched a televised press conference of U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld discussing the attack that had rocked the village hours earlier.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Tobar filed his story by satellite phone. That night, he slept under the stars beside his translator and driver.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "I felt lucky to be a journalist that night," says Tobar. "It was worth the little bit of fear I felt. Looking up at Scorpio, I had never seen its star so bright. I felt connected to this really distant, strange, exotic place, and I had told their story." It ran under the headline, "Tiny Bedouin Village Is Caught in Path of the Hunt for Hussein."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Tobar, now Buenos Aires bureau chief for the <i>Los Angeles Times,</i> has had an outstanding career, sharing the 1992 Pulitzer Prize for the paper's coverage of the Los Angeles riots. "Talking to people and telling stories--it's an honorable living," he says.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The son of Guatemalan immigrants, Tobar was raised in southern California. "My mother was 19 and pregnant, and my father had saved up enough money for a television or to move to the United States or Europe. He decided the television could wait, and they moved to Los Angeles."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Tobar's father began working in hotels and delivering the newspaper his son would later write for. Tobar attended public schools and got good grades, but it wasn't until college that his eagerness to learn was reciprocated. "In college, I met people who really challenged me," he says.<br>
</p>
<p>
  At UCSC, Tobar took and audited classes in everything from biology to McCarthyism. He learned about national liberation struggles from literature professor Roberto Crespi in the Oakes College core course and "suddenly got the bug to learn this history of Latin America that I had not been taught," he says.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Crespi, who died in 1992, was "one of the most dogmatic people I've ever met. He believed in the creative process, and he demanded it from his students," says Tobar. Sociology professor Jim O'Connor had "a passion for social change. I felt lucky to be in his presence and to listen to his lectures. I remember looking at the world differently."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Ultimately, says Tobar, UCSC is what made him a writer. After graduating, he started out in 1988 at a community newspaper in San Francisco. He earned $9/hour and felt he was in heaven because he was being paid to write. Tobar moved a year later to the <i>Times,</i> where he participated in the paper's Minority Editorial Training Program, was hired, and spent four years as a metro reporter. That "first incarnation" of his career, as Tobar describes it, ended unhappily. He felt like the paper's "token Latino," and he was emotionally drained from his work on the police beat.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "One of the things that made me a good reporter was that I had an excess of empathy," he says. "When I was in my mid-20s, I had a very gentle soul. I would weep with people, and after a while, they would not be able to stop talking about their son or daughter who had died."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Tobar left the paper to explore fiction writing, He earned an M.F.A. in creative writing from UC Irvine, and published his first book, the novel <i>The Tattooed Soldier.</i> The experience helped him find his "inner poet," and he returned to the <i>Times</i> in 1996. Today, he is considered one of the paper's best "stylists," a distinction that prompts a self-conscious laugh.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "The first time I was a journalist, I was cautious, having learned that it was forgivable to be late, boring, or to write flat prose, but that if you messed up the facts, you wouldn't be a journalist very long," explains Tobar. "Fiction let my imagination loose."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Shortly after returning to the paper, Tobar felt the familiar chafing of racial politics. He was the only Latino reporter on the daily metro staff. "I'm not really big on race or ethnicity, but I've never felt so brown in all my life," recalls Tobar.<br>
</p>
<p>
  He told his editor he was going to quit but was urged to stay on. Weeks later, the <i>Times</i> announced its "Latino Initiative," and Tobar got "one of the best jobs in the world." As Latino national affairs correspondent, and then as a roving national correspondent, Tobar had license to go anywhere in the country. And he did.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "I had so many story ideas--story ideas are really what's carried me in journalism."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Those stories inspired his new book, <i>Translation Nation: Defining a New American Identity in the Spanish-speaking United States,</i> which arrives in stores this week. The book weaves together Tobar's wanderings through what he calls the new "Latin Republic of the United States," beginning with his parents in Los Angeles and ending in Baghdad, where he does a favor for a Dominican American military policeman from Brooklyn.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Tobar feels privileged to "give voice" to so many people he's encountered in his travels, and he is grateful to his wife, UCSC alumna Virginia Espino (psychology, 1987), who makes his work possible. The two met at UCSC but didn't connect until years later in Los Angeles. The couple have three children--Dante, 8; Diego, 5; and Luna, 5 months.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "My wife is extremely understanding," says Tobar, who finished his book by rising early and writing before the kids woke up. "It's the ambition. My ambition is such that it's a disease. It's an obsession."<br>

        <title>Tent University disbands after contentious week</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 25 Apr 2005 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>5697</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  Tent University (TU), billed by on- and off-campus organizers as a protest against traditional higher education and a rally for a number of social causes, disbanded at UCSC late last week after five days that included the arrest of 19 protestors.
</p>
<p>
  TU organizers had advertised their event broadly on the Internet and in various print and broadcast media, inviting anyone to camp overnight at the entrance of the campus. UCSC policy bans camping, and general public access to campus is prohibited after 8 p.m. In addition, campus officials emphasized that the base of campus is inappropriate as a 24-hour-a-day venue because of its proximity to the Granary child care center and adjacent residential neighborhoods. Officials also expressed concern about their inability to provide overnight security for students in an open area at a busy intersection.
</p>
<p>
  Through a series of meetings occurring for more than a week prior to the event, Student Affairs staff informed TU organizers of these policies and concerns, as well as the potential consequences of their proposed actions. Several alternatives, all of which were rejected, were offered to TU organizers regarding the time, place, and manner guidelines for their event.
</p>
<p>
  On Tuesday evening, a day after the arrests, protesters decided to accept the campus offer to waive its camping ban, thus permitting the nighttime activities to relocate to the Quarry Amphitheater. Daytime events continued throughout the week at the base of campus, and a number of faculty members participated in discussions on the site.

        <title>Students tackle tough issues with Good Neighbor Initiative</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 25 Apr 2005 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>5695</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_5694" align="alignright" width="180"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/04/townsend_tucci.05-04-25.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-5694" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/04/townsend_tucci.05-04-25.jpg" alt="Kristen Townsend and Anthony Tucci play key roles in the Good Neighbor Initiative Photo: Louise Donahue" width="180" height="258" /></a>Kristen Townsend and Anthony Tucci play key roles in the Good Neighbor Initiative Photo: Louise Donahue[/caption]
<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  No one could accuse the Good Neighbor Initiative of ducking the hard issues.
</p>
<p>
  In its first full year of operation, the effort is focusing on two of the thorniest problems in the town-gown relationship: traffic and students living in residential areas off campus.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The initiative, begun last spring by then-Acting Chancellor Martin M. Chemers and continued by Chancellor Denice D. Denton, draws on an unusual partnership between student interns and administrators.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Chemers wanted students to be involved in efforts to improve community relations and added two new students--biology junior Kristen Townsend and Anthony Tucci, a second-year history major--to his Chancellor's Undergraduate Internship Program to play key roles.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Each intern has concentrated on one broad area, with Tucci focused on the impact students have on residential neighborhoods, and Townsend honing in on transportation issues and organizing a community forum. Their efforts are coordinated by the Office of Government and Community Relations, headed by Donna Blitzer.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "It's been a great program for helping engage students in how the campus and the city interact with one another," said Blitzer. "The student interns have put a face to the students, and countered some of the stereotypes."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Debbie Elston, a founding member of the community group Santa Cruz Neighbors, an umbrella group of neighbor organizations, has nothing but praise for Tucci, who has met regularly with the organization and other neighbor groups and researched community issues at other UC campuses.
</p>
<p>
  She said Tucci has been "wonderful" to deal with, and that she is optimistic that efforts by the campus, coupled with more enforcement by the city and police, will improve the situation for neighbors.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "I am very grateful that Chancellor Chemers got the ball rolling. He opened doors for dialogue with the neighbors," said Elston. "I believe Chancellor Denton will continue that. She seems very approachable and concerned."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Tucci is developing Good Neighbor Guidelines for UCSC, using a set of campus-community guidelines from UC Riverside as a starting point. The guidelines for students detail everything from establishing friendly contact with nonstudent neighbors to liability issues and key local ordinances.
</p>
<p>
  The guidelines will be printed and distributed on and off campus.<br>
  "Just being a student and trying to work out responsible solutions, I've found neighbors are very receptive to this project," Tucci said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  In addition to working directly with neighbors' groups, Tucci will be promoting housing at the Village, UCSC Inn, and the UCSC Town Center as an alternative for those who may not want to live in residence halls or student apartments.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Tucci and Townsend are working together on an online survey asking students about their housing preferences as well as transportation issues, Townsend's focus.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Areas covered in the survey include off-campus parking lots with shuttle service to campus; the level of satisfaction with Metro and campus shuttle service; bicycle use; and carpooling.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Townsend has been promoting the purchase of electric bicycles as well as the use of parking at the Boardwalk and in church lots to reduce congestion and parking problems in residential areas. Flyers promoting both electric bikes and parking options have been been posted throughout campus<br>
</p>
<p>
  Another project Townsend is working on is the Community Good Neighbor Forum from 6 to 9 p.m. on May 12 at Harbor High School.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The forum will include three speakers: UCSC sociology professor John Brown Childs; Scott Kennedy of the Resource Center for Nonviolence; and Celia Rowland of the Santa Cruz County District Attorney's Office. Following short presentations from each speaker, the audience will be divided into 20-minute breakout sessions.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "We really hope the campus and community will start talking," said Townsend. "The forum will be very interactive."<br>

        <title>Making sense of the campus's LRDP project</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 25 Apr 2005 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>

<p>
  In an effort to provide additional information to the campus community about the process of updating the campus's Long Range Development Plan, <i>Currents</i> is periodically discussing various aspects of the LRDP with campus personnel.
</p>
<p>
  This month's Q& A is with Ilse Kolbus, director of Physical Plant who leads a team of experts on the "infrastructure" issues related to the planning project.<br>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Q:</b> <b>What precisely is meant by the term "infrastructure" in planning documents like the LRDP?</b><br>
</p>
<p>
  <b>A:</b> Infrastructure is a broad term used to define the services and facilities that support the day-to-day operations of the campus. These typically include utility systems such as water, electricity, gas, and sewer systems; transportation networks such as paths, roads and bridges; central heating and cooling systems; and communication networks-all the campus elements that usually are in the background, but which are necessary for the academic and service mission work of the campus to take place.<br>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Q:</b> <b>Which aspect of infrastructure may be the most challenging for a campus like UCSC that is growing?</b><br>
</p>
<p>
  <b>A:</b> From my perspective, there are two main infrastructure issues that will challenge the campus as it plans for future growth-aging systems that will require upgrade and expansion, which is a financial resource issue, and ensuring an adequate water supply as we endeavor to house more students, faculty, and staff on campus. Of the two, it's possible that water will emerge as the most challenging infrastructure issue in the 2005 LRDP. I say this because water is a resource that we obtain from the City of Santa Cruz, and the city's planning studies indicate it has a limited supply. Without development of additional sources, the city's water supply is constrained in drought years. Given this, it will be important that the campus, which has an impressive history of water conservation, do even more in this area.<br>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Q: What kind of record does the campus have in terms of working with the city on water issues and for conserving water?</b><br>
</p>
<p>
  <b>A:</b> The campus has contributed to capital improvement projects and upgrades of the water system as part of its mitigation measures in the 1988 LRDP. It is also committed to exploring assistance to the city in future system upgrades and in the development of new supplies.<br>
  More importantly, the campus is committed to implementing water conservation measures. Since 1986, enrollment has grown around 70 percent and water use has increased only 20 percent. This has been achieved by installing water-conserving fixtures and through improved irrigation techniques and the planting of drought-tolerant landscaping. We have also worked to educate our students about the importance of careful water use.<br>
</p>
<p>
  To accommodate the growth outlined in the LRDP the campus will need to be even more aggressive when it comes to water conservation. New buildings such as Engineering 2, for example, incorporate waterless urinals, each one of which saves 40,000 gallons of water annually. Retrofitting existing buildings with these kinds of features could produce substantial water savings campuswide.<br>
</p>
<p>
  On the supply end of the equation, the campus could explore development of its own water supply, and maintain our long-standing willingness to assist the city in developing additional water resources.<br>

<p>
  <i>Lubricious Transfer</i>--an ambitious dance experiment in live, transcontinental collaboration using the Internet--was broadcast simultaneously earlier this month to audiences at UCSC's Experimental Theater and New York University's Frederick Loewe Theater.
</p>
<p>
  The April 15 and 16 performances were the culmination of a distance arts education project undertaken by an interdisciplinary mix of students, staff, and faculty at both universities. The result was an interactive, real-time performance where UCSC dancers performed in front of three "liquid screens," upon which live images of the New York University dancers were simultaneously projected.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The project was conceived by new UCSC assistant theater arts professor Ted Warburton and carried out in his movement research class last quarter. UCSC's technical staff provided the expertise and instruction that eventually enabled students to run all of the technical aspects of the performances.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "I believe this is the first course in the U.S. to offer students both the opportunity to perform and to acquire the technical knowledge necessary to produce this type of event," noted Warburton. "We had both groups of performers on opposite sides of the country working together--interconnected and interdependent--using advanced telecommunications for artistic collaborative purposes."
</p>
<p>
  Warburton has danced professionally with American Ballet Theatre and holds a doctoral degree in psychology from Harvard, as well as a master's in technology.
</p>
<p>
  He came to UCSC last summer from New York University, where he served as the director of its dance program. As a result, he invited Ben Munisteri, an award-winning choreographer who recently decided to attend graduate school at NYU, to collaborate from New York. Together, they set up a series of videoconferencing sessions to help create the event.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "There is a strong research component to this project," added Warburton. "We're interested in how students' perceptions of technology change and whether the technology is inhibiting or enabling creativity."<br>
</p>
<p>
  "There is not much research on distance education and zero research on arts distance education," he noted. "This is a new genre of art, and we are doing creative research pushing the boundaries of the dance discipline."<br>
  <br>

<p>
  Hundreds of alumni returned to UCSC to reminisce and take part in a whirlwind weekend of celebrations during Banana Slug Spring Fair, April 15-17.
</p>
<p>
  Most events--including the All-Alumni Luncheon, the panel discussion featuring Class of 1975 graduates, and the Distinguished Faculty Lecture, took place on Saturday, April 16.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "What a glorious day it was," said Vice Chancellor of University Relations Ronald P. Suduiko. "You could feel the excitement in the air as we celebrated the 40th anniversary of the campus while introducing Chancellor Denton to alumni and friends from around the country."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Dozens of faculty members joined alumni and friends, students and staff members in the celebration.<br>
</p>
<p>
  An overflow crowd of alumni, faculty, and friends attended the Distinguished Faculty Lecture, "Prisonworld: What 25 Years of Overincarceration Has Done to Prisoners and to the Rest of Us," presented by professor of psychology Craig Haney in the University Center's Bhojwani Dining Room.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Another popular event was the Class of 1975 30-Year Reunion Panel Discussion featuring Philip Brookman, Carol Realini, Laurie Garrett, and Gordon Wiltsie.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Several classes and groups held special celebrations, including Black Escargot, UCSC's African American affinity group, which marked its every-five-year reunion with a mentor circle featuring current students; a dinner and dance; and an alumni, faculty, and staff reception.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Visiting reunion classes once again proved generous to their old school, raising $1.7 million for student support and other campus projects.
</p>
<p>
  There was a bittersweet note on Saturday as 120 family members, friends, and colleagues of the late Eric Thomas, former president of the UCSC Alumni Association, attended the dedication of a memorial bench in his honor.
</p>
<p>
  The bench is just above the soccer field behind the Oakes Provost House overlooking the UCSC Arboretum, Farm, and Monterey Bay. Thomas, who died in 2004 at age 43, was a 1984 Oakes College graduate.

<p>
  A mountain lion was seen last week near UCSC's Long Marine Laboratory, serving as a reminder that the UCSC campus is situated in mountain lion habitat, and the big cats are occasionally sighted on campus.
</p>
<p>
  Mountain lion safety tips are available here: <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/police/liondoc1.html">www2.ucsc.edu/police/liondoc1.html</a>

<p>
  Additional information about California mountain lions is available from the state Department of Fish and Game at: <a href="http://www.dfg.ca.gov/lion/index.html">www.dfg.ca.gov/lion/index.html</a>
</p>
<p>
  The mountain lion seen last week was observed outside the National Marine Fisheries Service Santa Cruz Laboratory (NOAA Fisheries). Witnesses included a group of about 30 people taking part in a seminar.

        <title>Biologist to discuss nervous system development on Tuesday, May 3</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 25 Apr 2005 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>5683</wp:post_id>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  During the development of the nervous system, billions of nerve cells must grow to the right place at the right time in order to generate elaborate networks of neural connections. Find out how this process is orchestrated from UCSC's Lindsay Hinck, assistant professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology, who will give a talk next week on "Wiring the nervous system from tip to toe: how do neurons go to and fro?"
</p>
<p>
  Hinck's talk, part of the Science & Engineering Library's Synergy Lecture Series, will take place at 4 p.m. on Tuesday, May 3, in the library's Current Periodicals Room. Light refreshments will be available.
</p>
<p>
  Hinck's research focuses on the specialization of cells that create our nervous system. Over one hundred years ago, Spanish scientist Santiago Ramon y Cajal proposed that neurons are guided to targets by diffusible cues in much the same way that white blood cells are guided to wound sites. Only in the last ten years, however, have these cues been identified. Hinck will discuss general features of guidance cues that organize the nervous system and describe her laboratory's investigation into how a neuron knows where to go.
</p>
<p>
  Information on the S&E Library's Synergy Lecture Series is available at <a href="http://library.ucsc.edu/science/synergy">http://library.ucsc.edu/science/synergy</a>.

<p>
  The 2005 Pacific Rim Music Festival--a nine-day international celebration presented by the UCSC Music Department--kicks off on the afternoon of Friday, April 29.
</p>
<p>
  The festivities will begin with a parade and outdoor performance in downtown Santa Cruz by the Korean Folk Percussion Ensemble (Samulnori), a group of 20 performers from Korea. The ensemble will be met at the UCSC campus by percussion ensembles from the Bay Area, as the procession makes its way to the university's arts complex to unite with the UCSC Gamelan Ensembles
</p>
<p>
  Later that evening, San Francisco's Ensemble Parallele will be joined by guest mezzo-soprano Mutsumi Hatano, pipa (lute) virtuoso Wu Man, and violinist Young-Nam Kim for an opening concert, titled <i>Hun Qiao</i> (Bridge of Souls) <i>Remembrance, Reconciliation and Peace</i>--a program created in response to modern wartime atrocities.
</p>
<p>
  Other festival highlights include a celebration of composer Terry Riley's 70th birthday featuring the Kronos Quartet and tabla virtuoso Zakir Hussain at the Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium; and an evening with the Berkeley Symphony conducted by internationally renowned conductor (and UCSC alumnus) Kent Nagano at the Music Center Recital Hall with guest performance by Japan's celebrated pianist Aki Takahashi.
</p>
<p>
  For ticket information, call (831) 459-2159 or go to <a href="mailto:tickets@ucsc.edu">tickets@ucsc.edu</a>. Further information and the concert lineup can be found at the festival web site, <a href="http://pacificrim.ucsc.edu/contact.htm">pacificrim.ucsc.edu/contact.htm</a>l.

<p>
  An effort to move a storage container behind the police station went badly awry on Friday morning when the truck rolled down a steep incline near the main entrance to campus.
</p>
<p>
  The truck turned and came to rest before reaching Coolidge Drive across from the Cook House. There was no driver in the truck when the accident occurred about 10 a.m., police said.
</p>
<p>
  No one was injured in the accident, which drew considerable attention from nearby drivers and pedestrians.
</p>
<p>
  Drip pans were set up quickly at the site to avoid seepage of chemicals, such as transmission fluid, into the soil before the vehicle was towed away.
</p>
<p>
  On its way downhill, the truck struck and destroyed one of the small historic buildings dating to the time before UCSC's arrival, when the land was part of the Cowell Ranch. The building apparently housed at least one skunk, and the area smelled strongly of skunk Friday morning.<br>

<p>
  The science and engineering honors society Sigma Xi has chosen UCSC biologist Martha Zuniga to serve a second year as a Distinguished Lecturer. The Sigma Xi Distinguished Lectureship Program provides opportunities for the society's local chapters to host visits from outstanding individuals who are at the leading edge of science. Zuniga, a professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology, is currently a Distinguished Lecturer for 2004-05 and will continue in this capacity in 2005-06.
</p>
<p>
  Zuniga has already given several talks on the immune system at universities around the country, including Purdue University and Southern Oregon University. These events enable her to meet not only members of the local Sigma Xi societies, but also other members of the local communities, such as high school students and teachers, Zuniga said.
</p>
<p>
  Her research focuses on a key component of the immune system known as class I major histocompatibility complex molecules and their recognition by T lymphocytes during T cell development, as well as during immune responses. Her overall goal is to elucidate the mechanisms by which self-tolerance is attained and maintained normally and how these mechanisms can be modulated in the treatment of autoimmune disease, cancer, and organ transplant rejection.
</p>
<p>
  Zuniga received her B.A. in zoology from the University of Texas at Austin, and her M.Phil. and Ph.D. in biology from Yale University. She received a Presidential Young Investigator Award in 1989 and joined the UCSC faculty in 1990.
</p>
<p>
  Sigma Xi has a membership of 70,000 scientists and engineers in more than 100 countries. The society sponsors a variety of programs, including student research activities and programs that support science and engineering education, public understanding of science, and international research networking.

<p>
  Of the thousands of students who have attended UCSC over the last 40 years, no one knows how many have stayed in the area to become a part of the culture and community of the Central Coast region. But UCSC's 40th anniversary and this weekend's <a href="http://alumni.ucsc.edu/reunions/index.html">Banana Slug Spring Fair</a> seemed like a good time to put out some feelers and see who's around and what they're up to.
</p>
<p>
  Hundreds of alumni returned to UCSC to reminisce and take part in a whirlwind weekend of celebrations during Banana Slug Spring Fair, April 15-17.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Most events--including the All-Alumni Luncheon, the panel discussion featuring Class of 1975 graduates, and the Distinguished Faculty Lecture, took place on Saturday, April 16.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "What a glorious day it was," said Vice Chancellor of University Relations Ronald P. Suduiko. "You could feel the excitement in the air as we celebrated the 40th anniversary of the campus while introducing Chancellor Denton to alumni and friends from around the country."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Dozens of faculty members joined alumni and friends, students and staff members in the celebration.<br>
</p>
<p>
  An overflow crowd of alumni, faculty, and friends attended the Distinguished Faculty Lecture, "Prisonworld: What 25 Years of Overincarceration Has Done to Prisoners and to the Rest of Us," presented by professor of psychology Craig Haney in the University Center's Bhojwani Dining Room.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Another popular event was the Class of 1975 30-Year Reunion Panel Discussion featuring Philip Brookman, Carol Realini, Laurie Garrett, and Gordon Wiltsie.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Several classes and groups held special celebrations, including Black Escargot, UCSC's African American affinity group, which marked its every-five-year reunion with a mentor circle featuring current students; a dinner and dance; and an alumni, faculty, and staff reception.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Visiting reunion classes once again proved generous to their old school, raising $1.7 million for student support and other campus projects.
</p>
<p>
  There was a bittersweet note on Saturday as 120 family members, friends, and colleagues of the late Eric Thomas, former president of the UCSC Alumni Association, attended the dedication of a memorial bench in his honor.
</p>
<p>
  The bench is just above the soccer field behind the Oakes provost house overlooking the UCSC Arboretum and Farm and Monterey Bay. Thomas, who died in 2004 at age 43, was a 1984 Oakes College graduate.

  That was the word at an April 13 forum about the multiyear consolidation and modernization process that includes elimination of 26 service centers. The forum was cosponsored by the Staff Advisory Board and the Business Transformation Program.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "This is about handling our campus today, and handling our campus tomorrow," Tom Vani, vice chancellor for Business and Administrative Services told the gathering at the Music Center Recital Hall.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The initial impetus behind the BTP initiative is to provide basic campus business services with $1.1 million less in annual funding than what has been spent to provide the same services in the past.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Business transformation covers a wide range of services, and will include these changes:<br>
</p>
<p>
  * Purchasing will be streamlined using a system dubbed CruzBuy, with a web-based shopping-cart system familiar to those who shop online.<br>
</p>
<p>
  * The hiring process will be speeded up, allowing applicants to check the status of the hiring process online. An e-mail will be sent to applicants notifying them that their application has been received, and hiring managers will be notified by e-mail when a position has been posted.<br>
</p>
<p>
  * Timesheets will be filled out online, with an option for face-to-face contact in case of problems.<br>
</p>
<p>
  * Policies and procedures will be more consistent, and more consistently applied.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Employees were expected to be notified last week about where they will fit into the new structure, with relocation planned during August. Campus controller Kirk Lew said it does not appear the restructuring will require any layoffs.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The new, centralized offices--which may be located off campus--will be supplemented by a small number of satellite offices on campus, so students, staff, and faculty will be able to access services easily.<br>
</p>
<p>
  While the transformation will bring major changes--and a greater reliance on technology--efforts are being made to retain working relationships.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Under the new structure, a team of employees will serve a group of divisions, with staff members moving to new groupings that include the division they worked with before. "We're trying to maintain a consistency from the former service center system," said Larry Castro, project manager for the Financial Administrative Services Transformation.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The larger units will offer some benefits to staff, such as increased opportunities for internal training and advancement, and more backup available when a staff member is on vacation or on leave.<br>
</p>

<p>
  Hundreds of employees and students picketed at both entrances to UCSC during a one-day UC systemwide strike that occurred this past Thursday (April 14). The strike was called by the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME). Employees on strike, joined by supportive students, staff, and faculty, also organized a noon rally at the base of campus.
</p>
<p>
  The AFSCME service unit includes custodians, food service workers, bus drivers, and groundskeepers. The key issue in the strike was wages.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Late in the afternoon, Chancellor Denton met with several dozen of the protesters at the campus's main entrance. She promised to be a voice for their issues in discussions with UC's senior administration and with state legislators who provide the university's funding base. Chancellor Denton's visit seemed to surprise--and please--the striking workers.
</p>
<p>
  The strike disrupted many scheduled classes and resulted in reduced student services, notably in the areas of child care and dining services. But campus offices remained open.
</p>
<p>
  Information throughout the day was made available on a special <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/strike-afscme_04-05/">strike information web site</a> and on (831) 459-INFO. Traffic information was also transmitted via KZSC Radio.<br>

        <title>Biologist Melissa Jurica earns prestigious grant from Searle Scholars Program</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 18 Apr 2005 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>5667</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_5666" align="alignright" width="170"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/04/jurica2.05-04-18.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-5666" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/04/jurica2.05-04-18.jpg" alt="Melissa Jurica's research focuses on a tiny molecular machine known as the spliceosome." width="170" height="215" /></a>Melissa Jurica's research focuses on a tiny molecular machine known as the spliceosome.[/caption]
<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  The Searle Scholars Program has awarded Melissa Jurica, assistant professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology, a three-year, $240,000 grant to support her research. Jurica, who studies the complex system by which human cells process genetic information, is one of just 15 young scientists awarded the prestigious grants this year.
</p>
<p>
  The Searle Scholars Program makes grants to selected universities and research centers to support the independent research of exceptional young faculty in the biomedical sciences.
</p>
<p>
  This is the first year that UCSC has been invited to participate in the program. Jurica, who joined the UCSC faculty in 2003, is the campus's first Searle Scholar.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Jurica's research focuses on a tiny molecular machine known as the spliceosome, which edits the genetic code before the code gets translated into the protein molecules that carry out a vast range of biological functions.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "It's like when you shoot a movie and you don't need all the footage, you cut some parts out and splice together the parts you want. That's what the spliceosome does with gene sequences," Jurica said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Most people are familiar with the idea of genes as DNA sequences in the chromosomes. The genetic information in a gene is encoded in the sequence of chemical building blocks (As, Cs, Gs, and Ts) in the linear DNA molecule. When a gene is active, its DNA sequence gets copied into an RNA messenger, but the information there isn't actually ready to be used--it needs to be edited before it can direct the synthesis of proteins.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "RNA splicing is absolutely necessary for gene expression, and there are cancers and other diseases associated with problems in splicing," Jurica said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  In some cases, the same gene sequence can be edited in different ways, so that one gene can produce a variety of different protein molecules. This phenomenon, known as "alternative splicing," is especially common in humans. It is the primary explanation for the surprisingly small number of genes scientists have been able to identify in the complete human genome sequence.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The spliceosome is the key to understanding how the body's cells control the process of alternative splicing to ensure that the right protein gets made at the right place and time. But the spliceosome is extraordinarily complex and difficult to study. It is composed of more than 100 different proteins and several different RNA molecules that come together to form a highly dynamic and complicated structure.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The assembled spliceosome is about one millionth of an inch in diameter. Jurica is using several techniques to study the structure of the spliceosome, including electron microscopy and x-ray crystallography. She is also using biochemical techniques to investigate how the spliceosome is assembled from smaller components and how it carries out its functions.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Jurica is affiliated with UCSC's Center for Molecular Biology of RNA, where she is able to consult and collaborate with scientists involved in similar research. For example, Manuel Ares, professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology, studies RNA splicing in yeast, focusing in part on the effects of mutations and environmental changes on the regulation of alternative splicing. Harry Noller, Sinsheimer Professor of Molecular Biology and director of the RNA Center, has used x-ray crystallography to determine the structure of the ribosome, another complex molecular machine, which carries out protein synthesis.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "The collaborative environment of the RNA Center makes it a good place to do structural biology on the spliceosome. There are great structural biologists and splicing experts here," Jurica said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The Searle Scholars Program was established at the Chicago Community Trust in 1980. It is funded from the estates of Mr. and Mrs. John G. Searle. Mr. Searle was the grandson of the founder of the pharmaceutical company G. D. Searle & Company. It was Mr. Searle's wish that certain funds be used to support research in medicine, chemistry, and biology. To achieve this goal, grants are made to selected academic institutions to support the independent research of outstanding individuals who are in the first or second year of their first appointment at the assistant professor level, and whose current appointment is a tenure-track position.<br>

<p>
  Over 25 local, national, and international filmmakers and performing artists will be spotlighted in the 12th annual Women of Color Film and Video Festival, April 22-24 at the Media Theater on campus.
</p>
<p>
  Since 1991, the UCSC Research Cluster for Women of Color has screened more than 300 films, hosted workshops, and presented panel discussions with a wide variety of both established and up-and-coming filmmakers. Sponsored by UCSC's Center for Cultural Studies, the research group is composed of graduate students and faculty engaged in the study of women of color.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The theme of this year's festival is "Disrupting Borders: Seeing Silences and Imagining Trans-Formations." The films range from Anita Wen-Shin Chang's 52-minute film about discovering the political sensibility of her 100-year-old Taiwanese activist grandmother and Nicole Willis's documentary exploring the impact of incarceration on mothers and children in Texas, to <i>Boi Hair,</i> Alma Lopez's documentary short about queer women of color and their short hair, and <i>La Tortilla,</i> a seven-minute short by UCSC alumna Azucena Varela that shows how tortilla makers are sculptors that conjure up the past as they shape maize dough to feed present and future generations.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "They're all very different films--it's a diverse mix of dramas, documentaries, and some comedy," noted Susy Zepeda, codirector of the festival. "We put out a call for films and people responded. There are three films from Mexico, one from Bangladesh, and other submissions from New York, Texas, and Washington State."<br>
</p>
<p>
  "Our goal is to understand what is actually happening in the lives of women of color--to map the territory of where they are today," Zepeda added. "The focus is not just on the negative aspects but also to explore the possibilities for change and transformation."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Zepeda said that the 2005 festival will include panel discussions and four keynote speakers who will discuss why they created their films. Performances of African folk-fusion music, rap, and spoken word will also be presented.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "Most of the filmmakers will be attending the festival," Zepeda noted.
</p>
<p>
  "We're very excited about this opportunity to foster communication and dialogue about women of color."<br>
</p>
<p>
  All events at the Women of Color Film and Video Festival are free and open to the public. Light refreshments will be provided.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_5660" align="alignright" width="150"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/04/long_darrell2.05-04-18.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-5660" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/04/long_darrell2.05-04-18.jpg" alt="Darrell Long has an international reputation as a leader in storage systems research." width="150" height="188" /></a>Darrell Long has an international reputation as a leader in storage systems research.[/caption]
<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  UCSC has appointed Darrell Long, professor of computer science, to the Kumar Malavalli Endowed Chair in Storage Systems. Long is the first faculty member to hold the endowed chair, established in 2004 with a $1 million gift from Kumar Malavalli, cofounder of Brocade Communications and cofounder and CEO of InMage Systems.
</p>
<p>
  Long directs the Storage Systems Research Center (SSRC) at UCSC and also serves as associate dean for research and graduate studies in UCSC's Jack Baskin School of Engineering.
</p>
<p>
  He said the funds from the endowed chair would provide support for research, graduate students, and other activities of the SSRC, a leading center for research on data storage and storage systems.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "I see this endowment as recognition for the excellence of the research conducted by the SSRC as a whole. The center will benefit greatly from having this permanent source of support," Long said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The mission of the SSRC is to improve the performance and profitability of the data storage industry through a strong focus on the software and systems aspects of data storage. Research in the SSRC focuses on caching, storage systems hierarchies, peta-scale storage systems, distributed storage systems, and security and performance.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Data storage technology has come to play a crucial role in modern society, as everything from business information to medical and financial records for individuals is stored on computers and must be available for efficient and secure access. The sheer volume of digital reference data that must be stored and accessed is increasing dramatically. Data storage makes headlines when criminals break into databases and obtain the personal information of thousands of people. But security is just one of many technical challenges in the area of storage systems.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Malavalli has made major contributions in storage systems and storage area networks. He was for many years the chief technical officer of Brocade Communications, the leading provider of storage area networking infrastructure, which he cofounded in 1995. He is also one of the principal architects of Fibre Channel technology, a high-speed data transfer technology used in storage networks. In 2003, Malavalli was inducted into the Silicon Valley Engineering Council Hall of Fame for his contributions to technology.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Long's appointment to the Malavalli Chair is for a five-year term. He has an international reputation as a leader in storage systems research, with more than 120 research publications and numerous patents related to storage systems.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Long has broad research interests in the area of computing systems, including operating systems, distributed systems, high-performance storage systems, fault tolerance, performance evaluation, and mobile computing. His research is supported by the National Science Foundation, the Department of Energy, and other agencies, as well as by various industry partners. He has received an IBM Faculty Award and several IBM Research Invention Achievement Awards.<br>
</p>
<p>
  A senior member of the Computer Society of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), Long served as chair of the society's Technical Committee on Operating Systems and now serves on the Executive Committee. He is a member of the Association for Computing Machinery and serves as chair of the Scholars Committee for the Usenix Association. Long earned a B.S. in computer science from San Diego State University and M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in computer science from UC San Diego. He joined the UCSC faculty in 1988.<br>

</p>
<p>
  All forms of peas and beans, from flowering sweet peas and scarlet runners to edible, climbing, and bush beans, will be available for purchase.
</p>
<p>
  Also new this year will be artichokes--a purple "eat the whole thing" type called <i>Violetto precoce.</i> Fans of flowering currants, which make beautiful and hardy landscape plants, will be delighted by a selection that includes some native coastal species and varieties such as 'Montara Rose' and 'Barrie Coate.' The impressive selection of salvias will include some new types that haven't been offered before, and there will be a fine selection of ever-popular lavenders.<br>
</p>
<p>
  As always, the sale will include more than 200 plant species, including heirloom varieties of tomatoes, as well as hot, mild, and sweet peppers. Six-packs of lettuces, broccoli, cauliflower, and salad mix will also be available.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Sponsored by the Friends of the Farm & Garden and the Center for Agroecology & Sustainable Food Systems, the sale benefits the UCSC Apprenticeship in Ecological Horticulture. Members of the Friends will receive early entry from 9 to 10 a.m. on Saturday only and a 10 percent discount on purchases; memberships will be available at the sale beginning at 8:30 a.m. For more information, call (831) 459-3240.

        <title>New Teacher Center gets $300,000 from Goldman Sachs Foundation</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 18 Apr 2005 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  The pace of growth and expansion at the UCSC New Teacher Center will accelerate thanks to a $300,000 grant from the Goldman Sachs Foundation.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The funding will bolster the center's organizational infrastructure and support the rapid growth of the New Teacher Center (NTC), which leads the nation in the development of support programs for new teachers. Since opening in 1998, the NTC has become a national resource for teacher training.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Research shows that teacher quality is the most important variable in student performance, and the NTC provides support during the critical first two years of a new teacher's career. The NTC model pairs beginning teachers with carefully selected veteran teachers, who are trained to become skillful "teachers of teachers." This infusion of support has resulted in substantial decreases in teacher attrition.<br>
</p>
<p>
  NTC works with school districts, universities, policy makers, and educational leaders in more than 30 states to create support systems for new teachers and principals. Services include consultation, professional development, research, program evaluation, and product development.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The Goldman Sachs Foundation awarded grants to several educational organizations that support innovative programs in youth development, business education, and teacher development.

<p>
  A film by two UCSC undergraduates about trailblazing Mexican American journalist Ruben Salazar will be screened during the <a href="http://www.reelwork.org/index.htm">Fourth Annual Reel Work May Day Labor Film Festival</a> April 24-May 1, in Santa Cruz.
</p>
<p>
  Filmmakers Leilani Montes and Victoria Fong collaborated on the 15-minute documentary <i>Since Salazar.</i> The film is a tribute to Salazar, whose reporting for the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> and KMEX-TV 34 established him as an influential voice for the Mexican American community in California until his untimely death in 1970.
</p>
<p>
  Salazar was covering the Chicano anti-Vietnam War moratorium in East Los Angeles when he was killed by a tear gas projectile fired by a sheriff's deputy. <i>Since Salazar</i> is among the films that will be screened Wednesday, April 27, beginning at 7 p.m. in the Kresge Town Hall on the UCSC campus.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The Reel Work May Day Labor Film Festival began in 2002 to increase awareness of the labor movement. Each year, the festival presents a mix of rare and well-known critically acclaimed films, with screenings on campus and at several community venues. A <a href="http://www.reelwork.org/schedule2005.htm">full schedule is available</a>. Admission to all events is by donation.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Major festival cosponsors include the UCSC Community Studies Department, Community Television of Santa Cruz County, the Nickelodeon Theatre, Community Printers (represented by GCIU Local 388), and the Monterey Bay Central Labor Council, AFL-CIO.

<p>
  Morteza Shahram, a graduate student in electrical engineering, was selected as a winner of the student paper contest at a major international conference. Shahram's paper was chosen in the category of Signal Processing Theory and Methods at the 2005 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing, held in Philadelphia last month. (IEEE is the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.)
</p>
<p>
  "This meeting is the premier signal processing conference in the world, so this is a very nice recognition of Morteza's work," said Peyman Milanfar, associate professor of electrical engineering and Shahram's adviser.
</p>
<p>
  Milanfar directs the Multidimensional Signal Processing Research Group at UCSC. Shahram's winning paper is entitled "Improved Spectral Analysis of Nearby Tones Using Local Detectors."<br>

<p>
  UCSC will kick off its inaugural Arboretum Music Series on Thursday, April 21, with a concert by singer/songwriter Keith Greeninger, plus Dayan Kai and Band, at the new Arboretum Amphitheater off Empire Grade in Santa Cruz.
</p>
<p>
  The Marie Beckham Arboretum Music Series, will present folk, classical, cultural, and jazz performers on the third Thursdays of the month from April through September. Performers this year include tenor saxophonist Dave Ellis, Hawaiian slack key guitarist Patrick Landeza, Linda Tillery & The Cultural Heritage Choir, the Cypress String Quartet, and the Chicano folk-fusion band, Quetzal.
</p>
<p>
  "It's a beautiful setting," said Stephen McCabe, coordinator of research and education for the Arboretum. "With the abundant rain this year, the Arboretum's flowers are outstanding this spring. Patrons will walk past or take a wagon shuttle by the flowering gardens to get to the outdoor amphitheater."<br>
</p>
<p>
  McCabe added that the concert series is named in honor of Marie Beckham "who has been tirelessly volunteering in many capacities at the Arboretum for the last 30 years, and has previously helped bring concerts to other venues in the Arboretum."<br>
</p>
<p>
  The 2005 lineup:<br>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Thursday, April 21--Keith Greeninger plus Dayan Kai and Band</b><br>
</p>
<p>
  Singer/songwriter Keith Greeninger has drawn comparisons to Jackson Browne and Bruce Cockburn for the soulfulness and imagery of his phrasing and the power of his voice. He first started gaining attention on the national music scene in 1989 as a principal songwriter, guitarist, and vocalist for the groundbreaking trio City Folk. The group was known for its powerful lyrics, harmony, and instrumental virtuosity, and quickly became one of the prominent new folk acts in northern California.
</p>
<p>
  Greeninger has just put the finishing touches on his second album, <i>Back to You,</i> on which he is joined by local Santa Cruz favorite, Water. Doors open at 5:15 p.m.; the show starts at 6:15 p.m. Tickets are $10 in advance, $12 at the door, Arboretum members, $10.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Thursday, May 19--Linda Tillery & The Cultural Heritage Choir</b><br>
</p>
<p>
  In 1992, Linda Tillery came across a treasure trove of field recordings of traditional African American music. Within months she had assembled the Cultural Heritage Choir, a six-member ensemble to perform spirituals, work and play songs, field hollers, and other slave songs in the folk tradition. The group is one of the vital performing ensembles in its field, bringing traditional forms of African American culture to the stage. In addition to songs and chants, delivered through such stylistic forms as call-and-response, multilayered harmonies, and repetitive verse, the CHC repertoire includes intoned sermons, folk tales, polyrhythmic percussion, and dance.<br>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Thursday, June 16--The Cypress Quartet</b><br>
</p>
<p>
  Founded in 1996 in San Francisco, the Cypress String Quartet has performed to great acclaim at prominent venues worldwide, playing sold-out concerts at the Kennedy Center, the Ravinia Festival, and Stanford Lively Arts. Praised by the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> for their "musical astuteness and virtuoso resources," quartet members Cecily Ward, Tom Stone, Ethan Filner, and Jennifer Kloetzel strive to reach a large and diverse audience through an extensive touring schedule and an array of innovative education and outreach programs. The quartet is also widely known as a champion of American music. Having commissioned and performed 10 original works by leading American composers, the Cypress recently won an Aaron Copland Award.<br>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Thursday, July 21--Quetzal</b><br>
</p>
<p>
  From Los Angeles, Quetzal has built a strong reputation as a catalyst for Chicano/Latino music. Blending a variety of music traditions--including son, vera cruz, rock 'n' roll, and traditional Mexican ballads--Quetzal has created a new music scene reflecting the diverse mix of Mexican sounds in the United States. In the past several years, the six-member group has toured extensively with artists such as Taj Mahal, Ozomatli, and Los Lobos. The group also has two full-length albums to its credit, the self-titled <i>Quetzal</i> and the 2003 release <i>Sing The Real,</i> produced by Los Lobos' Steve Berlin.<br>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Thursday, August 18th--Dave Ellis Trio</b>
</p>
<p>
  Tenor saxophonist Dave Ellis was named Best New Talent (along with Diana Krall) in the 1997 <i>Jazziz</i> magazine Readers Poll. In 1992, Ellis became a pioneer in California's nascent "new jazz" movement, teaming up with eight-string guitarist Charlie Hunter and drummer Jay Lane to form the immensely popular Charlie Hunter Trio. After recording for Les Claypool's Prawn Song label, the trio signed to Blue Note, which brought them national attention. <i>State of Mind,</i> his debut recording for Milestone, has received international acclaim and was selected as the 2004 California Music Award for Outstanding Jazz Album of the Year.<br>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Thursday, September 15--Patrick Landeza</b><br>
  <br>
  Patrick Landeza is considered to be a leading performer of Hawaiian slack key guitar, or ki ho'alu, one of the world's great acoustic guitar traditions. His career highlights include becoming the first slack key artist to perform the national anthem at a major league baseball game and opening for legendary Hawaiian musicians Israel "Bruddah Iz" Kamakawiwo'ole, Keali'i Reichel, and HAPA. Noted pianist and ki ho'alu player George Winston says "Patrick Landeza is one of the best and most dedicated of the new generation of slack key players."<br>

<p>
  Each quarter, the Humanities Division's Living Writers Series brings eight to 10 visiting authors and poets into UCSC classes to give students an in-depth look into the world of the working writer.
</p>
<p>
  Sponsored by the campus's Institute for Humanities Research and the Porter College Hitchcock Poetry Fund, the series is coordinated by associate professors of literature Micah Perks and Karen Yamashita, codirectors of the UCSC Creative Writing Program.
</p>
<p>
  "Our primary goal is to bring in people whose work we think will reach the students and broaden their horizons," said Perks.
</p>
<p>
  "We really try to bring a large variety of writers--people just starting out, those who have been around a long time, older people, younger people--to give students a sense of what's possible in the writing life and how the choices they make will affect their lives and work."
</p>
<p>
  The spring 2005 schedule will include guests such as Vietnamese American writer Linh Dinh, novelist Stephen Elliott, and poet Elizabeth Willis. It will also feature visits by Patricia Wakida, an editor at Heyday Press in Berkeley, and Larry Siems, director of the "Freedom to Write" international program of the PEN American Center in New York City.
</p>
<p>
  "I wanted to bring Larry in because I think he's an ideal person to talk about censorship issues and how writing can be dangerous," Yamashita noted. "I always want students to think about the integrity of their work and the consequences of their writing. And we're bringing in Patricia especially for students in the Senior Fiction Project--to give them an idea of what it's like to be an editor in the publishing industry and to point them in other directions related to writing."
</p>
<p>
  Yamashita added that one of the benefits of the Living Writers Series is to help create a network in the publishing industry and to facilitate contacts for internships.
</p>
<p>
  "Another guest this quarter will be Susan McCloskey, one of our very talented former students who is now the buyer for fiction at Bookshop Santa Cruz," Yamashita said. "She'll talk about what it's like to work in a bookshop--the process, the ins and outs of promotion, how she selects books. We're trying to show students there's a world out there that they might not be aware of; it's a way of informing them about possibilities."
</p>
<p>
  Both Perks and Yamashita are themselves highly accomplished writers. Perks's first published short story, in <i>Epoch</i> magazine, was nominated for the prestigious Pushcart Prize. She has written a memoir, <i>Pagan Time: An American Childhood</i> (2001); a novel of historic fiction, <i>We Are Gathered Here</i> (1996); as well as a variety of short stories that have appeared in numerous anthologies and literary magazines.
</p>
<p>
  Yamashita is the author of <i>Through the Arc of the Rain Forest</i> (1990), which received the American Book Award, and <i>Brazil-Maru,</i> named by the Village Voice as one of the 25 best books of 1992. Her third novel, <i>Tropic of Orange</i> (1997), was a finalist for the Paterson Fiction Prize, and she followed that with <i>Circle K Cycles</i> (2001), a book based on her research on the Brazilian community in Japan.
</p>
<p>
  Perks said that the Living Writers Series has particularly struck a chord with advanced students in the Creative Writing Program.
</p>
<p>
  "The students benefit by learning how real working writers live, rather than the 10 percent who actually make a living from creative writing every year," she observed.<br>

<p>
  Two hundred high school seniors who have been admitted to UCSC--but have yet to make a final decision--have a lot to think about following a whirlwind campus visit hosted by three UCSC student-initiated outreach programs.
</p>
<p>
  High school students from around the state were invited to visit the campus April 7-9, and the student outreach volunteers worked with the Admissions Office to give the students a taste of campus life.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The three student outreach groups are Destination Higher Education, organized by the African/Black Student Alliance; A Step Forward, run by the Filipino Student Association; and ORALE, or Oportunidades Rumbo A La Educacion, presented by Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano/a de Aztlan (MEChA).<br>
</p>
<p>
  Admissions Director Kevin Browne said such visits to campus are crucial as students decide where to enroll.
</p>
<p>
  "These programs get the students to the campus, where they can make a clear distinction between their perception of the campus and reality," Browne said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The visit included workshops on such nuts-and-bolts topics as financial aid and academic support as well as a chance to get acquainted with the different ethnic groups that are part of life at UCSC. A highlight of the students' trip was a "collaborative dinner," with salsa dancing and hip-hop music presented by the student organizations as well as a performance by the multicultural Rainbow Theater.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Chancellor Denice D. Denton welcomed the students to campus, sharing with them her commitment to diversity and educational access. Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Francisco Hernandez hosted them the next day at a barbecue lunch at the Merrill Multipurpose Room.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Outreach volunteer Ray Austin with A Step Forward knows first-hand the impact such efforts can have. He said he was planning to attend a private college until he came to UCSC as part of the A Step Forward outreach program two years ago. "Not many students at other schools would do this," said Austin, now a second-year student at Oakes active in A Step Forward. "You know the admissions office wants you, but here the students are welcoming--that's what really drew me."
</p>
<p>
  Austin said the UCSC volunteers include both students who participated in student outreach programs as high school students and those who did not.<br>

        <title>Peregrine falcons released to the wild at Long Marine Laboratory</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 11 Apr 2005 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>5641</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_5640" align="alignright" width="230"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/04/falcon_inside.05-04-11.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-5640" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/04/falcon_inside.05-04-11.jpg" alt="These young peregrine falcons were released at Long Marine Laboratory in April 2003.

<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  For the next few weeks, visitors to UCSC's Long Marine Laboratory will have the rare opportunity to see young peregrine falcons learning to fly and hunt in the wild.
</p>
<p>
  The six-week-old falcons were raised in a captive breeding program and are now being released to the wild by the Santa Cruz Predatory Bird Research Group (SCPBRG), which is affiliated with the Institute of Marine Sciences and based at Long Marine Lab.
</p>
<p>
  Glenn Stewart, SCPBRG program manager, said the release is a six- to eight-week process during which the group's staff and volunteers will be keeping an eye on the birds and providing them with food at the release site until they are able to capture prey on their own. In the wild, peregrine falcon parents provide food for their young during this stage, but the young birds do not learn their hunting skills from their parents, Stewart said.
</p>
<p>
  "It's a completely instinctive activity. They will soon be dominating the air space around the lab and chasing other birds as they begin to learn pursuit skills--it's quite an impressive aerial display to observe," he said. The three falcon siblings, two males and a female, were five weeks old when Stewart brought them to Long Marine Lab last week and put them in a specially-built box (called a "hack box") set up on a third-floor landing of the Center for Ocean Health building. Today (Monday), Stewart will open the box to allow the birds to take their first flights (known as fledging).
</p>
<p>
  The fledglings can be a bit clumsy at first and often land on the ground after their first flight. This is the most dangerous time for the birds, but Long Marine Lab is a very forgiving location, Stewart said.
</p>
<p>
  "In other locations, we have to worry about coyotes or bobcats getting them when they land on the ground. But even here we need to make sure they get back to a safe perch before nightfall, so we'll have people out there every daylight hour to monitor them for the next two months," he said.
</p>
<p>
  The birds have been outfitted with small radio transmitters to enable the researchers to keep track of them during the release process. The volunteers helping to monitor the birds at Long Marine Lab include six student interns from UCSC and Cabrillo College who are receiving course credits for their work with SCPBRG.
</p>
<p>
  This is the third year in a row that Long Marine Lab has served as a release site for peregrine falcons. Stewart said the falcons typically use the whole lab area as a home base and can often be seen perching on the roofs of the buildings and flying overhead. Until they begin catching their own prey, the falcons usually return to the hack box once a day to eat the fresh quail the attendants leave there.
</p>
<p>
  SCPBRG biologists have released more than 1,000 peregrine falcons into the wild since the 1970s, helping to bring the species back from the brink of extinction. Their release method, known as "hacking," is based on an old falconry technique. A detailed description can be found on the <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/scpbrg/hacksite.htm">group's web site</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The releases at Long Marine Lab are being carried out under a contract with Caltrans as mitigation for the potential disturbance of nesting peregrines during seismic retrofitting work on the San Francisco Bay Bridge and other bridges.
</p>
<p>
  The SCPBRG is dedicated to the recovery of endangered predatory birds and applies its expertise to a wide range of bird species. The organization's work is entirely supported by foundation grants, gifts from individuals, and contracts awarded by state and federal agencies.<br>

        <title>Digital divide project finds evidence that computers at home improve high school graduation rates</title>

<p>
  Children living in homes with a computer are more likely to graduate from high school than young adults without computer access at home, even when factors like income and parental education are controlled for, according to UCSC researchers investigating the "digital divide."
</p>
<p>
  Although many studies have explored the impact of computers in schools, and the federal government has made computer access in schools a priority, very few studies have assessed the impact on youth of having a computer in the home, said Robert Fairlie, associate professor of economics at UCSC and one of the lead investigators on the project.
</p>
<p>
  The subject warrants study because 20 million children in the United States, or 26 percent of children, have no computer access at home, which could contribute to the nation's persistent racial disparities in access to computer technology--the so-called "digital divide," said Fairlie.
</p>
<p>
  Using sophisticated econometrics to analyze two large national data sets, Fairlie and his research team sought to identify "spurious correlations" and isolate the impacts of home computers. They controlled for numerous factors, including income, education, race, and family motivation on educational outcomes.
</p>
<p>
  Fairlie's team documented a 6 percent to 8 percent increase in the high school graduation rate of youth in homes with computers. Other positive impacts include a lower rate of school suspensions and overall higher grade-point averages among students in homes with computers.
</p>
<p>
  Fairlie is one of four UCSC researchers conducting an ambitious investigation of the digital divide under the auspices of the Center for Justice, Tolerance, and Community (CJTC). Affiliates discussed the project during a lunch-hour presentation last week entitled "Race, Youth, and the Digital Divide."
</p>
<p>
  More than 60 percent of homes in the United States have a computer, and Internet access is available in more than 50 percent of homes, said Manuel Pastor, a professor of Latin American and Latino studies. Less than 20 percent of homes have broadband Internet access, however.
</p>
<p>
  The "digital divide" appears when the racial makeup of those homes is examined, explained Pastor. About 70 percent of Asian and Anglo homes have computers, compared with about 45 percent of African American and Latino households. Internet access reflects a similar gap.
</p>
<p>
  Racial differences persist in broadband service, with more than 30 percent of Asian households having broadband, compared with about 20 percent of Anglo homes, and only about 10 percent of African American and Latino households, according to Pastor.
</p>
<p>
  "Very sharp disparities are going unemphasized by the latest government report on computer and Internet access, 'A Nation Online,'" said Pastor. "Race, education, income, and language matter."
</p>
<p>
  In previous work, Fairlie has found that racial disparities in access to computers at home are highest among the age group 8-25. "These patterns are particularly troubling in light of the presumption that information technology is a new prerequisite for success in the labor market," said Fairlie, a labor economist who specializes in minority entrepreneurship.
</p>
<p>
  To further explore the value of computer and Internet access for youth, the project is conducting in-depth qualitative research at five community technology centers (CTCs) around the country. The findings will shed light on how CTCs transform youth and communities, said CJTC associate researcher Rachel Rosner.
</p>
<p>
  The five CTCs being evaluated have diverse goals and programs, from a rural drop-in center in California's Central Valley to a sophisticated Harlem-based web publishing operation run entirely by high school students, noted Rebecca London, an associate research professor at CJTC who is taking the lead on the qualitative part of the project. Yet each facility helps young people gain the technology-related skills they need while learning to interact with adults and within an organization, she said.
</p>
<p>
  "The centers provide needed access to computers by filling gaps that exist at school and home," said London. "Each center has a particular role in the neighborhood, and they build networks that help youth in other aspects of their lives."
</p>
<p>
  London's qualitative research on community technology centers, which represent an important access point for low-income youth, provides insights into how technology changes the lives of youths, especially in education. Her research, in particular, attempts to open the "black box" of how and why access to technology has effects on educational outcomes as found in the quantitative research.
</p>
<p>
  The long-term goal of the project is to generate high-quality research findings that can shape the policy debate over how to "bridge" the digital divide. The project has funding from the W. T. Grant Foundation and the Community Technology Foundation of California.<br>

<p>
  Shakespeare Santa Cruz artistic director Paul Whitworth is featured in the new West End and New York hit play <i>Blue/Orange,</i> running through May 15 at the Aurora Theatre in Berkeley.
</p>
<p>
  Called a "ferocious comedy, with dialogue fueled by testosterone and paced like a volley of bullets" by the <i>New York Times</i>, this incendiary tale, set in a London psychiatric hospital, follows a young man brazenly claiming to be the son of exiled African dictator Idi Amin, and the two rival psychiatrists who fight over his diagnosis and treatment. Whitworth is cast as Robert, a pompous psychiatrist.
</p>
<p>
  A sharply observed, irreverently funny social critique that examines society's obsession with class, race, and madness, the play is a winner of England's coveted Olivier Award for Best New Play, the <i>Evening Standard</i> Best Play of the Year, and the Critics Circle Award for Best New Play. For information or tickets, call (510) 843-4822 or visit <a href="http://auroratheatre.org">auroratheatre.org</a>.

        <title>Seymour Center to receive funding from surf industry</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 11 Apr 2005 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>

        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  For the third year in a row, the Surf Industry Manufacturers Association (SIMA) will provide a grant to support education programs at UCSC's Seymour Marine Discovery Center. The Seymour Center is one of 10 environmental organizations chosen by SIMA to receive proceeds from the Waterman's Weekend, the surf industry's annual environmental fundraiser.
</p>
<p>
  The SIMA Environmental Fund provides grants to environmental organizations based on their commitment to specific projects that will protect and preserve oceans, beaches, or surf breaks. The Seymour Center will use the funds from SIMA to educate young people about the role marine science plays in understanding and conserving the world's oceans.
</p>
<p>
  The exact amount of the grant depends on the funds raised during the Waterman's Weekend. Last year, the Seymour Center received over $12,000 from the SIMA Environmental Fund.
</p>
<p>
  The annual Waterman's Weekend serves as the primary fundraiser for the SIMA Environmental Fund through the Waterman's Classic Golf Tournament and Waterman's Ball and Auction. This year's Waterman's Classic will take place August 26 at the Monarch Beach Golf Links. The Waterman's Ball and Auction will be held August 27 at the St. Regis Monarch Beach Resort & Spa in Dana Point, California.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  UCSC has been named one of the "Top 25 Colleges for Latinos" by <a href="http://www.hispaniconline.com/magazine/"><i>Hispanic Magazine</i></a> in its March 2005 issue.
</p>
<p>
  "Natural beauty, academic freedom and accessible professors draw students to the UCSC," the magazine article said. "Students have the opportunity to create documentaries on 9/11 as assignments, to coauthor research with professors, and to sign up for classes, such as Muppet Magic, about the history of Jim Henson and the Muppets."
</p>
<p>
  UCSC was ranked number 23 in the magazine's annual list. The ranking is based on the number of academic degrees awarded to Hispanics, and academic quality as rated by U.S. News & World Report' s annual edition of America's Best Colleges. Colleges listed also needed to have a Hispanic enrollment of at least seven percent.

<p>
  The UCSC Arboretum will hold its annual Spring Plant Sale on Saturday, April 16, from noon to 4 p.m. Spring is always a great time to visit the Arboretum, now celebrating its 40th anniversary, and pick out some favorite plants while the gardens are in full bloom. The plant sale will take place at the Arboretum's Eucalyptus Grove on High Street near the intersection with Western Drive.
</p>
<p>
  A wide variety of native and exotic plants will be available at the sale, including attractive selections of <i>Grevillea</i>, manzanita, pincushion protea, <i>Salvia</i>, succulents, and tea tree. Knowledgeable Arboretum staff and volunteers will be on hand to answer questions.
</p>
<p>
  The Arboretum's sale is held in conjunction with the spring plant sale of the California Native Plant Society. Both sales are open early (from 10 a.m. to noon) to members of the Arboretum Associates and the California Native Plant Society, and to the general public from noon to 4 p.m.
</p>
<p>
  A complete list of the plants available at the Arboretum sale is posted on the group's web site, <a href="http://arboretum.ucsc.edu">arboretum.ucsc.edu</a>. A few of the many plants that will be available are described below.
</p>
<p>
  <i>Banksia spinulosa</i> 'Red Rock' is a selection with exceptionally large, golden 6- to 8-inch long flowerheads that are well displayed among the linear serrated leaves. This shrub grows 8 feet tall and about as wide. It is best grown in well-drained acidic soils in partial or full sun. There will also be other banksias for sale, including <i>Banksia baxteri</i>.
</p>
<p>
  No garden is complete without <i>Leptospermum</i> 'Queen of Hearts', a hybrid created by the Arboretum's founding director, Ray Collett. This is a low-growing, spreading plant with profuse 1-inch open white flowers with reddish sepals. The flowers smell like butter and cinnamon. <i>Leptospermum turbinatum,</i> the Grampians tea tree, is a larger shrub with shiny elliptical leaves and white-to-cream blossoms.
</p>
<p>
  Other plants from the Australian collection include many different flower colors of <i>Anigozanthus flavidus</i> (kangaroo paws), <i>Patersonia glabrata</i>, and <i>Adenanthos sericea</i>. From the South African collection, look for <i>Leucospermum cordifolium</i> 'Yellow Bird' and others.
</p>
<p>
  California natives available from the Arboretum will include <i>Romneya coulteri,</i> the Matilija poppy, with its gigantic white flowers with yellow centers. Two low ground covers, <i>Arctostaphylos edmundsii</i> 'Little Sur' and <i>Ceanothus hearstiorum</i> will be available. For a large shrub, try <i>Malosma laurina</i> (laurel sumac) and enjoy its aromatic leaves and clouds of tiny white flowers in early summer. The Arboretum will also be selling <i>Dudleya viscida</i>, a native succulent that makes a nice addition to a rock garden. This plant is rarely for sale, except at the Arboretum and one or two specialty nurseries. <i>Dudleya viscida</i> is a narrow endemic from southern California that has open pink flowers on compact inflorescences and fragrant, shiny lime-green leaves.
</p>
<p>
  For more information about the sale, contact the UCSC Arboretum at (831) 427-2998. The Arboretum is open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. every day. Norrie's Gifts is open daily from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.

<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  The Jack Baskin School of Engineering has honored three faculty members with FIRST Professor Awards in recognition of their achievements in research, teaching, and service. Ali Shakouri, associate professor of electrical engineering, received the Senior FIRST Professor Award. Junior FIRST Professor Awards went to Herbert Lee, assistant professor of applied mathematics and statistics, and James Whitehead, assistant professor of computer science.
</p>
<p>
  Engineering dean Steve Kang established the FIRST Awards to recognize faculty who are role models for achieving the goals he has expressed as "Frontier Impacting through excellence in Research, Service, and Teaching" (FIRST). The Senior FIRST Professor receives $10,000 per year in discretionary funds for two years, and each of the two Junior FIRST Professors receive $2,500 per year for two years.
</p>
<p>
  Nominees for the awards were submitted by each department and reviewed by a selection committee composed of all the department chairs in the engineering school. Ira Pohl, professor of computer science and chair of the selection committee, said the Junior award was divided between Lee and Whitehead because they were both considered extremely worthy of recognition.

<p>
  Of the thousands of students who have attended UCSC over the last 40 years, no one knows how many have stayed in the area to become a part of the culture and community of the Central Coast region. But UCSC's 40th anniversary and this weekend's <a href="http://alumni.ucsc.edu/reunions/index.html">Banana Slug Spring Fair</a> seemed like a good time to put out some feelers and see who's around and what they're up to.
</p>
<p>
  By no means comprehensive, the following is an informal attempt to bring us all up to speed about the ways in which UCSC grads are helping make Santa Cruz the special place it is.
</p>
<p>
  One caveat: For the most part, you won't see the names of UCSC staff, instructors, and faculty. We know you're out there, but the focus this time is off campus.

<p>
  Of the thousands of students who have attended UCSC over the last 40 years, no one knows how many have stayed in the area to become a part of the culture and community of the Central Coast region. But UCSC's 40th anniversary and this weekend's <a href="http://alumni.ucsc.edu/reunions/index.html">Banana Slug Spring Fair</a> seemed like a good time to put out some feelers and see who's around and what they're up to.
</p>
<p>
  By no means comprehensive, the following is an informal attempt to bring us all up to speed about the ways in which UCSC grads are helping make Santa Cruz the special place it is.
</p>
<p>
  One caveat: For the most part, you won't see the names of UCSC staff, instructors, and faculty. We know you're out there, but the focus this time is off campus.

<p>
  Erika Zavaleta, an assistant professor of environmental studies at UCSC, has received a prestigious grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation to investigate the ecological impacts of the loss of plant species in California ecosystems.
</p>
<p>
  Through a program that supports the research projects of outstanding junior faculty, Zavaleta has been awarded a three-year, $200,000 grant. A maximum of only three such awards are presented each year.
</p>
<p>
  Zavaleta, who joined the UCSC faculty in 2003, conducts research on the ecological impacts of biodiversity change. She is particularly interested in understanding the ecosystem effects of a decline in the number of plant species, including impacts on nutrient cycling and retention, productivity, and community and ecosystem resilience.
</p>
<p>
  The grant will support observational field research and an experimental study of the effects of removing vulnerable species from two key ecosystems: vernal pool and grassland habitats in central California.
</p>
<p>
  Zavaleta's work fills a gap that persists because most studies on the ecology of species decline and extinction have focused on vertebrate animals, not plants.
</p>
<p>
  "Despite the fact that plant species are declining and disappearing at an alarming rate around the world, we have only a marginal understanding of the ecological consequences of these declines," said Zavaleta, who described California as "a global hotspot for threatened plant diversity."
</p>
<p>
  Zavaleta's project will focus on non-random loss of rare and vulnerable plants.
</p>
<p>
  "Most species in ecosystems, and most at-risk species, are relatively uncommon," said Zavaleta. "They exert what influence they have in relatively small numbers."
</p>
<p>
  In a pilot study in 2003-04, Zavaleta found that losses of even very rare species have a large impact on ecosystem productivity, colonization by other species, and water consumption. Her finding that declining biodiversity greatly reduced resistance to invasive species has important implications for resource managers. The new grant will enable Zavaleta to improve and expand on the pilot study to explore the mechanisms underlying the documented effects.
</p>
<p>
  The observational study will compare approximately 500 currently threatened plant species and their nonthreatened relatives to explore whether they possess, as a group, unique or distinct characteristics, such as size, structure, life history, and defenses. "This will be the first phylogenetically controlled study of plant species vulnerability that we know of," said Zavaleta.
</p>
<p>
  In the experimental study, Zavaleta will manipulate a small number of species in a single type of ecosystem to measure the ecological consequences of removing or reducing species. UCSC doctoral candidate Kristin B. Hulvey and a postdoctoral researcher will collaborate with Zavaleta, who will also work with colleagues at other universities.<br>

        <title>UCSC to lead ambitious multidisciplinary research project on wireless communication networks</title>

<p>
  UCSC researchers are leading a major collaborative effort to develop the technology for complex wireless communication networks that can be set up in rapidly changing environments such as battlefields and emergency situations.
</p>
<p>
  Faculty in UCSC's Baskin School of Engineering will head a multidisciplinary team of scientists at seven major universities working on the Dynamic Ad-hoc Wireless Networks (DAWN) project.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The project also includes researchers at UC Berkeley, UCLA, Stanford University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), the University of Maryland, and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC).
</p>
<p>
  It is funded by a five-year grant from the U.S. Department of Defense that will provide an average of $1 million per year spread among the seven institutions.<br>
</p>
<p>
  J. J. Garcia-Luna-Aceves, Jack Baskin Professor of Computer Engineering at UCSC and the principal investigator on the DAWN project, said the methods and protocols developed for this project will have widespread applications. The research is of particular interest to the U.S. Army to enable troops to deploy mobile communications networks on the battlefield. But such networks could also be used by emergency personnel in the aftermath of an earthquake or other disaster in which pre-existing communications infrastructure has been knocked out.
</p>
<p>
  In addition, mobile and adaptable wireless networking may find more commonplace applications in the increasingly wireless world of modern communications.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "Even today, with the widespread use of wireless technology, little is understood about how wireless networks can scale up and become part of the Internet at large. We really need to develop a science of wireless networking," Garcia-Luna-Aceves said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The DAWN project aims to establish the fundamental principles, tools, and methodologies needed to design reliable and efficient wireless networks. So far, the methods that have been applied in wireless networks have been derived from the wired world, Garcia-Luna-Aceves said. But ad-hoc wireless networks are complex systems with interactions and dynamics that do not occur in wired networks.<br>
</p>
<p>
  An ad-hoc wireless network is a self-organizing system of wireless devices in which individual nodes may move randomly and organize themselves into an unpredictable and rapidly changing network. The impact of a wireless transmission is not confined to a stable set of point-to-point links, as in a wired network, but reaches any receiver within its range. Interference at a receiver is a complex function of the characteristics of the wireless devices and the terrain or physical environment in which they are operating.<br>

  "We need a mathematical framework that will allow us to model the more complex world of the wireless environment. In the past, we have made many assumptions just to make the modeling tractable, but now we will be pushing the envelope," Garcia-Luna-Aceves said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Garcia-Luna-Aceves has been working in the area of wireless networking for many years and has led several successful projects to develop small-scale mobile wireless networks. The DAWN project is an interdisciplinary effort to advance this research to a larger scale. By developing an understanding of how large-scale wireless networks operate, the project will lay the foundation for greater accessibility to the Internet, Garcia-Luna-Aceves said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "For the Internet to become more pervasive, people need to have access wherever they are. Wireless networking will enable the Internet to be even more useful than it is today," he said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The DAWN team includes some of the top researchers in the field of networking, and Garcia-Luna-Aceves noted that UCSC's leadership of the project is indicative of the campus's stature in the field.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "We are leading the best universities in the field on this project, and I think that's a recognition that UCSC is doing first-rate research in networking," Garcia-Luna-Aceves said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  In addition to Garcia-Luna-Aceves, the UCSC faculty involved in the project include Katia Obraczka, associate professor of computer engineering, and Hamid Sadjadpour, assistant professor of electrical engineering. Other major contributors include Tony Ephremides at the University of Maryland, Andrea Goldsmith at Stanford, Jennifer Hou and Nitin Vaidya at UIUC, Mario Gerla and Rajive Bagrodia at UCLA, Muriel Medard at MIT, and Pravin Varaiya at UC Berkeley.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The DAWN grant is one of 33 research grants awarded this year under the Multidisciplinary University Research Initiative (MURI) program. The grant will provide support for 19 graduate students, including at least four at UCSC. Industry collaborations will provide additional support for students through summer internships.<br>

<p>
  Innovative, kinetic, and sonic installations merging sculpture, electronic media, and performance art will be on display in <i>Faculty Works: 2005</i> at UCSC's Sesnon Gallery. The exhibit, from April 6 to May 7, will feature works by three new art faculty members: Dee Hibbert-Jones, Ed Osborn, and Jennifer Parker.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Dee Hibbert-Jones</b> was recently hired as an assistant professor to develop the public art program at UCSC.
</p>
<p>
  Her current research explores the relationships between art, commerce, and mental health in a project she calls "Psychological Prosthetics." In collaboration with mental health workers, she has created (and patented) a brand of sculptural products designed to aid mental health disorders. The products employ sleek, high-tech designs with gadgetry attached such as LCD monitors, push-buttons for audio, and telescoping sections for portability.
</p>
<p>
  Hibbert-Jones's creations include a <i>Separation Anxiety Disorder Teddy Backpack</i> and an <i>Attention Deficit Disorder Brace.</i> She has also constructed a <i>Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Security Vest</i>--complete with an LCD screen to cathartically retell a personal trauma story, a stress gauge connected to body temperature, and a walkie-talkie check-in device to monitor personal safety.
</p>
<p>
  "Sculpture is an emotion made tangible," Hibbert-Jones explained. "I'm exploring the role of the artist as healer by creating a tangible product to soothe a mental health disorder. If someone is having an anxiety attack, I can give them something to hold or wear like a security blanket. I look at ideas like: 'How do you create an environment that creates an emotional response of safety?' or 'What kinds of things help?'"
</p>
<p>
  Hibbert-Jones said she conceived her project while reflecting on the massive influence of the psycho-pharmaceutical industry. The presentation of her products mimics a corporate display, using the language of the pharmaceutical industry in text, logo, colors, and signage. "I'm turning the Sesnon Gallery into a trade show of psychological prosthetics," said Hibbert-Jones. "I'll have an infomercial about the products on display, banners advertising the products, and photos on the walls of people wearing and using the products."
</p>
<p>
  Like political theater, Hibbert-Jones's work is both serious and satirical, with the intent of stimulating discussion of important issues related to mental illness, diagnosis, prescription, and treatment. The Sesnon installation will also include an interactive performance art aspect--outside the gallery, performers in lab coats will interview people about depression and anxiety to kick-start conversations about mental health.
</p>
<p>
  Hibbert-Jones said that she will take the project on tour later this year to museums and galleries throughout the United States. She also noted that a portable "Psychological Prosthetics Trauma Unit" will tour Europe in 2006.
</p>
<p>
  Assistant Professor <b>Jennifer Parker</b>'s sculptures and installations combine found and manipulated sounds, organic material, video, and performances. Her contribution to the <i>Faculty Works: 2005</i> exhibit will include <i>Wigsuit,</i> a performance sculpture consisting of a suit she constructed from over 100 wigs manufactured in Japan; and <i>Self-Portrait,</i> a piece created in response to the 2004 presidential elections made up of oil clay and digital images.
</p>
<p>
  Parker will also exhibit a life-sized latex figure and skin with five crocheted speaker pods titled <i>Skinned (Sound Residue).</i> She said the work was created "as a result of thinking about sound as vibration...waves bounding off the body or being absorbed by the body. I imagined silence--a figure with no ears, having recently hatched or shed her skin...and of sounds embedded in the skin...left behind as residue of her life."
</p>
<p>
  <b>Ed Osborn,</b> assistant professor of electronic and digital media, was born in Helsinki, Finland, and is now based in Oakland and Berlin. His sound art pieces come in a variety of forms, including installations, sculpture, radio, video, and public performance projects. Osborn's works range from rumbling fans and sounding train sets to squirming music boxes and delicate feedback networks.
</p>
<p>
  For the Sesnon exhibit, Osborn will create a remix of <i>Attempting Ziggurats,</i> based on the story of the Tower of Babel and its ongoing reverberations in American culture. "The forms of social, political, and economic organizations needed to build the Tower of Babel--those of a massive system of coercion in service of an enormous and delusional task--are ones that recur frequently in American history," Osborn noted.
</p>
<p>
  <i>An opening reception will be held on Wednesday, April 6, from 5 to 7 p.m. Sesnon Gallery hours are Tuesday through Saturday from noon to 5 p.m. A lecture series with a talk by each of the artists will take place at Porter College Faculty Gallery: Dee Hibbert-Jones, April 12; Ed Osborn, April 13; and Jennifer Parker, April 20.

<p>
  UCSC faculty have had great success with a new approach to teaching computer programming in which students work together in pairs.
</p>
<p>
  Studies at UCSC and elsewhere indicate that the technique has benefits for all students and can help increase the participation of female students in computer science programs.
</p>
<p>
  In traditional introductory courses, students work individually on programming assignments, and teaming up with another student would be considered cheating. Pair programming, in contrast, brings students together in pairs, both working at the same computer to tackle problems as a team.
</p>
<p>
  "We found that pair programming was great for everyone, men and women, and the improvements in terms of the retention of women in computer science were dramatic," said Linda Werner, a lecturer in computer science who led a study of pair programming involving more than 500 students at UCSC.
</p>
<p>
  The study, funded by the National Science Foundation, brought together UCSC researchers with expertise in computer science, psychology, and statistics. Werner's collaborators include Charles McDowell, professor of computer science; Brian Hanks, one of McDowell's former graduate students who is now at Fort Lewis College in Colorado; Heather Bullock, associate professor of psychology; and Julian Fernald, assistant director of institutional research at UCSC.
</p>
<p>
  According to McDowell, the results show that pair programming is an effective teaching tool, and there is no evidence of any disadvantages from this approach. "There is nothing to indicate any reason not to do pair programming," he said.
</p>
<p>
  Werner first heard about pair programming from a researcher at North Carolina State University in 2000, around the same time that the American Association of University Women released a report on factors that limit the participation of women in computer science. Among the factors identified in the report was the perception that computer science involves working alone in a highly competitive environment.
</p>
<p>
  "Pair programming just seemed like a good way to address those issues, but I wanted to do a careful study that would give us quantitative results on its effectiveness," Werner said.
</p>
<p>
  The UCSC study found that students who programmed in pairs produced better programs, completed the course at higher rates, and performed about as well on the final exam as students who programmed independently.
</p>
<p>
  Among female students, those who did pair programming were much more likely to declare a computer science-related major than those who worked individually. The retention rate (percentage who stayed with computer science) increased for both men and women, but the improvement was especially striking for women, Werner said.
</p>
<p>
  The researchers have also seen good results from pair programming with students at San Jose State University and Cabrillo College. Werner said she is now eager to spread the news about pair programming's benefits more broadly to computer science programs throughout the country. The researchers published an article about pair programming and the retention of female students in the March issue of <a href="http://www.cra.org/CRN/articles/march05/werner.html"><i>Computing Research News</i></a>.
</p>
<p>
  "This is a publication that goes to all of the department chairs in computer science and related programs, so it will get to the people who are in a position to affect teaching policies," Werner said.
</p>
<p>
  McDowell said some faculty still feel uncomfortable with pair programming because of the possibility that one partner in the pair will dominate and the other person will not learn as much as they might on their own.
</p>
<p>
  "My response is to consider what happens to the weaker students in traditional programs. Either they struggle on their own or they find someone who can help them, which is what pair programming gives them. So I don't think we've introduced any new problems," McDowell said.
</p>
<p>
  "Some weak students will learn more, some will continue to flail, but I don't think a weak student is harmed by pair programming. They have someone they can talk to, they get to see a working solution, and they can learn from that," McDowell said.<br>

<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  In celebration of the Koret Jewish Book Awards, the UCSC Jewish Studies Program Research Colloquia will present a lecture by Elisheva Baumgarten, winner of this year's prestigious Koret Jewish History Book Prize, at noon on April 12 at the Cowell College Provost House.
</p>
<p>
  The event is cosponsored by the Women's Studies Department and admission is free.
</p>
<p>
  The Koret Jewish Book Award is considered to be one of the highest honors for authors writing prose on Jewish themes. Baumgarten joins five other authors, including renowned Israeli novelist Amos Oz, as a 2005 recipient of the award. Each award carries a $10,000 prize, and the Koret Jewish Book Awards Ceremony this year will be the centerpiece of a Jewish Literary Arts Series in San Francisco.
</p>
<p>
  Baumgarten was honored for her book, <i>Mothers and Children: Jewish Family Life in Medieval Europe,</i> published by Princeton University Press and described as "a richly detailed and deeply researched contribution to our understanding of the relationship between Jews and their non-Jewish neighbors." She will speak at UCSC on the topic: "Women's Rites: Birth Ceremonies in Medieval Jewish Culture."
</p>
<p>
  Baumgarten completed her doctorate in 2000 at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. She is a social historian and lecturer in the Department of Jewish History and the Gender Studies Program at Bar-Ilan University, specializing in the history of Jewish women, Jewish family life, and Jewish-Christian relations in medieval Ashkenaz. Baumgarten lives in Jerusalem with her husband and three children.

        <title>Jane Wilhelms, professor of computer science</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_5600" align="alignright" width="150"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/04/wilhelms_jane.150.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-5600" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/04/wilhelms_jane.150.jpg" alt="Jane Wilhelms Photo: Monica Lee" width="150" height="216" /></a>Jane Wilhelms Photo: Monica Lee[/caption]

<p>
  Jane Wilhelms, professor of computer science and an expert in computer graphics and animation, died of cancer on March 26 in Santa Cruz. She was 56.
</p>
<p>
  Wilhelms began her career as a biologist, teaching anatomy and physiology for many years at junior colleges before returning to school in computer science. Much of her work in computer graphics, including techniques for animal modeling and animation, drew on her background in biology.
</p>
<p>
  Wilhelms joined the UCSC faculty in 1985, immediately after completing her M.S. and Ph.D. in computer science at UC Berkeley. She earned her B.A. in zoology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and an M.A. in biology at Stanford University. Her experience in computer graphics and animation included working as a consultant programmer at Lucasfilm, where the <i>Star Wars</i> movies were produced, while she was a graduate student at UC Berkeley.
</p>
<p>
  The use of computer graphics to help other scientists visualize their data was an area in which Wilhelms made significant contributions at UCSC, serving as project director of the UCSC Scientific Visualization Laboratory. The laboratory, used by faculty in the Baskin School of Engineering and the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences, was established with a grant from the National Science Foundation in 1997 and received additional funding from the NASA Ames Research Center.
</p>
<p>
  A memorial service will be held April 14 in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, where Wilhelms was born. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made in Wilhelms's memory to the <a href="http://www.unitedpegasus.com">United Pegasus Foundation</a>, a California horse rescue organization. Checks made payable to "United Pegasus Foundation" may be sent to Wilhelms's sister, Janet Cutler, P.O. Box 5261, De Pere, WI 54115.

<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  Adventure-naturalists Kennan and Karen Ward will show slides and share stories from their recent four-month trip to the Antarctic on April 22 at 7 p.m. at the Rio Theater. The slide show, titled "Antarctica: 100 days in the Wildest Place on Earth," focuses on the extraordinary wildlife and beauty of the Weddell Sea. The massive expanses of tabular ice in this region serve as a barometer to the world for the effects of global warming.
</p>
<p>
  Proceeds will benefit local members of the California Wild Heritage Campaign as well as the UCSC Recreation Department. CWHC is a broad coalition of conservation groups, businesses, and individuals committed to protecting California's remaining wild public lands and rivers. The current priority of the campaign is to build support for legislation that would protect 300,000 acres of public land on California's north Coast.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Tickets are $11 for students, $14 general admission in advance, and $16 general admission at the door. Tickets may be purchased online at <a href="http://www.kennanward.com">www.kennanward.com</a>. For more information, contact Cori Houston , UCSC Recreation Department, (831) 459-2800, <a href="mailto:chouston@ucsc.edu">chouston@ucsc.edu</a>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  The UCSC community is invited to help the city of Santa Cruz launch its General Plan update by participating in one of two "visioning festivals" planned this month (see <a href="http://currents.ucsc.edu/04-05/04-04/poster.asp">flier</a>). The first Cruz to the Future festival will take place this Saturday, April 9, at Branciforte Middle School; the second, on Saturday, April 23, at Bay View Elementary School. Both events will take place between noon and 4 p.m. and will cover the same information. City residents can come at anytime during the event and stay as long as their schedules permit.<br>
  <br>
  The festivals will help to set the guiding principles and vision for the city during the 15-year planning period (through 2020) that will be covered by its next General Plan. Graphic facilitators will be on hand to capture the community's ideas. Entertainment and demonstrations are also planned, as well as other fun activities for children and families.

        <title>Economics institute hosts daylong workshop</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 04 Apr 2005 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  Monetary policy was the focus of a daylong workshop hosted April 1 by the Santa Cruz Center for International Economics (SCCIE).
</p>
<p>
  Academic and central bank economists attended the gathering, entitled "The Implications of Uncertainty and Learning for Monetary Policy."
</p>
<p>
  Several papers were presented during the event, which was held in the Alumni Room at the University Center. A dinner followed the workshop, which was organized by Carl Walsh, professor of economics, and Federico Ravenna, assistant professor of economics.
</p>
<p>
  The research discussed at the workshop focused either on new approaches to incorporating learning behavior into the types of models central banks use to formulate their policy decisions, or on ways of developing monetary policies that perform well when the central bank has only an imperfect knowledge of how the economy behaves.
</p>
<p>
  Ravenna chaired the morning session, which included the presentation of three research papers: Robert J. Tetlow of the Federal Reserve Board with discussant George Evans of the University of Oregon; William A. Branch of UC Irvine with discussant Bruce Preston of Columbia University; and John C. Williams of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco with discussant Steven Durlauf of the University of Wisconsin.
</p>
<p>
  Walsh chaired the afternoon session, which began with a paper written by three economists from the European Central Bank: Vitor Gaspar, Frank Smets, and David Vestin. Vestin presented the paper, which was discussed by Richard Dennis of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. The second session featured Nicoletta Batini of the International Monetary Fund, with discussant Luis-Felipe Zanna of the Federal Reserve Board. The final paper of the day was by Kai Leitemo of the Norwegian School of Management and Ulf Soderstrom of the Universita Bocconi, with Ravenna serving as discussant.<br>

<p>
  A forum on the Business Transformation process, which will consolidate 26 service centers into one, will be held from 10:30 a.m. to noon on Wednesday, April 13, at the Music Center Recital Hall.
</p>
<p>
  Campus controller Kirk Lew will provide an overview of the process, and the five project managers will give updates. The event will include time for questions and answers.
</p>
<p>
  Sponsored by the Staff Advisory Board and the Business Transformation Program, the forum is designed to let the campus community know how the consolidation will affect everything from travel reimbursements to purchasing and staff hiring.
</p>
<p>

<p>
  For the volunteers who join work crews each quarter to help preserve UCSC's natural areas, the effort is a labor of love.
</p>
<p>
  "It really is a wonderful way to get out, with a great group of people, and work to help the environment," said paleoceanography researcher and volunteer Linda Anderson.
</p>
<p>
  "There's a problem here, and we're out to address it," she said.
</p>
<p>
  The problems are invasive, non-native species and erosion. Work crews pull out the troublesome plants, replant areas with native species, and also monitor the campus to detect invasive species problems.
</p>
<p>
  Scott Loosley, who heads the Site Stewardship Program of Grounds Services, estimates volunteers have added at least 2,000 plants to the UCSC landscape, mostly in the Long Marine Lab area.
</p>
<p>
  The work can be demanding--Anderson said she could recommend it as aerobic exercise--but it also comes with a sense of satisfaction. "In the few years I've volunteered at Younger Lagoon I've been able to see once-tiny plants that we've planted thrive and form a thick cover that helps to keep out the weeds," said volunteer Laura Goodhue. A 1991 UCSC graduate, Goodhue is a field assistant for the Fort Ord Natural Reserve rare plant survey.
</p>
<p>
  Students--whether as volunteers or interns--are the backbone of the volunteer preservationists, though staff and faculty members also take part. Loosley made a presentation at the March 10 Staff Forum to encourage more staff participation.
</p>
<p>
  Volunteers sign up to work for four hours on weekends through either the <a href="http://ucscplant.ucsc.edu/ucscplant/Grounds/index.jsp?page=Stewardship_Program">Site Stewardship Program</a> or the <a href="http://ucreserve.ucsc.edu/">UCSC Natural Reserves.</a>
</p>
<p>
  Maggie Fusari is director of the UCSC Natural Reserves and Sean McStay, is the reserve steward of the Campus, Younger Lagoon, and Fort Ord Reserves. The Natural Reserves are administered by the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences.
</p>
<p>
  "The campus stewardship program is vital to the UCSC Campus Natural Reserve, the Younger Lagoon Natural Reserve, and the UCSC campus in general," said Fusari. "Those of us who are charged to take care of these lands depend on students and staff to help us with basic land maintenance projects such as weed control, restoration of native plant communities, and monitoring of the conditions of our natural systems."
</p>
<p>
  "I am very proud to be working with Scott Loosley and Sean McStay (who did his own senior thesis on restoration of one of our interpretive trails) because they have made this program work," said Fusari. "The volunteers love them and love working with them. And the entire campus benefits from the improved care of its precious natural lands."
</p>
<p>
  The largest numbers of volunteers usually turn out in the fall, when students in environmental studies associate professor Karen Holl's <i>Restoration Ecology</i> class are required to participate in a restoration project of some kind. Several student interns also participate each quarter.
</p>
<p>
  Many student volunteers have gone off to do credited work in ecology, restoration, plant science, and environmental management in classes, internships, and even senior thesis projects, Fusari noted.
</p>
<p>
  Each workday includes an educational component. If the volunteers are rebuilding a forest path, for instance, Loosley will explain how taking a shortcut through the forest leads to root compaction, which can kill the trees.
</p>
<p>
  "I've learned something each time; native plants are my avocation and my passion," said Anderson.
</p>
<p>
  Laura Goodhue has found her work at the Younger Lagoon Reserve especially rewarding. "There's lots to love about volunteering at Younger Lagoon Reserve," she said. "It is good to be in the company of people who want to make a difference."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Working in these areas also provides a chance to enjoy nature, Goodhue said. "There are gorgeous-smelling plants to smell, all kinds of birds to watch, and occasionally I've even seen a beautiful bobcat."
</p>
<p>
  This spring, there will be several opportunities for volunteers to do their part.
</p>
<p>
  On April 9 and April 23, the Grounds Site Stewardship Program will be doing native planting and maintenance at Long Marine Lab. On May 14, the project will be in the Great Meadow Invasive Plant Removal. To RSVP and for additional details, e-mail <a href="mailto:grounds_interns@ucsc.edu">grounds_interns@ucsc.edu</a> or call (831) 459-2643.
</p>
<p>
  UCSC Natural Reserves stewardship days will be held May 1 at Younger Lagoon Reserve. On May 7, and May 22, workers will concentrate on Campus Natural Reserve work. To sign up, e-mail <a href="mailto:mcstay@ucsc.edu">mcstay@ucsc.edu</a>.

<p>
  Ever wondered what it's really like to work in the entertainment industry? For the past eight years, UCSC students have flocked to a popular class taught by television consultant and UCSC alumnus Loren Steck for an inside look at the realities of an actual career in Hollywood.
</p>
<p>
  Titled <i>Working in TV and Film,</i> the course brings in highly successful producers, directors, writers, and agents to give a candid, behind-the-scenes look at what their jobs are really like, how they got them, and the types of pressures and constraints they face on a day-to-day-basis. All of the guest lecturers are UCSC alumni.<br>
</p>
<p>
  At a recent class session, Dan Wolf, vice president of corporate communications at the Walt Disney Company, took 50 students through a whirlwind tour of his last 16 years at the company where he writes speeches, crafts press releases, and strategizes for top executives such as celebrated CEO Michael Eisner.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Mixing autobiographical information with backstage details of the quirks and power struggles of the major players at Disney, Wolf shared insights about working at the company from an insider's point of view. At one point, he explained to the students how, while working as press secretary for Los Angeles Supervisor Kenneth Hahn in the early 1980s, he was offered a freelance job to write a speech for the president of Walt Disney Studios--despite the fact that he had never written a speech before in his entire life.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "My advice is never to say no if there's a possibility offered to you in the industry," Wolf told the class. "Don't be intimidated. Because to a certain degree, everybody's faking it at every level. There's a lot of people at high levels of the film industry who are paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to pick successful movies and they fail miserably most of the time. So don't be fooled and think that people with titles, money, and cars are any smarter than you--they may be just as anxious and insecure."<br>
</p>
<p>
  "Things tend to be a little more exaggerated in the entertainment business," Wolf added. "There are less defined skill requirements in this world than for say an engineer. I'm actually one of the few people I know with a liberal arts education who actually uses the job skills I learned in college in my work. When I write a speech, what is it? It's a research paper that involves writing and critical-thinking skills."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Wolf was just one of the eight prominent visitors that Steck brought into the class this year. Other guests included David Tenzer, an agent at Creative Artists Agency; Karina Buck, president of Genuine Buck Film; and Jim Fredrick, senior vice president of creative advertising for Warner Brothers. Recent UCSC graduate Graham Rich also made an appearance, describing how some of the contacts he made in the class helped him to complete his first commercial feature film as producer and director.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Steck himself works in the industry as a consultant, "fixing television pilots and improving programs." He also works directly for the major television networks, advising them on what shows to buy and how to market them. A trustee of the UCSC Foundation for the past eight years, Steck said the idea for the class arose out of a conversation he had with former Porter College Provost Kathy Foley during his term as president of the UCSC Alumni Association in 1996.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "I knew so many alumni in the entertainment industry who so dearly love this campus," Steck recalled. "So I thought, how can I get them involved? It's really a way for them to give back, as well as an attempt to help young students and ease their transition into the real world."<br>
</p>
<p>
  The students seem to appreciate the effort. After the last class session in March, dozens of students gathered around Steck to thank him for offering the course.
</p>
<p>
  "This class gives you the real deal," observed Alex Laleh, a senior film and digital media student. "Most students who come are hoping to get a job related to Hollywood, so they're thrilled to hear personal and realistic appraisals of how hard it is to get in the door. The class was as blunt and frank as possible. It showed the deeper layers of how the industry really works."<br>
</p>

<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  Award-winning journalist Richard Harris, science correspondent for National Public Radio, will speak at UCSC on Wednesday, April 6, as part of a distinguished lecturer series. Harris, a UCSC alumnus, will give a talk entitled "Telling Tales Out of School: How One Reporter Cracks the World of Science."
</p>
<p>
  The event, which is free and open to the public, will begin at 7:30 p.m. in the Stevenson Event Center on the UCSC campus.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Harris, who joined NPR in 1986, reports on science issues for the NPR programs <i>Morning Edition, All Things Considered, and Weekend Edition.</i> He has traveled throughout the world to report on stories, including trips to Antarctica, the Galapagos Islands, Beijing during the SARS epidemic, the center of Greenland, and the Amazon rain forest.
</p>
<p>
  He has earned numerous awards for his reporting and was elected an honorary member of the scientific research society Sigma Xi in 2002.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Harris will spend three days at UCSC as part of the Cowell College Distinguished Visiting Professor program, funded by a UCSC Alumni Association endowment that supports visiting professors at each of the campus's colleges on a rotating basis. The Cowell College program, focusing on public communication about issues relating to science and technology, includes four public lectures in 2005 and 2006.
</p>
<p>
  Harris will meet with a broad range of faculty and students during his visit, including the current class of students in UCSC's Science Communication Program. He will also visit the studios of local public radio station KUSP.<br>
</p>
<p>
  A California native, Harris was valedictorian of his Crown College graduating class at UCSC in 1980. He earned a B.A. in biology, with highest honors, and went straight into journalism, working as a newspaper reporter before joining NPR.
</p>
<p>
  Harris had the instincts of a good reporter even as a student, said John Wilkes, who taught a science writing course Harris took. Wilkes, now director of the Science Communication Program, recalled that when a major wildfire erupted on the Big Sur coast, Harris jumped in his car and drove down to get interviews.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "He talked to everyone--firefighters, forestry officials, residents--and he got all sides of the story, from the people who said it was a natural event that wouldn't hurt anything to those who said it was devastating," Wilkes said. "When we published his story in our <i>Science Notes</i> magazine, we got more letters on that story than we'd ever gotten. There were complaints from both sides about the story's balance, but the letters came in from both sides in equal numbers."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Among the many awards Harris has received during his career as a journalist are the Sagan Award for improving the public understanding of science from the Council of Scientific Society Presidents and the Walter C. Alvarez Memorial Award from the American Medical Writers Association, both awarded in 1999. In 1995, he earned the Science Journalism Award from the American Association for the Advancement of Science for his coverage of endocrine disrupters.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Also in 1995, Harris shared a Peabody Award for investigative reporting about the tobacco industry. He also won the 1994 Aviation/Space Writers Association Gold Award for his coverage of the first Hubble Space Telescope repair mission. He received the 1994 Cindy Award from the Association of Visual Communicators for a story on the ecological impact of non-native species coming to North America.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Harris is cofounder of the Washington, D.C., Area Science Writers Association and past president of the National Association of Science Writers.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Harris's public lecture is sponsored by Cowell College and the Alumni Association, with additional support from KUSP. For more information, contact Cathy Shender at (831) 459-2251.<br>

<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  Huge colonies of seabirds accustomed to nesting on islands free of predators began disappearing when fur traders started introducing foxes onto islands in the Aleutian archipelago in the 18th century.
</p>
<p>
  The ground-nesting birds made easy meals for the foxes. A study published this week in the journal <i>Science</i> now shows that the effects of the introduced foxes rippled through entire island ecosystems, transforming the vegetation from lush grasslands to scrubby, low-growing tundra.<br>
</p>
<p>
  It turns out that the nutrient-poor volcanic soils of the Aleutian archipelago can only support dense grasslands if they receive regular doses of fertilizer in the form of bird droppings.
</p>
<p>
  On islands without foxes, seabirds transfer nutrients from the ocean to the land by feeding on marine fish and invertebrates and spreading nutrient-rich guano around the islands. Add foxes, and the indirect effects on the whole ecosystem are as dramatic as the direct effects on the seabirds.
</p>
<p>
  "Introduced species are a global phenomenon, and we tend to focus on the direct effects, such as the reduction or extinction of species that are consumed by an introduced predator. This study shows how the effects of introduced species can spread throughout an ecosystem in unpredictable ways," said Donald Croll, an assistant professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UCSC and first author of the <i>Science</i> paper.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Efforts by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to remove introduced foxes from the Aleutian islands have been largely successful. Seabirds are beginning to make a comeback on islands previously colonized by foxes, and in some places the vegetation has begun to look lusher.
</p>
<p>
  But it is likely to take decades for the ecosystems to fully recover from the effects of the foxes, said James Estes, adjunct professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UCSC and a coauthor of the paper.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "Most seabirds only have a single offspring each year, so their capacity for population increase is quite low. The foxes are mostly off the islands now, but we will probably continue to see the effects for a long time," Estes said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  In addition to Croll and Estes, the authors of the <i>Science</i> paper include UCSC graduate student Eric Danner, University of Montana plant ecologist John Maron, and USFWS biologist Vernon Byrd. The study grew out of conversations between Estes, who has been doing research in Alaskan coastal waters for decades, and Byrd, the supervisory biologist for the Alaska Maritime National Wildlife Refuge. While working to save the endangered Aleutian Canada goose, which the foxes were driving toward extinction, Byrd had noticed the differences between islands with and without foxes and speculated that nutrients might play a role.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "He had these interesting ideas about foxes and birds and nutrient chains, and I thought we should do some studies to see how robust the idea is," Estes said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The team of researchers, accompanied by a small army of student assistants, conducted extensive surveys on the islands for several weeks each summer over three years. They surveyed dozens of islands from one end of the archipelago to the other. Estes said the differences were striking between fox-free islands and fox-infested islands (defined as those where self-sustaining populations of foxes persisted into the late 1990s).<br>
</p>
<p>
  "When you go to an island that had foxes, it's very easy to walk around because the plants don't grow much higher than your ankles. But on the other islands, it's hard work just to get through the vegetation. It was exhausting just trying to get around on those islands," he said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The researchers found that the density of breeding seabirds on fox-free islands was two orders of magnitude higher than on fox-infested islands. The resulting difference in nutrient inputs was reflected in soil phosphorus levels that were more than three times higher on fox-free islands. The vegetation on the islands also showed significant differences in nutrient content.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Evidence that more ocean-derived nutrients were cycling through the ecosystems of fox-free islands than on fox-infested islands came from analyses of nitrogen isotopes in soil, plant, and animal samples.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "The terrestrial ecosystem was being subsidized by marine-derived nutrients, and the foxes basically cut off the subsidies by interrupting the flow of nutrients coming from offshore," Croll said. "It transformed the plant community from one that does well in nutrient-rich conditions to one that does well in nutrient-depleted conditions."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Foxes were first introduced to some of the islands by Russian fur traders in the mid- to late-18th century as a way to supplement the declining harvest of sea otter pelts. But the practice escalated between the 1890s and the 1930s, when the U.S. government worked to establish fox farming businesses on the islands. Mostly arctic foxes and smaller numbers of red foxes were introduced to more than 400 islands.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Byrd, who has been involved in restoration efforts in the Aleutian islands since 1971, said most of the islands had major breeding colonies of seabirds before the arrival of foxes. There are about 26 species of seabirds that regularly nest on the islands, he said. They include surface nesters, such as gulls and terns, that lay their eggs on the ground; burrow nesters, such as puffins, that dig burrows in the soil for their nests; and crevice nesters, such as auklets, that nest in boulder piles and rock crevices.<br>
</p>
<p>
  According to Byrd, surface nesters and burrow nesters tended to disappear completely from islands with foxes, while populations of crevice nesters were reduced but not eliminated. Ledge nesters such as murres and kittiwakes, which nest on steep cliff faces, were less affected by the foxes, he said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "Wherever the puffins and gulls have come back after the removal of the foxes, the vegetation has started to become lusher again," Byrd said. "The terrestrial ecosystem was probably modified in more ways than we know, and maybe it won't be exactly like it was, but the conditions are there for a successful restoration of the native biodiversity."<br>

<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  A tireless community activist, Geoffrey Canada has been described as "the brother who never left the 'hood because he keeps looking into the faces of the children and seeing himself there."
</p>
<p>
  Canada will discuss his work on behalf of at-risk children and families during a free public lecture entitled "It Takes a 'Hood: Community Revitalization, Educational Reform, and the Harlem Children's Zone," on Tuesday, April 12, at 6:30 p.m. in the Colleges Nine and Ten Multipurpose Room at UCSC.
</p>
<p>
  Free parking will be available at Colleges Nine and Ten and in the Core West Parking Structure, and free shuttles will run between the parking garage and the event.
</p>
<p>
  Canada is the president of the Harlem Children's Zone, which works with children and families in 23 blocks of central Harlem.
</p>
<p>
  The recipient of numerous awards and honorary degrees, Canada in 1994 received the first annual Heinz Award for his work with urban youth.
</p>
<p>
  Canada grew up in poverty in the South Bronx, and his acclaimed memoir, <i>Fist Stick Knife Gun: A Personal History of Violence in America,</i> reveals how the gun lobby fuels gun violence in inner cities. His latest book is <i>Reaching Up for Manhood.</i>
</p>
<p>
  In Harlem, Canada has worked with Rheedlen's Beacon School, which provides support to children and families, the Community Pride Initiative that works with tenants to help them reclaim their neighborhoods, and the Harlem Peacemakers Program, a communitywide effort to reduce violence. Canada has a bachelor's degree from Bowdoin College and a master's from the Harvard Graduate School of Education.
</p>
<p>
  Canada's visit is sponsored by the UCSC <a href="http://cjtc.ucsc.edu">Center for Justice, Tolerance, and Community</a> with support from the Academic Resources Collaborative; African American Resource/Cultural Center; American Studies; Anthropology; Center for Cultural Studies; Chicano/Latino Research Center; Chicano/Latino Resource Center; Colleges Nine and Ten; Community Studies; Education; Educational Opportunity Programs; Institute for Humanities Research; Merrill College; New Teacher Center; Oakes College; Politics; Psychology, and Sociology. The Ford Foundation provided major funding for the event.<br>

        <title>Campus planner discusses LRDP project</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 28 Mar 2005 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>

        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_5569" align="alignright" width="120"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/03/barnes_john.120.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-5569" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/03/barnes_john.120.jpg" alt="John Barnes Photo: Louise Donahue" width="120" height="152" /></a>John Barnes Photo: Louise Donahue[/caption]
<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  In an effort to provide additional information to the campus community about the process of updating the campus's Long Range Development Plan, Currents will periodically discuss various aspects of the LRDP with campus personnel. This month's Q&A is with John Barnes, lead staff planner for the project.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Why does the campus need to grow, and how was the growth projected in the Draft 2005 LRDP determined?</b>
</p>
<p>
  Part of the impetus to grow is due to demographic trends over the next 15 years and our responsibility to maintain the same degree of access to higher education. In other words, we want tomorrow's students to have the same access to higher ed that prior generations had. It's also true that additional graduate and undergraduate students create opportunities for the campus to respond to emerging new academic disciplines. Doing these things enables UCSC to honor its responsibility to serve the people of the region and the state.
</p>
<p>
  During the early part of the LRDP process, a faculty committee called the Strategic Futures Committee and the LRDP Committee studied four enrollment levels: no growth; 17,000; 21,000; and 25,000. After careful consideration of the programmatic and physical implications, the Strategic Futures Committee recommended the 21,000 enrollment. It is important to remember, though, that the LRDP, should it be approved, would not mandate growth, but would provide a physical framework for growth should it come.
</p>
<p>
  <b>What opportunities have there been for public input into the LRDP process, and what opportunities remain?</b>
</p>
<p>
  Revising the LRDP is a two-phase effort. We started the planning phase in fall 2003 and published the Draft 2005 LRDP in January. It was the subject of five public meetings, we received countless written comments, and we included local public officials in our planning process. In January 2005, we began the environmental review phase, which will assess the impacts of the proposed 2005 LRDP in an Environmental Impact Report. We held three public meetings in February to get input on the scope of the analysis. We expect to circulate the Draft EIR in September of this year. There will be a 60-day public review period--15 more than required--with two public meetings and opportunities to comment on its adequacy.
</p>
<p>
  <b>The 1988 LRDP called for specific actions to mitigate the impact of campus growth projected in that plan. What is the status of those mitigation measures?</b>
</p>
<p>
  When the last LRDP revision was done, its EIR identified impacts that needed mitigation to reduce their effect on the physical environment, on and off campus. On campus, these addressed impacts such as water runoff, biotic resources, housing; off-campus issues included traffic and water use. The 1988 LRDP EIR identified 30 mitigations. Over the years, we have added 8 LRDP mitigations due to specific projects. Of the 38 on-campus mitigations, 33 are fully implemented. The remaining mitigation measures are partially implemented, with an infrastructure project under way to fully implement two of these.
</p>
<p>
  Even off campus, where we do not control the timing or funding of the mitigations, we have a very good record in collaborating with the city. Of the 19 "university assistance measures" intended to address off-campus impacts related to UCSC activities, 8 are complete, 3 are either in process or in negotiation, and 8 await initiation by the city. Through the university assistance measures, we have contributed $1.4 million toward off-campus infrastructure upgrades.

        <title>Computer scientist Cormac Flanagan wins Sloan Research Fellowship</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_5567" align="alignright" width="160"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/03/flanagan_cormac.160.gif"><img class="size-full wp-image-5567" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/03/flanagan_cormac.160.gif" alt="Cormac Flanagan" width="160" height="210" /></a>Cormac Flanagan[/caption]
<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  The Alfred P. Sloan Foundation has awarded a Sloan Research Fellowship in computer science to Cormac Flanagan, assistant professor of computer science at UCSC.
</p>
<p>
  Flanagan, whose research focuses on new techniques for ferreting out the bugs in computer software, is among 116 young scientists, mathematicians, and economists selected this year to receive the prestigious fellowships. The Sloan Research Fellowships are intended to provide crucial and flexible funds to outstanding young researchers early in their academic careers. They include a grant of $45,000 that provides largely unrestricted support for research.
</p>
<p>
  The primary goal of Flanagan's research is to develop tools for finding software defects and ensuring software reliability. According to a recent estimate from the National Institute of Standards and Technology, software defects cost the U.S. economy about $60 billion annually.
</p>
<p>
  "This is an issue that is just crying out for more research," Flanagan said.
</p>
<p>
  One area of software validation where Flanagan has made significant contributions is in addressing the challenges posed by computer systems that run multiple operations simultaneously. "Multithreaded" software in which different parts of a program are executed concurrently is increasingly common, but programmers must be careful to ensure that all the threads can run at the same time without interfering with each other.
</p>
<p>
  "I sometimes tell people there are leprechauns running around inside the computer, and I make sure the leprechauns don't trip over one another," Flanagan said.
</p>
<p>
  Flanagan earned a B.S. in computer science and mathematics at University College Dublin and worked as a software engineer in Ireland for a year before coming to the United States for graduate school. He earned his M.S. and Ph.D. in computer science from Rice University and worked in Silicon Valley for six years as a principal research scientist at the Systems Research Center (now run by Hewlett-Packard).
</p>
<p>
  In 2003, Flanagan joined the Computer Science Department at UCSC, where he is part of a growing group of faculty conducting research in software engineering.
</p>
<p>
  "UCSC is increasingly prominent in the area of software engineering, and the growth of the engineering school as a whole has been remarkable. I think this award is illustrative of the growing recognition of this campus as a research powerhouse," Flanagan said.
</p>
<p>
  The Sloan Research Fellowship Program is one of the oldest fellowship programs in the country. It began in 1955 as a means of encouraging research by young scholars at a critical time in their careers when other support is difficult to obtain. The Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, a philanthropic nonprofit institution, was established in 1934 by Alfred P. Sloan Jr., then-president and chief executive officer of the General Motors Corporation.

        <title>UCSC to offer computer game design as a new track for computer science students</title>

<p>
  The development of interactive computer video games has become a multi-billion-dollar industry that caters to the legions of gaming enthusiasts with a steady output of new games featuring ever greater levels of technical sophistication.
</p>
<p>
  For students whose interest in games goes beyond merely playing them, UCSC's Jack Baskin School of Engineering now offers the opportunity to specialize in computer game design through a new track in the computer science major.
</p>
<p>
  The Computer Science Department has put together a series of courses that will give students an in-depth introduction to the design and technology of interactive computer video games.
</p>
<p>
  "The students we've talked to are very excited about it. To my knowledge, this is the first undergraduate initiative in computer gaming in the UC system," said Ira Pohl, professor and chair of computer science. "There are a few places nationally that have similar programs, but it is still a new area." Through a combination of new and existing courses, the computer gaming track will give students a strong grounding in key areas such as computer graphics and animation, artificial intelligence, and software engineering. Students will also be able to undertake a major game design project.
</p>
<p>
  From a technical standpoint, today's video games present extraordinarily difficult design challenges, said Darrell Long, professor of computer science and associate dean for research and graduate studies in the engineering school.
</p>
<p>
  "There is a lot of hard science involved in creating the virtual worlds that people enter when they play these games. You also have to think about things like story lines and the look and flow of the game," Long said. "My hope is that eventually we will have a separate major in computer game design that will include not only computer science courses but also courses from the Arts Division and other parts of campus."
</p>
<p>
  UCSC's Arts Division already has a multidisciplinary graduate program in digital arts and new media that brings together faculty from engineering, arts, and other divisions on campus. A full major in computer game design would probably take a similar multidisciplinary approach to address both the technical and creative aspects of game design, Long said. For now, the gaming track in the computer science major focuses primarily on the technical aspects.
</p>
<p>
  The economic and cultural significance of computer games is undeniable. A recent analysis of the U.S. market for computer and video game software by the NPD Group reported that eight games were sold every second of 2004, for total sales of $7.3 billion. Some estimates have put the global market at greater than $25 billion per year.
</p>
<p>
  "The economic impact is huge. Computer games are bigger than Hollywood movies now, and we want to help ensure that the state of California remains a leader in this field," Long said.

        <title>Exhibit of early years at Cowell College includes photos, memorabilia</title>

<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  Cowell College opened in the fall of 1965 as a "challenging and imaginative experiment" undertaken by 650 students and 40 faculty members.
</p>
<p>
  In celebration of its 40th anniversary, the college will present an exhibition titled <i>Reminiscing: Cowell College, The Early Years,</i> focusing on historical highlights from 1965 to 1975. The exhibit runs from April 16 to May 29 at the Eloise Pickard Smith Gallery.
</p>
<p>
  "I think what most people don't realize is that the history of Cowell and the early years of the university are one and the same," noted Linda Pope, curator of the gallery and the exhibit. "Cowell was the only college in existence when UCSC was founded in 1965."
</p>
<p>
  Pope said the exhibit will feature long-forgotten and little-known memorabilia and artwork--including a large flowered, psychedelic Andy Warhol rug that graced the provost's house until as late as the early 1990s. She added that the walls of the gallery will be covered with black-and-white photographs, letters, documents, and quotations illustrating the history of Cowell.
</p>
<p>
  "I'm trying to come up with something different--things that haven't been seen before," said Pope. "I hope to use some very unusual early shots by Ansel Adams, an early protest poster, and some works by artists from the Cowell Press. The exhibit will show the clothing of the period and the feel of the times."
</p>
<p>
  Adding to the historical atmosphere, a mix tape of music from the era will play in the background. Visitors will also be able to watch Super 8 films made by former students of the actual construction of Cowell College in the 1960s. Additional footage will include an interview with the late art history professor Mary Holmes about the early days of Cowell, and founding provost Page Smith being interviewed on CBS's <i>60 Minutes</i> about the subject of education.
</p>
<p>
  The adjoining Annex Gallery will also feature a display of watercolors by Cowell icon Jasper Rose, the innovative art professor and second provost of the college who now resides in England.
</p>
<p>
  "I think it's going to be a fun exhibition and a great showcase of previously inaccessible items that Linda had to dig up," said Tyrus Miller, newly appointed in January as joint provost of Cowell with his wife, Deanna Shemek. "It's a chance for people to experience the strong sense of community, personality, and tradition at Cowell that goes back many years."
</p>
<p>
  Alumni visiting the campus during the Banana Slug Spring Fair weekend will have an opportunity to meet the new provosts during a special April 16 reception in the gallery between 4 and 6 p.m. The opening reception for the exhibit--featuring live music and refreshments--begins earlier that same day at 2 p.m. For more information, contact the Eloise Pickard Smith Gallery at (831) 459-2953.<br>

        <title>New Teacher Center wins $1.5 million contract to participate in federal study of support programs</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 21 Mar 2005 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>5551</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  The highly regarded New Teacher Center at UCSC has been awarded a $1.5 million contract to participate in the federal government's first major evaluation of programs that school districts offer novice teachers.
</p>
<p>
  The U.S. Department of Education's Institute of Education Sciences (IES) selected Mathematica Policy Research, Inc., to carry out the $10.3 million, five-year evaluation study. The study will examine the effects of two programs, the NTC Induction Model and ETS PATHWISE.
</p>
<p>
  The New Teacher Center (NTC) has supported beginning teachers since 1988, and now works across the country with school districts interested in intensive induction models. In response to the national policy emphasis on teacher quality, most school districts provide support for new teachers.
</p>
<p>
  However, program quality varies, and there is little research to guide districts in improving their efforts. This timely and important IES study will inform districts in making decisions on how best to allocate professional development dollars.
</p>
<p>
  "We know that teacher quality is the single most important variable in student performance, and we also know that the first two years of teaching are the most challenging," says NTC executive director Ellen Moir. "Our NTC induction model has been shown to cut new teacher dropout rates by half, and we are beginning to show significant impact on student learning. Participating in the IES study is an opportunity to validate our results and increase our understanding of induction efforts."
</p>
<p>
  The NTC induction model pairs beginning teachers with carefully selected and highly trained experienced teachers released full-time from their classroom duties. Without the split demands of classroom teaching and after-school mentoring, these veteran teachers become skillful "teachers of teachers" who work weekly with novices in their classrooms. Mentors receive ongoing professional development along with a set of mentoring tools and protocols that focus their work with beginning teachers on student learning and classroom practice. The mentors carefully assess the novices' professional needs and then tailor their work accordingly, using the NTC induction materials.
</p>
<p>
  The IES study will select 20 urban school districts to participate. Ten sites will be assigned to implement the NTC induction model, and 10 sites will implement ETS PATHWISE. Two veteran teachers will be selected in each district to work full-time with first-year teachers at 10 elementary school sites, while a control group of beginning teachers will receive support through the district's preexisting induction program. NTC project director Jan Miles will lead a team of NTC outreach coordinators to provide professional development for the mentors and to work onsite in the 10 districts to guide implementation through June 2006.
</p>
<p>
  Mathematica researchers will track the effectiveness of each program on teacher retention, classroom practice, and student achievement.
</p>
<p>
  "The NTC is committed to ensuring that all new teachers enter schools with the support they need and deserve," noted NTC associate director Janet Gless. "This work is critical, not just to retain new teachers, but to develop outstanding teachers and help our schools become learning communities where students and teachers, alike, are successful."<br>

        <title>Exercise mentorship program draws more than 400 participants</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 21 Mar 2005 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>5549</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  With more than 400 people signing up and plenty of positive feedback, the "Adopt-A-Fellow Slug Exercise Mentorship Program" at the Wellness Center has been declared a success.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "I have had many people tell me in person that this program has given them energy that they haven't felt in years," said Ryan Andrews, Wellness Center director. "I have also heard from quite a few about weight loss."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Under the program, regular exercisers were asked to adopt their nonexercising coworkers or friends on campus and help them establish a regular physical activity routine. (See <a href="http://currents.ucsc.edu/04-05/01-10/fitness.asp">earlier Currents story</a> for details.)<br>
</p>
<p>
  "We had 421 total participants sign up--255 students and 166 staff/faculty--and thus far have had about 280 turn in their logs," Andrews said last week.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "One of the big reasons why we were successful is because it was supported by so many groups," he said. "Each college contributed funds for the student portion of the program, along with Counseling and Psychological Services. Staff and Academic Human Resources funded the majority of the program for faculty and staff."<br>
</p>
<p>
  All participants received Odwalla bars when they reached 10 sessions of physical activity and t-shirts when they reached 20 sessions. Miriam Bellows, a student at Crown College, won the grand prize, a mountain bike, which also was donated by Odwalla.<br>
</p>
<p>
  This e-mail from a staff member was a typical comment on the program, Andrews said: "Thanks for this opportunity to improve my health, reduce my stress, and enhance my concentration at work. I know many others on campus who feel the same way."<br>

<p>
  Steve Kang, dean of UCSC's Jack Baskin School of Engineering, has been appointed to the Blue Ribbon Task Force on Nanotechnology (BRTFN), a joint federal-state venture to benefit Silicon Valley and promote California as the premier center for nanotechnology research, development, and commercialization.
</p>
<p>
  The BRTFN is cochaired by U.S. Representative Mike Honda of San Jose and California State Controller Steve Westly. Members of the task force include nanotechnology experts with backgrounds in industry, academia, government, medical research, and venture capital.
</p>
<p>
  "BRTFN members will have the opportunity to influence the regional development of nanotechnology, helping usher in a revolutionary new era in technology that will attract investment from governments and businesses around the world," Honda said. "Working in conjunction with the NASA Ames Research Center, Controller Westly and I have the highest expectations for the potential of this endeavor."
</p>
<p>
  UC Santa Cruz, with its close ties to NASA Ames through the University Affiliated Research Center (UARC), is in a strong strategic position to help develop the nanotechnology industry, Kang said.
</p>
<p>
  "This appointment provides a great opportunity to contribute to the creation of new industry for Silicon Valley and California," Kang said. "Nanotechnology is a critical enabling technology with a broad spectrum of applications and will surely need a strong home base in California, in particular in the greater Silicon Valley region."
</p>
<p>
  Nanotechnology has the potential to yield revolutionary new materials and processes by enabling scientists and engineers to control how things are made on the atomic and molecular scales. The National Science Foundation predicts the worldwide market for nanotechnology products and services to reach $1 trillion by 2015.
</p>
<p>
  "Nanotechnology sounds like something out of Star Trek, but it's already being used in cars, tennis rackets, and stain-proof pants," Westly said. "To stay at the center of innovation, California needs to be the worldwide headquarters for nanotechnology. We're asking this group to think big about the future of small technology."
</p>
<p>
  The BRTFN will document its work in a series of white papers that analyze the direction and state of nanotechnology, followed by specific recommendations aimed at promoting Silicon Valley and California as the national and worldwide center of nanotechnology research, development, and commercialization. Congressman Honda said he will sponsor federal legislation necessary to advance BRTFN recommendations, while Controller Westly will coordinate state-level efforts.
</p>
<p>
  "The BRTFN has the potential to generate new state revenues from a multitude of job opportunities," Honda noted. "The patents, royalties, and other economic effects of this industry could benefit the state budget for decades to come."

        <title>Accreditation committee report submitted to campus</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 14 Mar 2005 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>5543</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  The report by the visiting team of the Western Association of Schools and Colleges' (WASC) educational effectiveness review has been submitted to the campus and is <a href="http://planning.ucsc.edu/wasc/PDF/WASC_EEReview_2005.pdf">available online</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The report makes a number of thought-provoking suggestions about campus organization, undergraduate, graduate and professional education, and concludes that "the opportunities before the University of California-Santa Cruz far outweigh its challenges and suggest an extremely exciting future for an institution long viewed as an important trailblazer in American higher education."
</p>
<p>
  "The campus appreciates the hard work of the visiting committee and their thoughtful recommendations," said Vice Provost William Ladusaw, the campus's accreditation liaison officer. "We look forward to further campus discussion on how to implement some of them to enhance our educational effectiveness and academic planning as we move forward."
</p>
<p>
  The committee of eight distinguished academic administrators visited UCSC February 2-4 in the closing phase of the review. They consulted with administrators and faculty leadership to assess UCSC's commitment to "educational effectiveness" as defined in the WASC criteria for review and discussed several strategic issues with the campus leadership.
</p>
<p>
  Educational effectiveness within the framework of the review involves two things: whether students are successfully achieving the learning objectives of UCSC's programs and whether the institution has good processes for assessing and improving its effectiveness.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Now that the report has been completed, the next step is a June 2005 meeting of the Western Association of Schools and Colleges' Commission to approve the full review, taking action on UCSC's reaccreditation.<br>
</p>
<p>
  All four-year colleges and universities in the United States must be reaccredited periodically to earn federal support for student scholarships, loans, and grants. One of six regional associations, WASC reviews educational institutions in California, Guam, and Hawaii. Its recommendations for accreditation are reported to the U.S. Department of Education. UCSC was last accredited in 1994.<br>

<p>
  The highest levels of silver contamination ever observed in the open ocean turned up in samples collected during a survey of the North Pacific in 2002. UCSC researchers measured silver concentrations 50 times greater than the natural background level.
</p>
<p>
  Though still well below levels that would be toxic to marine life, this contamination of what had been considered relatively pristine waters highlights the increasingly global impact of industrial emissions from Asia, the researchers said.
</p>
<p>
  "The most likely source of the silver contamination is atmospheric emissions from coal burning in Asia," said Russell Flegal, professor of environmental toxicology. "Silver concentrations in the North Pacific trace the atmospheric depositions of industrial aerosols from Asia, with the highest concentrations in those waters closest to the Asian mainland."
</p>
<p>
  Mara Ranville, a researcher in Flegal's lab who earned her Ph.D. in December, collected the samples on a 35-day cruise in the summer of 2002 as part of the Global Investigation of Pollution in the Marine Environment (GIPME), a program of the UNESCO Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission. Ranville and Flegal reported their findings in the March 9 issue of <i>Geochemistry, Geophysics, Geosystems,</i> an electronic journal published by the American Geophysical Union and the Geochemical Society.
</p>
<p>
  Ranville found silver concentrations as high as 1.2 parts per trillion in samples of North Pacific surface waters taken during the cruise. This is about 50 times higher than baseline levels of silver in uncontaminated waters sampled by UCSC researchers on a previous cruise in the Atlantic Ocean. Because the natural background level is so low, scientists may be able to use silver as a tracer element for tracking the fate of industrial emissions from Asia, Ranville said.
</p>
<p>
  "Atmospheric pollution from Asia is becoming a serious problem for the western United States, and this may be a valuable tool for tracing those emissions, both in the atmosphere and in the water," she said.
</p>
<p>
  Prevailing westerly winds carry atmospheric pollution across the North Pacific ocean from China, where coal is the primary fuel and the use of emissions controls is limited. Major pollutants from the burning of coal are nitrogen and sulfur compounds that contribute to acid rain and smog. Previous studies by Flegal's group have also found high mercury levels in rainfall on the U.S. West Coast, which they linked to contamination from coal burning in Asia.
</p>
<p>
  "Unlike mercury, silver is not a human health concern. But silver is second only to mercury in its toxicity to marine invertebrates," Flegal said.
</p>
<p>
  Sam Luoma, a U.S. Geological Survey scientist who has worked with Flegal to study heavy metal contamination in San Francisco Bay, said the elevated silver concentrations in the open ocean suggest there may be "hotspots" in Asian coastal waters where the concentrations reach toxic levels.
</p>
<p>
  "The open ocean is vastly diluted, so there may be some massive hotspots of silver contamination around the Asian continent. That's where effects on marine organisms would occur," Luoma said.
</p>
<p>
  In San Francisco Bay, silver and copper from industrial discharges reached such high levels in the 1970s and early 1980s that clams stopped reproducing and some species of invertebrates disappeared from mudflats, he said. At that time, silver concentrations in the bay were 100 times higher than the levels Ranville and Flegal found in the open ocean. With stricter pollution controls, however, silver has now declined to around 6 parts per trillion in bay waters, and the affected invertebrates have recovered, Luoma said.
</p>
<p>
  The North Pacific survey completes a preliminary survey of silver throughout the world's oceans. The goal was to establish current levels of contamination as a baseline for future studies, Flegal said.
</p>
<p>
  "We found by far the highest levels of silver in the North Pacific. Even though the Atlantic Ocean is subject to industrial emissions from North America and Europe, the amounts are small compared to what goes into the Pacific from Asia," he said.

        <title>New CASFS manual focuses on the business of small-scale farming</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_5538" align="alignright" width="180"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/03/farm_manual.180.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-5538" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/03/farm_manual.180.jpg" alt="A new publication by CASFS offers marketing ideas and strategies for small-scale farming." width="180" height="231" /></a>A new publication by CASFS offers marketing ideas and strategies for small-scale farming.[/caption]
<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  The economics of corporate-dominated food production today make it tough for small-scale farmers to make ends meet. Despite long hours and backbreaking work, they often have little money in the bank.
</p>
<p>
  A new publication by the Center for Agroecology & Sustainable Food Systems (CASFS) focuses on what it takes to make small-scale farming economically viable, offering marketing and business-planning guidance, as well as tips on how to pursue "out of the box" ideas like marketing to restaurants.
</p>
<p>
  A compendium of the latest marketing ideas and strategies compiled by instructors in UCSC's highly regarded Farm & Garden Apprenticeship Program, the manual offers lessons to farmers, instructors, and others with direct-marketing outlets, including urban farms, community gardens, and food projects.
</p>
<p>
  The manual covers farm and business planning, selling at farmers' markets, direct marketing at a roadside farm stand, and a full exploration of community-supported agriculture (CSA), which has been a boon to many small growers.
</p>
<p>
  The publication, <i>Teaching Direct Marketing and Small Farm Viability: Resources for Instructors</i>, is a companion volume to CASFS's first training manual, <i>Teaching Organic Farming and Gardening: Resources for Instructors.</i>
</p>
<p>
  "Growing quality produce is at the heart of farming, but there's much more that goes into making a farm successful over the long term," said CASFS director Carol Shennan. "We saw a real need for a publication that would address the business aspects of farming."
</p>
<p>
  From finding land and planning what crops to grow, to marketing crops and managing farm income and expenses, <i>Teaching Direct Marketing and Small Farm Viability</i> covers it all. Three sections focus on marketing, while other sections cover land-use options, including cash-rent leases from nonprofits, shared ownership models, conservation easements, and community land trusts. A general review of small farm viability is also included.
</p>
<p>
  The manual may be downloaded for free as a PDF from the <a href="http://zzyx.ucsc.edu/casfs/index.html">CASFS web site</a>. It is also available in print for $25, plus $4 for domestic shipping; please send e-mail to <a href="mailto:TrainingManual@ucsc.ed">TrainingManual@ucsc.edu</a> for details on how to order a printed copy.
</p>
<p>
  The manual was made possible by funding from the True North Foundation, the Foundation for Sustainability and Innovation, and the Organic Farming Research Foundation.

        <title>Engineering professor leads an emerging research front</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_5535" align="alignright" width="160"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/03/milanfar_p_05-03-14.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-5535" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/03/milanfar_p_05-03-14.jpg" alt="Peyman Milanfar Photo: Sina Farsiu" width="160" height="229" /></a>Peyman Milanfar Photo: Sina Farsiu[/caption]
<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  Peyman Milanfar, an associate professor of electrical engineering, coauthored a paper in 2001 that represents an emerging research front in the field of engineering, according to an analysis by Thomson ISI, a Philadelphia-based company that specializes in analyzing scientific literature.
</p>
<p>
  The paper described a new technique for producing a high-resolution image from a set of low-resolution images (see <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/currents/00-01/05-07/images.html">earlier Currents story.)</a>
</p>
<p>
  Since its publication, the paper has been cited by other researchers across multiple disciplines so frequently that it stood out in an ISI analysis designed to identify emerging research fronts in different fields.
</p>
<p>
  An interview with Milanfar discussing the paper and its significance can be found on the <a href="http://esi-topics.com/erf/2005/february05-PeymanMilanfar.html">ISI web site</a>. The ISI web site also provides a detailed description of the <a href="http://esi-topics.com/RFmethodology.html">methodology</a> the company uses to identify emerging research fronts. The basic concept is described as follows:
</p>
<p>
  "Research areas in science, particularly those at the cutting edge of their fields, are characterized by patterns of intense communication between scientists. This communication manifests itself in various ways, both formally and informally, but prominent among these are citations from one scientist's work to another.
</p>
<p>
  Patterns of citation reflect a fine-grained selection process of how scientists build on each other's work, and the relationship of these works to one another. Such patterns can be used to create a picture of the state of a specific research area in terms of the papers that constitute its core of seminal work."
</p>
<p>
  Milanfar's coauthors on the paper were Nhat Nguyen, then at KLA Tencor, and Gene Golub of Stanford University. Milanfar said that since 2001, he and his students and collaborators have improved on the methods described in the original paper, and interest in the subject has grown to the point where special conferences are now held for researchers in this area.<br>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_5533" align="alignright" width="230"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/03/moregreeting.05-03-14.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-5533" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/03/moregreeting.05-03-14.jpg" alt="Chancellor Denton greets staffers after speaking at the winter-quarter forum.

<p>
  During her first forum with staff, Chancellor Denice D. Denton expressed strong support for campus employees and emphasized that she will become more informed and involved with their issues.
</p>
<p>
  "I believe staff are the people who really make universities run," Denton told the crowd that filled Kresge Town Hall last week.
</p>
<p>
  "Staff have a core focus on the place that is different from that of students and different from that of faculty. They really think about the place and how to make the place better."<br>
</p>
<p>
  An overflow crowd turned out for the chancellor's first brown-bag forum since she took office on February 14, repeatedly greeting Denton's comments with applause on an unseasonably warm day that prompted Denton to quip, "I'm lovin' it here. I'm jealous of the group out on the patio. They get to sit outside."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Denton credited staff members with easing her transition and responded to a question about her support of represented employees by describing her role negotiating labor contracts during her tenure at the University of Washington.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Denton, who was chair of the College of Engineering at UW before taking the UCSC job, said she and the vice president of human resources negotiated 22 contracts with 15 unions in less than a year, including a contract with the United Auto Workers that covered graduate students and research assistants. She attributed their success to strong relationships, solid preparation, and a common goal.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "After all, don't both management and labor want things to be great on campus? I think so," she said. "Let's start there."<br>
  Acknowledging that labor contracts in the UC system are negotiated at the systemwide level, Denton nevertheless made it clear that she sees advocating for staff as part of her job.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "I've got to learn what a chancellor's role is vis-a-vis labor in this environment, and I'm on it," said Denton. "I'm working on it. It's a top priority. I'm going to be involved. I want to be involved."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Denton was also asked about the controversy over comments by Harvard President Lawrence Summers, who suggested at an academic conference that women are underrepresented in science and engineering because of innate differences in their abilities.
</p>
<p>
  Denton, who attended the conference and has been an outspoken critic of Summers' comments, said the media storm has created a "global teachable moment" to reject, once and for all, the "centuries-long strategy" of using pseudo-science to dismiss entire groups of people as inferior.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "You do have to pick a side on this story, and then do something about it," said Denton, who reiterated her commitment to increasing diversity at the University of California to ensure that everyone has access to the opportunities made available by higher education.<br>
</p>
<p>
  During introductory remarks, Denton mentioned that the people and "core values" of the campus, as well as its long history of interdisciplinary scholarship, are among the things that attracted her to UCSC.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "I really sincerely believe we can do great things here--continue to do great things," she said, noting her desire to "build on our progressive traditions" and expand educational opportunities for everyone.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Denton reiterated her commitment to UCSC's reputation for excellence in "student-centered undergraduate education," which she intends to "move to the next level by enhancing graduate education."<br>
</p>
<p>
  "When you expand graduate education, you're expanding undergraduate education--you have more mentors in the shop," she said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  In addition, Denton expressed a desire to increase UCSC's "family friendliness," expand the availability of child care on campus and in the community, improve "work-life balance" for employees, and engage the community in the campus's long-range planning process.

<p>
  Thirty composers, 15 ensembles, and more than 100 performers will be featured in the 2005 Pacific Rim Music Festival--a nine-day international celebration that will be presented by the UCSC Music Department from April 29 to May 7.
</p>
<p>
  Highlights of the festival include a celebration of composer Terry Riley's 70th birthday featuring the Kronos Quartet and tabla virtuoso Zakir Hussain at the Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium; an evening with the Berkeley Symphony conducted by internationally renowned conductor (and UCSC alumnus) Kent Nagano at the Music Center Recital Hall; and guest performances by Japan's celebrated pianist Aki Takahashi.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Festivities will kick off on the afternoon of April 29 with a parade and outdoor performance in downtown Santa Cruz by the Korean Folk Percussion Ensemble (Samulnori), a group of 20 performers from Korea. The ensemble will be met at the UCSC campus by percussion ensembles from UC Berkeley and Stanford as the procession makes its way to the university's arts complex.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "It will be a really grand opening," noted Hi Kyung Kim, UCSC professor of music and artistic director of the festival. "When all three groups reach the Music Center Plaza on campus, they will be joined by the UCSC Gamelan Ensembles."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Later that evening, San Francisco's Ensemble Parallele will be joined by guest mezzo-soprano Mutsumi Hatano, pipa (lute) virtuoso Wu Man, and violinist Young-Nam Kim for an opening concert titled <i>Hun Qiao (Bridge of Souls) Remembrance, Reconciliation and Peace</i>--a program created in response to modern wartime atrocities. "It's a very meaningful project featuring guest artists coming from Korea, China, and Japan," said Kim. "We are trying to pass the spirit of reconciliation and peace to all the countries of the Pacific Rim."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Kim added that the festival will also include performances by New York's acclaimed contemporary music ensemble, Speculum Musicae ("the most famous New Music ensemble in the United States"); Germany's EarPort ensemble; and the New Asia String Quartet during the nine-day event.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The Korean Musical Ceremony on May 6--a collaborative multimedia concert focusing on both the traditional and new music of Korea--will include Kim's own composition <i>Rituel III.</i> This concert features some of Korea's major performing artists such as dancer/choreographer Aeju Lee (honored as one of Korea's National Intangible Treasures), daegeum (bamboo flute) master Jeong Seung Kim, and gayageum (zither) master Byung Ki Hwang.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "That particular performance will also be on tour to Disney Hall in Los Angeles on May 11 and will be the opening event of the San Francisco International Arts Festival on May 18 at the Palace of Fine Arts Theater," Kim noted.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The 2005 Pacific Rim Music Festival will close on May 7 with Kent Nagano conducting the Berkeley Symphony in a sneak preview of the world premiere of <i>Manzanar: An American Story.</i> The piece is named for one of the 10 Japanese American internment camps during World War II and reflects upon freedom and civil liberty in America. The Santa Cruz preview will also feature the UCSC Concert Choir and be narrated.<br>
</p>
<p>
  In addition to music and dance, the festival will include four different symposia, including a topic on Japanese musical development, as well as eight special lectures by visiting composers that are all free and open to the public. Kim said that students are planning to attend these sessions from Australia and Korea, as well as from a variety of different UC campuses.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "We are very excited about promoting international collaborations between new and traditional cultures through this festival," Kim noted.
</p>
<p>
  "Our ultimate goal is to establish a Pacific Rim Cultural Center and Korean Music Center at UC Santa Cruz."<br>
  <br>

        <title>Campus transit service changes for spring</title>

<p>
  Several service reductions are being implemented at the beginning of spring quarter to improve operating efficiencies and reduce operating costs.<br>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Eliminating the shopper shuttle</b>. The average nightly ridership on the shopper shuttle has declined more than 35 percent during 2004-05 when compared with 2003-04. TAPS shuttle staff have confirmed that much of the remaining ridership occurs between on-campus destinations, with only minimal nightly ridership to off-campus destinations. Anecdotal information suggests several causes for this decline, including introduction of the "mandatory meal plan" program for all residential students, increased SCMTD transit service to Western Drive via Route 20 buses, and greater student use of Trader Joe's, the downtown New Leaf Market, and other commercial services in proximity to the Metro Center.<br>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Reduce night shuttle frequencies Friday, Saturday, and Sunday</b>. Night shuttle ridership on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday drops off dramatically when compared with Monday through Thursday nights. During February, Friday night ridership was 33 percent less than the seven-day nightly average, while Saturday and Sunday night ridership was nearly 70 percent below the seven-day nightly average. Moreover, TAPS shuttle staff have indicated that late night ridership (after 12:15 a.m.) on the Night Core route is "almost nonexistent."
</p>
<p>
  In response, TAPS has made the following changes:

        <title>Energy savings net $13,264 check for Colleges and University Housing Services</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 14 Mar 2005 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>

        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  Colleges and University Housing Services has received a $13,264 check from Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) as part of an energy-saving partnership.
</p>
<p>
  The amount represents 50 percent of the total refund of $26,528 earned by upgrading existing lighting to more energy-efficient fixtures. CUHS will receive the balance upon completion of the project later this month. The energy-saving project is a cooperative effort of CUHS Facilities, Physical Plant and Dining Services.
</p>
<p>
  In addition to the rebate, CUHS will continue to realize significant returns as energy costs decline, along with the added benefit of conserving resources.
</p>
<p>
  Funding for the program comes from a $12 million PG&E grant to the University of California and California State University campuses. UCSC was the first UC or CSU campus to receive payment under the program. (See earlier <a href="http://currents.ucsc.edu/04-05/12-06/rebate.asp">Currents story</a>)

        <title>Catalog updates to be posted online</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  With the concurrence of both academic and administrative units, UCSC published the first two-year (biennial) edition of its printed course catalog in 2004--<a href="http://reg.ucsc.edu/catalog/"><i>UC Santa Cruz General Catalog, 2004-06</i></a><i>.</i> Previously, the catalog had been printed on an annual basis.
</p>
<p>
  <img align="right" height="231" src="../art/catalog_cover.180.jpg" width="180" alt="">Although the catalog will not be printed again until summer 2006, an online catalog update will be posted this summer to reflect significant changes affecting the 2005-06 academic year. As stated in the original <a href="http://reg.ucsc.edu/catalog/pdf/Biennial%20Catalog%20Powerpoint.pdf">proposal for a biennial catalog,</a> this interim-year update will communicate important changes to programs, courses, fees, and admission and graduation requirements, as well as other significant changes.
</p>
<p>
  The <a href="http://reg.ucsc.edu/catalog/"><i>2004-06 General Catalog</i></a> will remain archived, as published, online in both PDF and HTML formats. Because the HTML version of the archived catalog contains live links to office, division, research unit, departmental, and other web pages, all units are encouraged to keep their respective web sites as up-to-date and accurate as possible.

        <title>Friends of Long Marine Lab will honor photographer Frans Lanting with Global Oceans Award</title>

<p>
  The Friends of Long Marine Lab will present a Global Oceans Award to renowned nature photographer and conservationist Frans Lanting at the group's annual Gourmet Dinner benefit event on Sunday, March 20. The award recognizes Lanting for his outstanding contributions to public awareness of the natural environment.
</p>
<p>
  Awards will also be presented to two promising marine sciences students at UCSC. The Global Oceans Awards were established in 2004 to recognize outstanding individuals who are making a difference for the world's oceans.
</p>
<p>
  UCSC Chancellor Denice D. Denton will be a special guest at the Gourmet Dinner, which raises funds for the education programs at the Seymour Marine Discovery Center. The dinner, held this year at the Bittersweet Bistro in Rio Del Mar, has long been one of the most popular fundraising events for the Friends of Long Marine Lab. The event will be hosted this year by the proprietors of the Bittersweet Bistro, chef Thomas Vinolus and his wife Elizabeth.
</p>
<p>
  Lanting, a photographer-in-residence at <i>National Geographic</i> magazine, has been hailed as one of the great nature photographers of our time. He portrays wild creatures as ambassadors for the preservation of complete ecosystems, and his many publications have increased worldwide awareness of endangered ecological treasures in the far corners of the Earth. Lanting serves on the National Council of the World Wildlife Fund and is a UCSC Foundation trustee.
</p>
<p>
  Olivia Cheriton and Itchung Cheung, both graduate students in ocean sciences, will also receive awards at the dinner. They had the top-ranked proposals among the 19 students who received research support from the Friends of Long Marine Lab Student Research Awards this year. These awards provided more than $11,000 in total funding for undergraduate and graduate student research projects in the marine sciences.
</p>
<p>
  Cheriton is studying the dynamics of thin layers of ocean water in Monterey Bay that are associated with the periodic upwelling of cold, deep water and subsequent "relaxation" events. These oceanographic conditions play a significant role in the life cycles of various species of rockfish. Cheriton is working with Margaret McManus, who was an assistant professor of ocean sciences at UCSC and is now at the University of Hawaii.
</p>
<p>
  Cheung, who works with professor of ocean sciences Mary Silver, is studying harmful algal blooms. In particular, he is investigating possible marine toxin contamination in dungeness and rock crabs in Monterey Bay.
</p>

<p>
  Staff of campus Dining Services garnered awards in local and regional culinary competitions this winter.
</p>
<p>
  Three teams of UCSC cooks entered the Santa Cruz Chowder Cook-Off, held annually in February at the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk. The teams, calling themselves the Redwood Sluggers, Restaurant at UCEN, and the Chowder Slugs, prepared and served close to 50 gallons of chowder.
</p>
<p>
  The Chowder Slugs, led by executive chef Dwight Collins, with team members Bill Prime and Wade Garza, won three awards for their New England clam chowder: first place in the Corporate Division, third place for Overall Most Tasted, and grand prize as the People's Choice.
</p>
<p>
  Julie Mitravich, manager of University Catering, came away with a bronze medal in the Culinary Challenge competition at the regional meeting of the National Association of College and University Food Services at Stanford University last month.
</p>
<p>
  Mitravich competed against 10 other executive chefs from the Pacific Region and won the bronze with her entree of lamb loin wrapped in red chard with a pomegranate and fresh rosemary glaze, lemon thyme barley risotto, and organic beets.
</p>
<p>
  Mitravich joined the Dining Services team last year when the campus transitioned from Sodexho to self operation.

<p>
  Professor of ocean sciences Mary Silver will give the annual Faculty Research Lecture at UCSC on Thursday, March 10. Her lecture, titled "A Naturalist's View: Toxic Algae in the Coastal Ocean," will begin at 8 p.m. in the Colleges Nine and Ten Multipurpose Room. The event is free and open to the public. A reception will be held at the University Center after the lecture.
</p>
<p>
  An internationally recognized leader in biological oceanography, Silver has been highly influential through her research and teaching. Her findings have affected research directions for the entire field of oceanography and have often caused the oceanographic community to rethink and change the prevailing wisdom of the time.<br>
</p>
<p>
  In recent years, Silver has been studying one of the most pressing issues of ocean health: harmful algal blooms caused by toxin-producing marine phytoplankton (microscopic algae). When other organisms eat the toxic algae, the toxins can move through the marine food web, poisoning marine mammals and seabirds and accumulating in fish and shellfish that may be harvested for human consumption. This issue is receiving increased attention because of growing human populations near the coasts, increasing human consumption of marine food sources, and more frequent and widespread occurrence of harmful algal blooms.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Silver's research on harmful algal blooms focuses on determining the environmental conditions that lead to toxin production by phytoplankton and understanding the pathways by which these toxins are transmitted to higher organisms, including humans.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Silver joined the UCSC faculty in 1972, and she was a founding member and leading developer of the campus's highly respected program in ocean sciences. She is probably best known for her studies of "marine snow" that began in the mid-1970s. The small flocs and flakes of nonliving particles that drift down through the water like snow had been ignored by other scientists until Silver decided to take a close look at them. She showed that marine snow is a major source of sinking organic matter in the world's oceans and that it is the site of intense microbial activity.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Silver's findings on marine snow had a major impact on the basic understanding of the way that decomposition and nutrient regeneration processes occur in the ocean and the ways in which microbial populations interact. This work resulted in the first estimates of the abundance of marine snow and the communities of microorganisms that inhabit it. It also showed that many planktonic organisms thought to be "free-living" actually reside on particles. Because these organisms are abundant and active, the particles are actually semi-isolated microhabitats for dense and unique microbial communities.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "Silver's collective body of work on marine snow stands out as one of the great individual contributions in modern biological oceanography," wrote the committee of the UCSC Academic Senate that recommended her as this year's Faculty Research Lecturer.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Silver has received many awards and honors in recognition of her accomplishments, including the Mary Sears Woman Pioneer in Oceanography Award in 2002 and the Henry Bryant Bigelow Award in Oceanography in 1992, both awarded by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. She received the 1995-96 Outstanding Faculty Award from UCSC's Division of Physical and Biological Sciences, was elected as a fellow of the California Academy of Sciences in 1997, and was selected by the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary to give the 2001 Ricketts Memorial Lecture.<br>
</p>
<p>
  A popular teacher, Silver has taught well over 4,000 students in her years at UCSC and has sponsored and encouraged many young marine biologists and oceanographers. She received her bachelor's degree in zoology from UC Berkeley and her Ph.D. in oceanography from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego.<br>

        <title>New chair of Philosophy Department stresses interdisciplinary links between philosophy and science</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_5517" align="alignright" width="170"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/03/roth.05-03-07.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-5517" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/03/roth.05-03-07.jpg" alt="New Philosophy Department chair Paul Roth Photo: Scott Rappaport" width="170" height="241" /></a>New Philosophy Department chair Paul Roth Photo: Scott Rappaport[/caption]
<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  While teaching at the University of Missouri-St. Louis in the late 1990s, Paul Roth cofounded an annual roundtable on the philosophy of social science that reflects his avid interest in the interrelationships of social science and philosophy.
</p>
<p>
  Now in its seventh year, the event has become a thriving institution featuring frequent guest speakers from Europe and diverse contributions from around the world. This year's roundtable takes place on March 11-13 at Barnard College of Columbia University.
</p>
<p>
  "It was like a field of dreams--we built it and people came," said Roth, newly hired this past fall as the chair of the UCSC Philosophy Department.
</p>
<p>
  "It has had the desired effect of creating a new center of discussion for this particular area. We put out a call for papers, but we don't select the topic. So we learn what it is that people are collectively writing and thinking about."
</p>
<p>
  "The theoretical flow used to be exclusively from the natural sciences to the social sciences," Roth observed. "But ideas that originated in the social sciences such as game theory (mathematical ways of modeling human decision making) are now being used in the biological sciences in such areas as the study of evolutionary change."
</p>
<p>
  Roth added that recent revelations--such as that research studies of heart patients do not reflect the different effects of drugs and treatment on women--also refute the myth that the natural world is viewed with an unbiased eye by scientists.
</p>
<p>
  "Scientists, like any other human beings, can wear cultural blinders and this can influence how they do their research," Roth explained.
</p>
<p>
  "Scientists might be developing skewed results by not taking into account sex biases that they are unaware of and never thought to look for. We can help make natural scientists aware of what those cultural blinders might be."
</p>
<p>
  "This is all grist for the philosopher," Roth added. "Because the philosopher's perennial question is: 'Why is science successful?' A stock answer is because it uses the scientific method. But I'm saying that method needs to be constantly examined."
</p>
<p>
  Roth said that there does not appear to be a single scientific method but instead different techniques and theories that work in different fields of science.
</p>
<p>
  "I am skeptical that one could come up with a generic formulation of the scientific method," said Roth. "Is there a reasonable extrapolation that one size fits all? When you find out what goes on in the various fields of science, you find that each has a different way of proceeding. In my view, we want to have a rich understanding of what research is--the pitfalls, the complexities, and all the connecting research agendas and resource limitations--and still get the powerful results. So I see us involved in understanding, and to possibly facilitate, the work of science."

<p>
  "The Secrets of Nature," a lecture series featuring UCSC faculty and alumni, will be presented by the <a href="http://www.santacruzmuseums.org">Santa Cruz Museum Association</a> in March.
</p>
<p>
  All the lectures will be held on Mondays at 7 p.m. at the Louden Nelson Community Center, 301 Center St., in Santa Cruz.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Salamander secrets are the subject of the first lecture,<br>
  "Giants, Toxic Newts, Tigers and Long-toes: A Journey to the Wonderful World of Salamanders" by Barry Sinervo, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology.
</p>
<p>
  Sinervo's presentation will include discussion of his work on species from the campus, including the campus caves system. Information on Sinervo's research is available on his <a href="http://biosci.ucsc.edu/faculty/sinervo.html">web site.</a><br>
</p>
<p>
  On March 14, plant ecologist and UCSC graduate Jodi M. McGraw will speak on "Secrets of the Sandhills: A Biodiversity Hotspot." McGraw is a freelance biologist on a variety of endangered species conservation projects in central coastal California, including sandhills preservation and management plans. She is president of the Sandhills Alliance for Natural Diversity (S.A.N.D.), a local conservation organization.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "Slug Secrets: Sex and Speciation," is the topic of a March 21 lecture by emeritus professor of biology John Pearse and Jan Leonard, a postdoctoral researcher in Pearse's lab. Pearse delivered the Emeriti Faculty Lecture at UCSC in 2004, and information on his research is available at<br>

<p>
  The advent of online databases to access the human genome has been a boon to biomedical research, and the usefulness of this information has just moved to a new level.
</p>
<p>
  Researchers at UCSC, the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI), the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (WTSI) in Great Britain have released the results of a project to identify a core set of genes that can be located in the human genome and have been validated as coding for proteins.<br>
</p>
<p>
  After more than a year of work, the collaboration has released a set of 14,795 genes that can be reliably said to code for a protein. This gene set, called the Consensus Coding Sequence (CCDS) set, was posted March 2 on the three major public human genome browsers: the <a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu">UCSC Genome Browser</a>, the <a href="http://www.ensembl.org">Ensembl Browser</a> at EBI and WTSI, and the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/CCDS">NCBI web site</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The CCDS set is built by consensus among the collaborating members at UCSC, NCBI, EBI, and WTSI. UCSC's involvement in this international collaboration is led by David Haussler, professor of biomolecular engineering and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator.
</p>
<p>
  "Now that biomedical science has an internationally accepted human genome reference sequence to work from, it's time to identify a corresponding reference set of human genes from that genome," Haussler said.
</p>
<p>
  The CCDS project addresses the fact that the genes listed in human genome databases often are not entirely validated, and the same gene may have different names in different databases. Since the data characterizing the genes come from a variety of sources, researchers are not always certain that a listed gene is real and its stated function is accurate.
</p>
<p>
  The CCDS genes have been given unique identifier and version numbers to help locate them on genome maps. Each of the genome browser sites will receive regular updates as the collaboration continues to refine its knowledge of the protein-coding genes.
</p>
<p>
  Until the Human Genome Project succeeded in sequencing and assembling the entire human genome, researchers could sequence the DNA in a gene, but had no way to accurately determine its location in the genome. Once the genome was sequenced, researchers began to note which parts of the genome contained known genes, a process known as genome annotation.
</p>
<p>
  Haussler's group at UCSC pioneered the use of a mathematical approach known as hidden Markov models as a way to find genes in DNA sequences using automated computer programs. The technique is now widely used for this purpose, but Haussler said the problem of finding all the genes in the DNA sequence of the human genome has proven to be "much more difficult than we ever imagined."
</p>
<p>
  "It will take the coordinated efforts of experimentalists and computational biologists many more years to complete this task," he said.
</p>
<p>
  The CCDS set is calculated following coordinated whole genome annotation updates carried out by NCBI and Ensembl. Annotation updates represent genes that are defined by a mixture of manual curation, carried out by the WTSI Havana team and the NCBI RefSeq group, and automated computational processing performed by groups at Ensembl and NCBI.
</p>
<p>
  "Resolving inconsistencies between gene structures generated by complementary methods of manual curation and automatic annotation is a major step towards providing stable and accurate annotation that can be relied on by researchers," said Tim Hubbard, head of human genome analysis at WTSI.
</p>
<p>
  According to Mark Diekhans, the lead researcher on this project from the UCSC Genome Bioinformatics Group, inconsistencies arise because different centers have used different methods to identify where genes reside. "The names and locations do not always agree, especially in cases where the gene's function isn't well understood," Diekhans said.
</p>
<p>
  As a result, the huge gene databases contain genes that appear to be duplicates or are quite similar, either in their DNA sequences or in their expression in the living organism. Having the entire human genome assembled and viewable with online browsers presents an opportunity for researchers to find each gene sequence in its correct location on the chromosomes and determine, for example, if one gene has been given two different names, or if they are in fact separate genes.
</p>
<p>
  The UCSC contribution to the CCDS project has been mostly quality control, Diekhans said. "We compared the gene sets postulated by NCBI and Sanger to find the intersections between them. Then we applied various bioinformatics approaches to find where the sequences in this intersecting set might not actually be protein-coding," he said.
</p>
<p>
  One approach the UCSC group used was to compare the intersecting set to a list of likely pseudogenes, elements in the DNA sequence that appear to be genes but cannot be transcribed to form proteins. These pseudogenes were predicted by software developed at UCSC by graduate student Robert Baertsch. Sequences that appeared to be pseudogenes were removed from consideration for the CCDS set, and any removed sequence will likely undergo more study before it is finally accepted as a gene or ruled out.
</p>
<p>
  The UCSC team also compared the intersecting set with analogous locations on the genomes of other organisms--chimpanzee, chicken, dog, mouse, rat, and rhesus monkey. These comparisons between species aid in gene validation. "When gene segments are conserved across multiple species, it indicates that they are likely to be real and not pseudogenes," Diekhans said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The UCSC Genome Browser makes comparative genomics much simpler, because it allows side-by-side comparisons of analogous genome segments from various species.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "Comparing human genes to the genes of related species will be the key to finalizing the human gene set," Haussler said. "All of biology is the result of evolution. Genes cannot be fully apprehended outside of their evolutionary context."<br>
</p>
<p>
  The collaborating groups used a conservative process in establishing the CCDS set. "We were going for high quality and high confidence," Diekhans said. "When in doubt about a gene, we left it out of our set. This makes the CCDS a valuable reference set for disease research."
</p>
<p>
  In addition to Diekhans and Haussler, the UCSC team includes Adam Siepel, Robert Baertsch, Fan Hsu, Chuck Sugnet, and the entire UCSC Genome Browser team, led by Jim Kent. Lead researchers at collaborating institutions include David Lipman, Jim Ostell, and Kim Pruitt at NCBI; Hubbard, Richard Durbin, Steve Searle, and Jennifer Ashurst at WTSI; and Ewan Birney at EBI.
</p>
<p>
  "UCSC is very proud to be playing a role in this collaboration with such outstanding collaborators as NCBI, EBI, and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute," Haussler said.<br>

        <title>Films can make a difference, says critic B. Ruby Rich</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_5510" align="alignright" width="230"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/03/rich_b_ruby.05-03-07.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-5510" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/03/rich_b_ruby.05-03-07.jpg" alt="B.

<p>
  When film critic B. Ruby Rich goes to the movies, she's not looking for big stars and Hollywood glitz. She's looking for cutting-edge technique and a message that speaks to the times.
</p>
<p>
  "I'm always looking for work that is exciting to me, that represents a new front in filmmaking," said Rich, who joined the faculty last fall as an assistant professor of community studies.
</p>
<p>
  "And I'm looking for films that make sense of a cultural moment."<br>
</p>
<p>
  So forget <i>Million Dollar Baby</i> and think <i>Tarnation,</i> an autobiographical documentary made for less than $250 by Jonathan Caouette, who began chronicling his life at the age of 11. Caouette combined Super-8 home movies, snapshots, old answering machine messages, and early short films into a film that one writer called "part documentary, part narrative fiction, part home movie, and part acid trip."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Rich, who writes about film for the <i>Guardian</i> of London, the <i>San Francisco Bay Guardian, Sight & Sound,</i> the <i>Village Voice,</i> and other publications, has been on the jury of film festivals from Toronto to Havana, Sydney to Guadalajara. She has participated in the Sundance Film Festival since 1987, regularly attends Cannes, and is an expert on Latin American film and queer cinema.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The author of the 1998 book <i>Chick Flicks: Theories and Memories</i> <i>of the Feminist Film Movement</i> and countless scholarly and popular articles about film, Rich is currently working on her next book, entitled "The Rise and Fall of New Queer Cinema," which documents the emergence in the early 1990s of "amazing new films" by film makers including Todd Haynes, Sadie Benning, Derek Jarman, and Isaac Julien.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "Their films were unlike anything I'd ever seen before, with such a different style," said Rich, who coined the phrase "new queer cinema" in a 1992 article in the <i>Village Voice.</i> "They were unapologetic, and they wanted their films to be for all audiences."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Films like <i>Poison, Go Fish,</i> and <i>High Art</i> began showing up at film festivals and winning prizes, and careers were born. That powerful new wave of queer cinema came out of a decade of organizing around AIDS, when people turned their attention to culture and cinema, said Rich. But that momentum of the early '90s has been lost. What's left constitutes the "worst nightmare" of those film pioneers, said Rich, referring to the "commodification and assimilation" of queer cinema evident in television shows like <i>Queer Eye for the Straight Guy</i> and <i>Will and Grace.</i><br>
</p>
<p>
  "The 1990s were a much more hopeful political moment," said Rich, who loves film's "potential to make a difference."<br>
</p>
<p>
  "I really do believe film is the literature of our time," she said. "Ideas get played out on screen, and we identify with the characters we see. Film today is a secular religion. People's experience of the world is often mediated through movies."<br>
</p>
<p>
  To that end, when Rich watches mainstream Hollywood movies, it's for what they reveal about U.S. culture, and she monitors them with a critical eye for what they offer audiences. Last year, she was struck by the plethora of "revenge films," including <i>Mystic River, Kill Bill,</i> and <i>21 Grams,</i> and wrote a piece about the shortcomings of U.S. film in the post-9/11 era, when instead of revenge, filmmakers had an opportunity to focus on "regret."<br>
</p>
<p>
  "Every once in a while, I get so fed up that I have to write something," said Rich, adding that she thinks international cinema is becoming more important than ever as the United States becomes more xenophobic. Online DVD movie rental services like Netflix are "a dream come true" because they make watching movies "as easy as getting a book from the library" and expand the reach of low-budget, independent films and international cinema, she said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Rich will teach Community Studies147, <i>The Rise and Fall of the New Queer Cinema,</i> this spring and looks forward to the arrival in September of the first students in the new community studies master's program in social documentation. Having made her living through film since she was an undergraduate at Yale--when she sold popcorn at Film Society screenings to pay the rent--Rich is hopeful about the future of film. Just don't get her started on the Oscars.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "My friends forced me to watch," she said with a laugh. "I hated it, just like always."
</p>
<p>
  Here is a short list of recent movies that Rich recommends:<br>
</p>
<p>
  * <i>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</i><br>
  * <i>Bad Education</i><br>
  * <i>Maria Full of Grace</i><br>
  * <i>Control Room</i><br>
  * <i>The Corporation</i><br>
  * <i>Gunner Palace</i><br>
  * <i>Mondovino</i><br>
  * <i>The Holy Girl (La Nina Santa)</i><br>

<p>
  The UC Santa Cruz Predatory Bird Research Group has set up a camera to monitor a pair of peregrine falcons nesting on the headquarters building of the Pacific Gas & Electric Company in downtown San Francisco.
</p>
<p>
  The peregrine "nest cam" offers visitors to the group's <a href="http://www.scpbrg.org">web site</a> the chance to watch the nesting peregrines live on the Internet.<br>
</p>
<p>
  PBRG researchers installed a nesting box on the 33rd floor ledge of the PG&E building in 1987 after peregrine falcons were seen perching on the building. Last year, a pair of peregrines nested in the box and produced two offspring, which successfully fledged. The pair is nesting again this year, and have so far laid two eggs.<br>
</p>
<p>
  PG&E is making a $30,000 donation to the PBRG this year. The money will go toward the operating costs for the peregrine nest cam and the web site, and it will also help fund the group's educational outreach program.<br>

        <title>Author of Green Parrots, A War Surgeon's Diary, to speak</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  Dr. Gino Strada, author of <i>Green Parrots: A War Surgeon's Diary</i> and a cofounder of the humanitarian organization Emergency, will speak and sign his book from 7 to 9 p.m. on Wednesday, March 9, at the Veterans' Memorial Hall, 846 Front Street, Santa Cruz.
</p>
<p>
  <img align="right" height="226" src="../art/green_parrots.150.jpg" width="150" alt="">The event is sponsored by Cowell College, the Italian Studies Program, the Language Program, the Institute for Humanities Research, the Literary Guillotine, and the Resource Center for Nonviolence. The suggested donation is $5, but no one will be turned away for lack of funds. The event is open to the public.
</p>
<p>
  The Emergency organization provides medical and surgical assistance and rehabilitation to war victims, particularly to those injured by anti-personnel mines. Strada's book was recently translated into English from the original Italian and has an introduction by American historian Howard Zinn. All proceeds from the sale of Dr. Strada's book will go to support the work of Emergency.

        <title>Police must be notified of changes in locks, alarms</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 07 Mar 2005 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  If your office or building is getting new locks and keys, don't forget about the campus police. The police need to have copies of keys for all campus buildings in case emergency access is required, but sometimes this step is being overlooked.
</p>
<p>
  Those responsible for key control or making changes to a security alarm in office areas, classrooms, labs, or housing areas on campus should notify the UCSC Police Department prior to rekeying doors or making changes to alarm systems. Key and alarm changes (for current alarm service only) should be directed to Elisabet Hiatt at (831) 459-2897 or <a href="mailto:lazo@ucsc.edu">lazo@ucsc.edu</a>.

<p>
  Adam Hochschild, author of the new book <i>Bury the Chains: Prophets and Rebels in the Fight to Free an Empire's Slaves</i> will give a talk about his book on Wednesday, March 9, at 3:30 p.m. in the Cowell Conference Room.
</p>
<p>
  <i>Bury the Chains</i> begins in 1787 when a group of men gathered in a London printing shop and launched the 50-year campaign to end the British slave trade. Throughout the book Hochschild draws incisive portraits of the leaders of the anti-slavery movement and those who were against them.
</p>
<p>
  Hochschild's 1998 book, <i>King Leopold's Ghost</i>: <i>A Story of Greed, Terror, and Heroism in Colonial Africa</i>, won the California Book Awards gold medal for nonfiction, the Duff Cooper prize, and the Lionel Gelber prize, and it was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award. Hochschild's other books include <i>Half the Way Home: A Memoir of Father and Son</i> (1996); <i>The Unquiet Ghost : Russians Remember Stalin</i> (1994); and <i>The Mirror at Midnight: A South African Journey</i> (1990).
</p>
<p>
  Hochschild has also written for the <i>New Yorker</i>, <i>Harper's Magazine</i>, <i>New York Review of Books</i>, <i>New York Times Magazine, Mother Jones</i> (which he cofounded), the <i>Nation</i>, and many other magazines and newspapers. A former commentator on National Public Radio's <i>All Things Considered,</i> he teaches writing at the Graduate School of Journalism at UC Berkeley.
</p>
<p>
  The talk, which is sponsored by the Center for World History, is open to the university community. Hochschild will be signing copies of his book at the Capitola Book Cafe later the same evening.<br>

<p>
  From a toothy shark to a preening pelican, the artistic talent of dozens of students in grades K-12 will be on display at the Seymour Marine Discovery Center from March 12 through the spring.
</p>
<p>
  The public is invited to attend an awards ceremony and reception for the artists that will be held Saturday, March 12, at 2 p.m. at the <a href="http://seymourcenter.ucsc.edu">Seymour Marine Discovery</a> Center, 100 Shaffer Road, in Santa Cruz.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Nearly 300 students entered the Marine Masterpieces Student Art Contest & Exhibition, which attracted entries from as far away as Wisconsin. The names of winning artists are posted on the <a href="http://seymourcenter.ucsc.edu">Seymour Center web site</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The contest was open to individuals and groups that produced works that "communicate something about marine life/science, ocean conservation, or marine scientists." Individual winners were selected in each of four categories: K-1st grade, 2-3rd grade, 4-6th grade, and 7-12th grade.
</p>
<p>
  Winners were also selected from a separate category for group artwork.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "We had a really good response," said contest coordinator Kevin Keedy, who manages youth programs at the Seymour Center. "The artwork is fantastic."<br>
</p>
<p>
  The contest provides an opportunity for marine enthusiasts to express themselves artistically, and it encourages others to study the oceans in order to produce a work of art, said Keedy. "It's a neat way to get kids involved, and the exhibit gives the public an opportunity to see and enjoy the art," he said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  A total of 288 artists produced 236 pieces that were judged by a panel of six judges. First-place winners will receive one-year student memberships to the Seymour Center, while their teachers will receive a voucher for $100 toward a class field trip to the center; other prizes include T-shirts and books. The contest was sponsored by Don and Peggy Schmitz.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The Seymour Marine Discovery Center is dedicated to educating people about the role scientific research plays in the understanding and conservation of the world's oceans. Part of the Joseph M. Long Marine Laboratory at UCSC, the center offers exhibit halls, aquaria, touch tanks, and public tours overlooking the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_5496" align="alignright" width="170"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/03/roth.05-03-07.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-5496" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/03/roth.05-03-07.jpg" alt="New Philosophy Department chair Paul Roth Photo: Scott Rappaport" width="170" height="241" /></a>New Philosophy Department chair Paul Roth Photo: Scott Rappaport[/caption]
<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  While teaching at the University of Missouri-St. Louis in the late 1990s, Paul Roth cofounded an annual roundtable on the philosophy of social science that reflects his avid interest in the interrelationships of social science and philosophy.
</p>
<p>
  Now in its seventh year, the event has become a thriving institution featuring frequent guest speakers from Europe and diverse contributions from around the world. This year's roundtable takes place on March 11-13 at Barnard College of Columbia University.
</p>
<p>
  "It was like a field of dreams--we built it and people came," said Roth, newly hired this past fall as the chair of the UCSC Philosophy Department.
</p>
<p>
  "It has had the desired effect of creating a new center of discussion for this particular area. We put out a call for papers, but we don't select the topic. So we learn what it is that people are collectively writing and thinking about."
</p>
<p>
  "The theoretical flow used to be exclusively from the natural sciences to the social sciences," Roth observed. "But ideas that originated in the social sciences such as game theory (mathematical ways of modeling human decision making) are now being used in the biological sciences in such areas as the study of evolutionary change."
</p>
<p>
  Roth added that recent revelations--such as that research studies of heart patients do not reflect the different effects of drugs and treatment on women--also refute the myth that the natural world is viewed with an unbiased eye by scientists.
</p>
<p>
  "Scientists, like any other human beings, can wear cultural blinders and this can influence how they do their research," Roth explained.
</p>
<p>
  "Scientists might be developing skewed results by not taking into account sex biases that they are unaware of and never thought to look for. We can help make natural scientists aware of what those cultural blinders might be."
</p>
<p>
  "This is all grist for the philosopher," Roth added. "Because the philosopher's perennial question is: 'Why is science successful?' A stock answer is because it uses the scientific method. But I'm saying that method needs to be constantly examined."
</p>
<p>
  Roth said that there does not appear to be a single scientific method but instead different techniques and theories that work in different fields of science.
</p>
<p>
  "I am skeptical that one could come up with a generic formulation of the scientific method," said Roth. "Is there a reasonable extrapolation that one size fits all? When you find out what goes on in the various fields of science, you find that each has a different way of proceeding. In my view, we want to have a rich understanding of what research is--the pitfalls, the complexities, and all the connecting research agendas and resource limitations--and still get the powerful results. So I see us involved in understanding, and to possibly facilitate, the work of science."

<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  A species of microscopic algae that caused "red tides" in Monterey Bay last summer, discoloring the water and killing mussels, is still present in water samples from the bay and has the potential to cause more serious problems, according to scientists involved in a Central Coast ocean monitoring program.
</p>
<p>
  "This species has been seen before on the Central Coast, but never in the numbers we've seen in the past year, and we are still seeing it now. Its presence is so unusual and persistent, and its blooms so dense, we suspect it is signaling a change in our coastal waters," said Mary Silver, professor of ocean sciences at UCSC.<br>
</p>
<p>
  While Silver and other scientists around Monterey Bay are keeping a close eye on the situation, they noted that federal funding for the programs that support this kind of monitoring effort is increasingly uncertain.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The alga has been tentatively identified as <i>Cochlodinium catenatum,</i> a species that has caused fish kills and other damage in the coastal Pacific waters of Mexico and Central America. A closely related species, <i>C. polykrikoides,</i> has killed fish in salmon farms in Vancouver, British Columbia, and has caused severe damage to fish farms in the coastal waters of Korea, China, and Japan.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Silver's lab has been monitoring <i>Cochlodinium</i> in Monterey Bay since first noticing it in July 2004. The researchers measured concentrations of the algae as high as 50,000 cells per liter in water samples taken last summer. Where dense blooms of the algae occurred, the waters were "slimy" and foul-smelling. Although toxicologists have not isolated a specific toxin from <i>C. catenatum,</i> the slime it produces has been associated with the deaths of fish and corals in Pacific waters of Panama and Costa Rica, where blooms occurred in the 1980s, Silver said. Records from the 1960s and 1970s indicate that blooms of this organism were also noted in the San Diego area, she said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Gregg Langlois, who oversees the California Department of Health Services (CDHS) marine biotoxin monitoring program, said <i>C. catenatum</i> was first identified on the Central Coast in 1997 when it bloomed near San Luis Obispo. The recent findings in Monterey Bay were confirmed by Chris Scholin, an expert on toxic algae at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, and scientists at the Moss Landing Marine Laboratories.<br>
</p>
<p>
  As part of Silver's monitoring efforts, carried out in conjunction with Langlois's statewide program, bags of mussels are hung in the water below the Santa Cruz Wharf and checked every week to monitor for toxicity. The mussels began to die when <i>C. catenatum</i> showed up, and continued dying for about five months, Silver said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "Up until about a month ago we were still getting dead mussels," she said. "The algae produces some substance that is nasty, but it is likely to take a while for scientists to nail down exactly what that is."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Langlois said there is no evidence of any human health effects associated with <i>Cochlodinium</i> blooms. Analyses of tissue samples from affected mussels have not indicated the presence of any known algal toxins, he said.<br>

<p>
  "We're not certain what the mechanism is for the deaths of mussels, but there is no evidence that these algae produce a toxin that affects mammals or birds," Langlois said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Kenneth Coale, director of Moss Landing Marine Laboratories, said the <i>Cochlodinium</i> bloom provides a good illustration of the need for coordinated efforts to monitor ocean conditions along the coast.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "Without coastal observatories, we might have missed this until we had a major fish kill or other type of ecological damage," Coale said. "What is striking to me is that these blooms may signal coastal climate change, invasion of new species, or both. We need long-term measurements in order to understand what factors contribute to these blooms, whether they are natural or the result of human activity, and what might be done about them."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Silver's monitoring work is supported by UCSC's Center for Integrated Marine Technologies (CIMT), funded through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) as part of the agency's Coastal Ocean Technology System (COTS). But funding for CIMT, an interdisciplinary effort involving five partner institutions around Monterey Bay, has not been renewed for next year.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "The marine science institutions all around Monterey Bay are working together to organize an integrated ocean observing system for the Central Coast, and we are trying to move forward in a very uncertain funding climate," said Donald Croll, assistant professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UCSC and codirector of CIMT.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Moss Landing's Coale is involved in CIMT and also oversees a related NOAA-funded program, the Center for Integrative Coastal Observation, Research, and Education (CICORE). CIMT and CICORE are developing complementary ocean monitoring technologies as part of NOAA's efforts to establish a Central and Northern California Ocean Observing System (CeNCOOS). Establishing an integrated ocean observing system is among the key recommendations of a major report issued last year by the U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy, but funding to implement the commission's recommendations has not yet been authorized.<br>
</p>
<p>
  According to Croll, the need to implement the commission's recommendations on ocean policy will only become more urgent with increasing coastal development and growing human impacts on coastal waters.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "With a harmful algal bloom, you can't see how it develops over time unless you're out there sampling all the time," Croll said. "Because of the coordinated efforts of marine scientists around Monterey Bay, this is probably one of the most closely observed ocean ecosystems anywhere, and we want to see that continue."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Silver will be discussing her research on harmful algal blooms in a public lecture at UCSC on Thursday, March 10. (<a href="http://currents.ucsc.edu/04-05/03-07/silver.asp">See related story</a>)<br>
</p>
<p>
  On Saturday, March 12, the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary holds its annual Sanctuary Currents Symposium at California State University, Monterey Bay. This year's theme is "Tracking the Health of Our Sanctuary."

<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  Professor of ocean sciences Mary Silver will give the annual Faculty Research Lecture at UCSC on Thursday, March 10. Her lecture, titled "A Naturalist's View: Toxic Algae in the Coastal Ocean," will begin at 8 p.m. in the Colleges Nine and Ten Multipurpose Room. The event is free and open to the public. A reception will be held at the University Center after the lecture.
</p>
<p>
  An internationally recognized leader in biological oceanography, Silver has been highly influential through her research and teaching. Her findings have affected research directions for the entire field of oceanography and have often caused the oceanographic community to rethink and change the prevailing wisdom of the time.<br>
</p>
<p>
  In recent years, Silver has been studying one of the most pressing issues of ocean health: harmful algal blooms caused by toxin-producing marine phytoplankton (microscopic algae). When other organisms eat the toxic algae, the toxins can move through the marine food web, poisoning marine mammals and seabirds and accumulating in fish and shellfish that may be harvested for human consumption. This issue is receiving increased attention because of growing human populations near the coasts, increasing human consumption of marine food sources, and more frequent and widespread occurrence of harmful algal blooms.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Silver's research on harmful algal blooms focuses on determining the environmental conditions that lead to toxin production by phytoplankton and understanding the pathways by which these toxins are transmitted to higher organisms, including humans.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Silver joined the UCSC faculty in 1972, and she was a founding member and leading developer of the campus's highly respected program in ocean sciences. She is probably best known for her studies of "marine snow" that began in the mid-1970s. The small flocs and flakes of nonliving particles that drift down through the water like snow had been ignored by other scientists until Silver decided to take a close look at them. She showed that marine snow is a major source of sinking organic matter in the world's oceans and that it is the site of intense microbial activity.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Silver's findings on marine snow had a major impact on the basic understanding of the way that decomposition and nutrient regeneration processes occur in the ocean and the ways in which microbial populations interact. This work resulted in the first estimates of the abundance of marine snow and the communities of microorganisms that inhabit it. It also showed that many planktonic organisms thought to be "free-living" actually reside on particles. Because these organisms are abundant and active, the particles are actually semi-isolated microhabitats for dense and unique microbial communities.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "Silver's collective body of work on marine snow stands out as one of the great individual contributions in modern biological oceanography," wrote the committee of the UCSC Academic Senate that recommended her as this year's Faculty Research Lecturer.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Silver has received many awards and honors in recognition of her accomplishments, including the Mary Sears Woman Pioneer in Oceanography Award in 2002 and the Henry Bryant Bigelow Award in Oceanography in 1992, both awarded by the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. She received the 1995-96 Outstanding Faculty Award from UCSC's Division of Physical and Biological Sciences, was elected as a fellow of the California Academy of Sciences in 1997, and was selected by the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary to give the 2001 Ricketts Memorial Lecture.<br>
</p>
<p>
  A popular teacher, Silver has taught well over 4,000 students in her years at UCSC and has sponsored and encouraged many young marine biologists and oceanographers. She received her bachelor's degree in zoology from UC Berkeley and her Ph.D. in oceanography from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego.<br>

        <title>Seaside Company Scholarship focuses on local students</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 28 Feb 2005 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  As owner and operator of the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk, Cocoanut Grove, and other landmark properties, the Santa Cruz Seaside Company's local roots run deep. So when the company decided to endow a scholarship at UCSC, it was only natural to focus on local students.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "Many of our employees are graduates of local high schools and many went on to study at Cabrillo College and UCSC," said Charles Canfield, president of the Seaside Company. "As a graduate of Santa Cruz High School myself, I believe it is vitally important to give something back and help out local students who are trying to improve their lives through higher education."
</p>
<p>
  The new Santa Cruz Seaside Company Scholarship will give preference each year to a UCSC student who has graduated from Cabrillo College and who is also a graduate of a Santa Cruz County high school. Established with a $50,000 gift, the award will provide a $2,000 scholarship and will be based on financial need. The scholarship amount will increase as the fund continues to grow.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Locally owned and operated, the Seaside Company employs approximately 1,600 people during the summer season and is the second largest private-sector employer in the city behind Plantronics.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "My family has been living and working in Santa Cruz for generations and the Canfield family has been involved with the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk since the 1930s," said Canfield. "I've been working here since I was 16 years old."<br>
</p>
<p>
  The company already provides $500 college scholarships to 12 company employees--at various institutions--each year and contributes to many charitable groups, including the Boys and Girls Club of Santa Cruz, United Way, Cultural Council, and Omega Nu's Ducky Derby.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "To be able to create a scholarship for local students studying at UCSC is something I'm very proud of," Canfield said. "I'm very fortunate to have received a great education at local public schools as well as the University of Oregon. I want to help ensure that future generations of local students are able to pursue their dreams through education."<br>
</p>
<p>
  In addition to the Beach Boardwalk and Cocoanut Grove, the Seaside Company owns the Boardwalk Bowl, Sea & Sand Inn, Carousel Motel, and various residential/commercial properties in the City of Santa Cruz.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "The Santa Cruz Seaside Company Scholarship will help UC Santa Cruz ensure that our local students who have financial need are able to achieve their educational dreams," said Ronaldo Ramirez, director of development for Student Affairs at UCSC.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "By providing tomorrow's leaders with the assistance they need to pursue the education they deserve, this scholarship will continue to pay off for years to come," he added.<br>
</p>
<p>
  <i>To learn more about the Seaside scholarship or to establish other need-based scholarships at UCSC, please contact Ronaldo Ramirez at (831) 459-3801 or e-mail <a href="mailto:affirm@ucsc.edu">affirm@ucsc.edu</a>.</i>

<p>
  In a scathing indictment of U.S. media, <i>Democracy Now!</i> host Amy Goodman discussed the importance of independent, corporate-free media and the role it plays in democracy before a spellbound capacity crowd last week.
</p>
<p>
  "The media is absolutely essential to the functioning of a democracy," said Goodman. "It's not our job to cozy up to power. We're supposed to be the check and balance on government."
</p>
<p>
  Calling on U.S. media outlets to provide honest coverage of the war in Iraq, including footage of Iraqi civilian casualties, Goodman said she is confident that Americans would oppose the war if they saw the images that are being broadcast and published by overseas media companies.
</p>
<p>
  "I don't like the whole reality-TV craze, but I think we need some reality TV when it comes to war," said Goodman, coauthor of the best-selling book, <i>The Exception to the Rulers: Exposing Oily Politicians, War Profiteers, and the Media Who Love Them.</i>
</p>
<p>
  President Bush's executive order forbidding the publication of photographs of flag-draped coffins of U.S. military casualties is a reminder that administration officials "know the power of the image," said Goodman. "But it is not the job of the media to sanitize war."
</p>
<p>
  Goodman's lecture was presented by the UCSC Alumni Association and College Ten as part of the UCSC Distinguished Visiting Professor Series.
</p>
<p>
  Several hundred people filled the Colleges Nine and Ten Multipurpose Room for the event, during which Goodman was presented with College Ten's first Ruben Salazar Journalism Award for her "outstanding commitment to preserving the integrity of journalism."
</p>
<p>
  Salazar, a pioneering Latino journalist, was killed by a sheriff's tear-gas projectile during an anti-Vietnam War protest in East Los Angeles in 1970. An in-progress documentary about Salazar by UCSC undergraduates Leilani Montes and Victoria Fong, which was screened as part of the event, received high praise from Goodman, who told the filmmakers, "What a future you have ahead of you."
</p>
<p>
  Goodman began her career in community radio in 1985 and helped launch <i>Democracy Now!</i> in 1996. The program has helped make Pacifica Radio the largest community media collaboration in the country and built its global audience.
</p>
<p>
  Independent media is important because it presents diverse points of view and gives voice to the powerless, said Goodman. By contrast, she said, corporate-backed media in this country "silenced the majority" during the lead-up to the U.S. invasion of Iraq.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "Most people opposed this invasion, and not just those in the peace movement," said Goodman, referring to opposition at the "highest levels" of the country. "But you wouldn't know it from watching television."
</p>
<p>
  Goodman singled out the <i>New York Times,</i> which she said sets the agenda for corporate-owned media nationwide, for failing to report critically on the claims of the Bush administration before the war. The paper's impact is evident in the majority of Americans who still believe Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. "Americans aren't stupid, but if they watch television or read the papers, this is what they were told," she said.
</p>
<p>
  The media's failure to present diverse voices contributes to the vilification of entire populations, which Goodman said was evident in the abuses that took place in Iraq's Abu Ghraib Prison. "Young people growing up in this country don't hear different voices, which makes it so much easier to vilify them," she said. "Whole populations are demonized, which is why it's absolutely critical that we hear them talking."
</p>
<p>
  Even as she called for better coverage, Goodman detailed the unprecedented dangers facing journalists. On April 8, 2003, U.S. military forces in Baghdad killed three journalists and injured several others during three separate attacks that appeared to target reporters, said Goodman. Military officials claimed the attacks were in response to enemy fire, and CNN commentator Wesley Clark said the journalists had been "in the wrong place at the wrong time." But overseas media responded very differently, with hundreds of journalists in Spain memorializing their fallen colleague by turning their backs on the prime minister in Parliament and "refusing to take down the words of the powerful." Later, gathering outside the U.S. Embassy, they laid down their pens, cameras, and video cameras, entered the intersection to stop traffic, and pointed to the embassy building, yelling, "Murderer!"
</p>
<p>
  Calling the media the "most powerful institution on Earth," Goodman said, "We have to protect all journalists, and journalists have to be allowed to do their jobs."
</p>
<p>
  Goodman knows from personal experience the dangers facing journalists who choose to cover wars and high-stakes conflicts. In 1991, while in the Indonesian province of Timor to report on an investigation of human rights abuses by the Indonesian military, she was eyewitness to the massacre of 270 people by soldiers using arms supplied by the United States. Barely escaping, Goodman continued to follow events in the region, and she covered the independence of East Timor in 2002.
</p>
<p>
  "This nation of survivors had prevailed," she said, recalling the celebration on May 20, 2002. "They had resisted and won, but at an unbelievably high price."
</p>
<p>
  Because the United States is a major weapons producer, Americans have a daily responsibility to shape their country's foreign policy, said Goodman.
</p>
<p>
  "We are the most powerful country on Earth, and I believe we represent two things: the sword and the shield," she said. "The shield is the American people. People around the world rely on us to turn those guns away from them. Every hour of every day, whether a journalist or a student, a professor or a librarian... employed or unemployed, we have a decision to make every hour of every day, and that's whether to represent the sword or the shield."

        <title>Economist Dooley at center of debate over Asian investment in U.S. economy</title>

<p>
  Economist Michael Dooley is spending a lot of time explaining himself lately. That's what happens when a leading international economist becomes a vocal proponent of today's high levels of Asian investment in the U.S. economy.
</p>
<p>
  Dooley, a professor of economics, and two associates with Deutsche Bank, stand virtually alone in their analysis, but their views have triggered widespread discussion and international media attention.
</p>
<p>
  Conventional wisdom says that large U.S. fiscal and current account deficits make the U.S. vulnerable to an economic downturn: It's only a matter of time before foreign investors sour on the deficit-riddled U.S. economy and sell off dollar assets, causing interest rates to jump and the value of the dollar to plunge. The bigger U.S. deficits are at the time, the bigger the potential "shock" of a sell off.
</p>
<p>
  But Dooley argues that conventional wisdom doesn't fit today's scenario. The United States is in the midst of a "quite vigorous economic expansion," and although U.S. international borrowing is high (6 percent of gross domestic product), Asian investment actually guards against the prospect of a U.S. downturn. A constriction of credit to the United States would increase long-term interest rates and generate a "major shock," said Dooley, but a "large and meaningful block of countries in Asia" won't allow their currencies to go up, thereby assuring a steady flow of money to finance U.S. debts, he said. China is willing to fund the U.S. deficit as part of its development strategy, and that makes all the difference: "It's okay to have deficits if somebody's willing to buy your securities," he said.
</p>
<p>
  Dooley's views have been covered by the <i>Economist</i>, <i>Financial Times,</i> <i>Financial Post, Business Week,</i> the <i>San Francisco Chronicle,</i> and others, and the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank recently invited more than 30 economists--including Dooley and his Deutsche Bank coauthors--to a symposium focused on their work.
</p>
<p>
  For all the international media coverage, however, little attention has focused on what Dooley called the truly "revolutionary" aspect of this almost symbiotic relationship between the United States and Asia. Joined by Peter Garber and David Folkerts-Landau of Deutsche Bank, Dooley likens the current situation to the 1950s and '60s, when the Bretton Woods system helped war-ravaged Western European nations rebuild by pegging exchange rates to the dollar.
</p>
<p>
  Since the early 1980s, countries like Hong Kong, Taiwan, Malaysia, and Korea have purchased U.S. dollars to keep their currency undervalued, which has fueled the export-led growth that has transformed their countries. Dooley calls it a de facto economic development strategy that works.
</p>
<p>
  An expert on Latin American debt and development, Dooley has witnessed the failure of development strategies that rely on rich nations lending money to the governments of poor countries. History has shown that government protections get in the way, employment and production never take off, and the debts are never repaid, said Dooley, who sees a potential win-win scenario in the interaction today between the United States and China.
</p>
<p>
  Calling the scale of unemployment in China today "no less a problem than the Great Depression," Dooley said that as long as China remains locked into U.S. securities, the dollar will remain strong and U.S. consumers will continue to gobble up Chinese-manufactured goods. That consumption is financing China's own rapid development--employing its enormous work force, raising wages, and ultimately creating a nation of Chinese consumers with an unparalleled appetite for goods and services. Unlike the strategies that failed in Latin America, today's scenario eliminates protectionist policies and "makes developing countries compete from the start in international markets," noted Dooley.
</p>
<p>
  A successful outcome depends on rapid development in China, which Dooley projects will take a decade or so.
</p>
<p>
  "Chinese currency will rise as wages rise, and they'll be holding dollars," said Dooley. "They'll lose on those. That's why this is a transitional policy. It can't last forever. But as long as it's gradual, it doesn't have to end in a bang."
</p>
<p>
  Right now, Dooley emphasized, the priority for China's leaders is to develop their capital stock, promote high levels of direct investment, and build markets for their industrial output. "It's in their self-interest," he said.
</p>
<p>
  If, however, private speculators buy up undervalued Chinese currency, it could force the Chinese to allow the yuan to appreciate, and the impact on the U.S. economy would be "even worse than what our critics are saying," he conceded. That scenario underscores the high stakes involved, but Dooley shows no signs of unease about holding a minority viewpoint. "People don't understand enough about the history of the system they live in," he said.
</p>
<p>
  Dooley acknowledged that rapid Chinese development will trigger social and environmental problems. "But what's the alternative? Do you want 200 million unemployed Asians?" he asked. "I'd rather see them rich and prosperous, more like Japan than Argentina."
</p>
<p>
  "China and other Asian countries won't allow their currency to go up, and Argentina and Brazil are resisting the appreciation of their currency," said Dooley. "Mexico and Latin America are starting to follow the Asian model. I think it will work."

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  Dr. Gino Strada, author of <i>Green Parrots: A War Surgeon's Diary</i> and a cofounder of the humanitarian organization Emergency, will speak and sign his book from 7 to 9 p.m. on Wednesday, March 9, at the Veterans' Memorial Hall, 846 Front Street, Santa Cruz.
</p>
<p>
  <img align="right" height="226" src="../art/green_parrots.150.jpg" width="150" alt="">The event is sponsored by Cowell College, the Italian Studies Program, the Language Program, the Institute for Humanities Research, the Literary Guillotine, and the Resource Center for Nonviolence. The suggested donation is $5, but no one will be turned away for lack of funds. The event is open to the public.
</p>
<p>
  The Emergency organization provides medical and surgical assistance and rehabilitation to war victims, particularly to those injured by anti-personnel mines. Strada's book was recently translated into English from the original Italian and has an introduction by American historian Howard Zinn. All proceeds from the sale of Dr. Strada's book will go to support the work of Emergency.

<p>
  Documentary filmmaker and activist Renee Tajima-Pena will talk about her efforts to document social change and social justice issues in a free lecture for the campus community at noon on March 3 in Room D at the Bay Tree Conference Center.
</p>
<p>
  Tajima-Pena, an associate professor of community studies at UCSC, recently won a CINE Golden Eagle award for her film <i>My Journey Home</i>, which debuted on PBS last year. The two-hour documentary tells the stories of four Americans who travel to their ancestral homelands. She also won a distinguished achievement award from the International Documentary Association and an Alpert Award for the Arts for her segment of a seven-hour series titled "The New Americans," which also aired on PBS last year.
</p>
<p>
  Tajima-Pena leads UCSC's new master's degree program in social documentation, which is scheduled to enroll its first class in September 2005.
</p>
<p>
  The Diversity Lecture Series features presentations by UCSC faculty. The series is sponsored by the Equal Employment Opportunity/Affirmative Action Office. For more information, call (831) 459-5087 or send e-mail to <a href="mailto:andream@ucsc.edu">andream@ucsc.edu</a>.

<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  Decades before the Montgomery bus boycott, African Americans in Jacksonville, Florida, organized streetcar boycotts that forced the city to abandon efforts to segregate the system.
</p>
<p>
  That little-known act of rebellion is one of many instances of African Americans<br>
  organizing against white supremacy that historian Paul Ortiz, an assistant professor of community studies at UCSC, documents in his new book, <i>Emancipation Betrayed.</i>
</p>
<p>
  Handed down within black families but unknown among historians, the story of black resistance in Florida from Reconstruction until the bloody election of 1920 is an inspiring chapter of U.S. history.
</p>
<p>
  Written for a general audience, <i>Emancipation Betrayed</i> focuses on the African American struggle for voting rights while documenting networks of secret societies, fraternal organizations, labor unions, and churches that black Floridians relied on to organize and sustain themselves in the state with the highest lynching rate in the country.
</p>
<p>
  "They created the first statewide civil rights movement in U.S. history," said Ortiz. "This book is really about what happens when people are faced with political terrorism--how they challenge that and find the courage and self-confidence needed to put together a social movement."
</p>
<p>
  Through oral histories, Ortiz learned about the courageous actions of African Americans who fought for their rights, often at enormous risk to themselves and their families. Sam Dixie, an octogenarian, told of blacks taking up arms in self-defense and shared his childhood memories of a shootout in his hometown of Quincy, Florida, between blacks and the Ku Klux Klan. The Klan had found out about a secret oath taken by members of the Colored Knights of Pythias, a black fraternal organization, to fight for their rights, and Klansmen burned the lodge and killed several knights during the shootout.
</p>
<p>
  That memory was the catalyst that "completely changed my understanding of American history and social change," wrote Ortiz in the preface to <i>Emancipation Betrayed: The Hidden History of Black Organizing and White Violence in Florida from Reconstruction to the Bloody Election of 1920</i> (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2005).
</p>
<p>
  Ortiz described going "back and back" in time, picking up threads of resistance. "We are not taught to see African Americans as protagonists fighting for their own rights, but that's exactly what these people did," he said.
</p>
<p>
  Black Floridians found inspiration in the activism of their parents and grandparents. In 1901 and 1905, black residents of Jacksonville organized boycotts that forced the city to abandon efforts to segregate the streetcar system. (The system was ultimately segregated, however, with the intervention of the state legislature.) "In the long term, these organizing campaigns taught African Americans how to challenge the system," said Ortiz.
</p>
<p>
  The Colored Knights of Pythias, which at one point claimed one in six African American men in Florida as members, was a vital avenue for organizing, according to Ortiz. After World War I, the knights passed a resolution requiring each member to pay his poll tax and register to vote before the 1920 election or face expulsion. Churches and other organizations promptly followed suit. Years of organizing culminated with the 1920 presidential election in Florida, when the state sanctioned white supremacists and the Ku Klux Klan to use violence to prevent blacks from voting. Between 30 and 60 African Americans were killed, according to cautious estimates by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), and scores were wounded and displaced.
</p>
<p>
  Despite copious evidence of political terror presented during a congressional investigation, the election results were certified. The Florida movement was defeated.
</p>
<p>
  Despite the tragic outcome, the legacy of early black activism in Florida is a powerful one. With roots in the days of slavery, it set the stage for the civil rights movement of the 1960s, said Ortiz.
</p>
<p>
  "Black Floridians' courageous struggle for emancipation established the grounds for our modern expectation that all adults in the United States have the right to vote," he said. "This is a brutal part of our history, but we are the beneficiaries of their struggle and sacrifice."

<p>
  The Alexander von Humboldt Foundation of Germany has selected Piero Madau, professor of astronomy and astrophysics, to receive a prestigious Humboldt Research Award. The Humboldt Research Awards are given to internationally recognized scholars outside Germany in honor of their lifetime achievements in research. Award winners are invited to carry out research projects of their own choice with colleagues at German research institutions.
</p>
<p>
  Madau said he will use the award to conduct research in theoretical cosmology at the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics in Garching, Germany. Madau's research addresses key events in the early evolution of the universe, including the dawn of galaxies, the formation and evolution of the first massive black holes, and the reionization and metal enrichment of the intergalactic medium. The detailed history of the universe during these early formative stages remains one of the crucial missing links in studies of galaxy formation and evolution.

        <title>Teaching undergraduates to think like researchers: New approaches emerge from experimental teaching lab</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 28 Feb 2005 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_5471" align="alignright" width="230"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/02/ares_m.05-02-28.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-5471" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/02/ares_m.05-02-28.jpg" alt="Professor Manuel Ares works with students in his undergraduate teaching laboratory.

<p>
  Scientific experiments commonly yield confusing or conflicting results, and part of a researcher's job is to incorporate such findings into a coherent framework that sheds some light on the subject under investigation. But this aspect of science rarely makes it into the classroom, where students spend a lot more time on established facts and concepts than on the messy process by which those facts and concepts get established.
</p>
<p>
  That's unfortunate, because being able to evaluate conflicts and inconsistencies in scientific findings is a very useful skill for students to develop, according to Manuel Ares, professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology at UCSC.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "Even if you're not a researcher, it is helpful to have a researcher's mentality when you are trying to evaluate all the conflicting information that comes at you these days from different sources," said Ares, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Professor.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "We want to create lifelong learners and thinkers who can take information that doesn't add up and make sense of it," he said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Ares has developed a teaching exercise for undergraduate biology classes to give students a sense of how scientists proceed when valid data appear to conflict. In the course of the exercise, the students work together to resolve the apparent conflicts, while at the same time learning important concepts in molecular biology.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Ares described this teaching exercise and his experiences using it in the classroom at a symposium on science education this month at the 2005 Annual Meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) in Washington, D.C.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The exercise involves laboratory experiments to test for interactions involving certain proteins in yeast. The students also do a literature search for related information and present their findings in class. Ares chose a system in which conflicts and inconsistencies are published in the literature, and as the students present their findings they use diagrams to develop a model of the system that incorporates all the results.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "In addition to teaching the students about protein-protein interactions, this exercise seems to give students a sense of the processes scientists use to incorporate individual findings into viable intellectual constructs for understanding how biological systems work," Ares said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  This is just one example of the novel approaches to teaching science that Ares is developing in an experimental undergraduate research laboratory he established at UCSC in 2002 with support from the HHMI Professors program. He developed the protein interaction exercise during his work with students in the undergraduate research laboratory and subsequently tested and evaluated it in a regular biology class.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Another idea Ares has been exploring in his experimental teaching laboratory is how to cultivate interdisciplinary thinking in undergraduates. His thoughts on this subject can be found in a commentary published in the December 2004 issue of <i>Nature Structural & Molecular Biology.</i><br>
</p>
<p>
  "The seeds of disciplinary entrenchment are sown in undergraduate classrooms," Ares wrote.<br>
</p>
<p>
  His undergraduate research laboratory brings together students from different majors to learn about genomics by carrying out their own research projects in small groups. The 1,200-square-foot teaching lab features a wet lab and specialized equipment for molecular biology, as well as a bench loaded with computer equipment, including a dedicated network server for bioinformatics work. Computer science and bioinformatics majors work together with molecular, cell, and developmental biology majors.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Ares said he hopes to break down the cultural barriers between undergraduate majors, encourage students to think outside the disciplinary boundaries of their majors, and prepare them to be effective collaborators in the cutting-edge interdisciplinary research of the future.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "In interdisciplinary research, it may be more important to know simply how to communicate with someone in another discipline than to know that discipline intimately," he said.<br>

<p>
  In a blistering critique of Bush administration policies in Iraq, journalist Naomi Klein last week urged antiwar activists to heed the call of Iraqi voters and demand a timetable for the complete withdrawal of U.S. troops.
</p>
<p>
  "A clear majority of Iraqis want American troops to leave," Klein said, referring to the results of the January 30 elections. "The Left should be echoing the demands we're hearing from Iraq."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Klein, author of <i>No Logo: Taking Aim at the Brand Bullies,</i> is an award-winning journalist who has won praise for her coverage of the economics of the war. A capacity crowd filled the Colleges Nine and Ten Multipurpose Room to hear her talk, which was presented by the UCSC Alumni Association and College Ten as part of the UCSC Distinguished Visiting Professor Series.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The administration's pursuit of a "free-market utopia" in Iraq has backfired and its "brutal economic reforms" have fueled resentment and anger, transforming pockets of resistance into a nationwide popular uprising, said Klein.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Klein described the "amazing renaissance of democracy in Iraq" that followed the fall of Baghdad in April 2003. Hundreds of independent newspapers and journalists provided incredible coverage of the occupation, and Iraqis immediately began holding elections to establish local governing councils. "They didn't wait for anyone to tell them to do it, they just did it," said Klein. "They couldn't wait to have democracy."<br>
</p>
<p>
  But with the arrival of U.S. administrator L. Paul Bremer in May, U.S. officials pursued their real agenda in earnest under the guise of bringing democracy to Iraq, said Klein. They began slicing up the economic pie, adopting policies to protect foreign investors, laying off 500,000 Iraqis (including 400,000 soldiers who kept their guns but were stripped of their pensions), and announcing plans to sell off all 200 state-owned Iraqi companies. They negated the results of local elections, established a 15 percent flat tax (a "Republican dream," quipped Klein), and put 100 new laws on the books, including one that allowed foreign companies to own 100 percent of the assets of businesses in Iraq and take 100 percent of the profits out of the country.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Klein described attending trade shows and hearing gleeful contractors discussing their prospects in Iraq. "They were talking about opening a McDonald's and a Wal-Mart in downtown Baghdad," she recalled. "They kept saying, 'Iraqis are going to be so excited.' Reconstruction was treated as a laboratory for the free market."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Meanwhile, Iraqis saw U.S. soldiers killing civilians and arresting clerics who expressed anti-occupation views. They watched the U.S. military build permanent installations in Saddam Hussein's former palaces and read that occupation forces lost $8.8 billion in Iraqi oil money.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Likening the administration's policies in Iraq to the "Extreme Makeover" craze, Klein said U.S. officials were determined to "start over" and rebuild the country from the ground up. But things didn't go according to plan, she said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "In the early months after Baghdad fell, Iraqis used their new-found freedom to stage a protest against the occupation outside the gates of the Green Zone," said Klein. "It became clear that Iraqis wouldn't accept their shiny new country like a delighted reality-TV show contestant. National elections started to look like a very bad idea."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Indeed, increasing violence allowed U.S. administrators to delay national elections that had been scheduled for early November 2003. The delay also gave them time to "systematically lock in" their new economic policies, draft a constitution, and appoint Iraqi government leaders. One agreement hammered out by the U.S.-appointed Iraqi government and the so-called Paris Club requires that Iraq manage its $200 billion international debt in accordance with International Monetary Fund requirements that include the privatization of all state-owned companies and the replacement of the national food aid program--on which 60 percent of Iraqis depend--with a $15 individual monthly stipend, said Klein.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "All of this is totally illegal under international law," emphasized Klein.<br>
</p>
<p>
  In January 2004, 100,000 Iraqis staged a peaceful protest and called for national elections. As their protests were ignored and their pleas disregarded, Iraqis began to lose hope, and the resistance grew, widening its targets to include all foreigners and reconstruction projects themselves. Even on a "good day," there are now 40 to 50 attacks, said Klein.<br>
</p>
<p>
  In last month's election, 51 percent of Iraqi voters endorsed a platform that called for a social security system that would guarantee a job for every fit Iraqi, write off Iraqi national debts, cancel the reparations being paid to Kuwait, Britain, the United States, and other countries, and the use of Iraqi oil money for economic development, said Klein, noting that a large number of Iraqis boycotted the election to protest the occupation. The Association of Muslim Scholars urged Sunnis, who make up 20 percent of the population, to stay away from the polls, while Shi'ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr called the elections under occupation "illegitimate" and a public relations ploy. Klein called on activists to support the will of the Iraqi majority.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "You cannot leave the language of democracy to George Bush," she said. "You need to take all this hot air about freedom and democracy and force them to deliver it. If we can listen to Iraqis, we will stop future wars, because the way to stop future wars is to make war unprofitable. They want the loot--the military bases and the free-market utopia. And they haven't gotten it yet."<br>

        <title>Chancellor's Office moving to second floor of Kerr Hall</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 21 Feb 2005 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  McHenry Library's upcoming construction project is giving a crucial boost to a longtime campus goal: moving the Chancellor's Office to Kerr Hall.
</p>
<p>
  Construction is due to start on the library expansion next fall, with work to begin first in the part of the building now housing the Chancellor's Office, Assistant Chancellor William Hyder said.
</p>
<p>
  "We've all got to move. There is no other option," Hyder said, noting that those moving include vice chancellors not already at Kerr Hall and their support staff, vice povosts and their support staff, special assistants to the chancellor, and the offices of the Ombudsman and Equal Employment Opportunity/Affirmative Action. The move is scheduled for completion before fall-quarter classes begin.
</p>
<p>
  "This has been planned for a long time," said Hyder, citing some of the benefits of the move, including consolidation of administrative offices and increased conference and meeting space. "It was planned about 10 years ago but it never happened."
</p>
<p>
  Efforts to make the switch became more intense when Acting Chancellor Martin M. Chemers directed Hyder to get things moving again this past spring.
</p>
<p>
  Originally envisioned as an $8 million project involving major structural reconstruction at the 32-year-old Kerr Hall, the project has been revised and is now estimated to cost $4 million, with many maintenance projects deferred. Once planned for the fourth floor of the four-story building, the Chancellor's Office will be on the second floor because that location provides more opportunity to consolidate functions, Hyder said.
</p>
<p>
  Hyder noted that approximately $3 million of the total project costs are for actual construction, with the remainder going to various administrative and architectural costs related to a state-supported building. The project will include a new emergency generator, repairs to building plumbing, removal of some walls, waterproofing repairs, and installation of security systems. Complying with the Americans with Disabilities Act will be particularly costly, since both the ground floor and the second floor--and the elevators--will need to be accessible. The existing parking area will also be reconfigured, with tentative plans calling for a total of about 20 parking spaces near Kerr Hall when work is completed.
</p>
<p>
  Hyder praised the imagination and skill of the project's architects, the Oakland-based Glass Associates, Inc. The firm has designed other office and academic facilities at UCSC and other UC campuses. In the process of planning the project, the architects discovered a real diamond-in-the-rough in Kerr Kall: a redwood ceiling that was not being well displayed. Now being restored, the impressive ceiling will greet visitors in the new Chancellor's Office reception area.
</p>
<p>
  "I'm proud of the design," said Hyder. "Donors and members of the public will know it's a Chancellor's Office. It's going to be a welcoming place."
</p>
<p>
  In all, about 51 people will be moving into the second floor of Kerr Hall, which was emptied out as offices were relocated to the Baskin Engineering Building, and the Staff Human Resources PC computer training lab was moved to the basement, Hyder said.

<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  A particle accelerator operates in Earth's upper atmosphere above major thunderstorms at energies comparable to some of the most exotic environments in the universe, according to new satellite observations of terrestrial gamma-ray flashes.
</p>
<p>
  Terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (TGFs) are very short blasts of gamma rays, lasting about one millisecond, that are emitted into space from Earth's upper atmosphere.
</p>
<p>
  The gamma rays are thought to be emitted by electrons traveling at near the speed of light when they scatter off of atoms and decelerate in the upper atmosphere.
</p>
<p>
  TGFs were first discovered in 1994 by the Burst and Transient Source Experiment (BATSE) at the Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory.<br>
  BATSE could only detect TGFs in a special observing mode and was limited in its ability to count them or measure their peak energies. New observations from the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) satellite raise the maximum recorded energy of TGFs by a factor of ten and indicate that the Earth gives off about 50 TGFs every day, and possibly many more. The findings were reported in the February 18 issue of <i>Science</i> by a team of researchers from UCSC, UC Berkeley, and the University of British Columbia (UBC).<br>
</p>
<p>
  "The idea that the Earth, a fairly small and tame planet, can be an accelerator of particles to ultrarelativistic energies is fascinating to me," said David Smith, an assistant professor of physics at UCSC and first author of the paper. "The energies we see are as high as those of gamma rays emitted from black holes and neutron stars," Smith said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The exact mechanism that accelerates the electron beams to produce TGFs is still uncertain, he said, but it probably involves the build-up of electric charge at the tops of thunder clouds due to lightning discharges, resulting in a powerful electric field between the cloudtops and the ionosphere, the outer layer of Earth's atmosphere.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "Regardless of the exact mechanism, there is some enormous particle accelerator in the upper atmosphere that is accelerating electrons to these very high energies, so they emit gamma rays when they hit the sparse atoms of the upper atmosphere," Smith said. "What's exciting is that we are now getting data good enough for the theorists to really test their models."<br>
</p>
<p>
  TGFs have been correlated with lightning strikes and may be related to visible phenomena that occur in the upper atmosphere over thunderstorms, such as red sprites and blue jets. Just how these various phenomena are related is a question the RHESSI investigators plan to pursue in collaboration with other researchers around the world, Smith said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The <i>Science</i> paper presents the first analysis of RHESSI data for TGFs. RHESSI, a NASA Small Explorer spacecraft, was launched in 2002 to study x-rays and gamma-rays from solar flares. But RHESSI's detectors pick up gamma rays from a variety of sources. Smith worked with RHESSI principal investigator Robert Lin at UC Berkeley and Christopher Barrington-Leigh, now at UBC, to plan ways they could use the satellite for a range of investigations in addition to studying solar flares.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Liliana Lopez, a UC Berkeley undergraduate, has been working with Smith to analyze the RHESSI data for TGFs. The <i>Science</i> paper presents the results from a search of three months of RHESSI data, and the analysis of additional data is ongoing.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The authors estimated a global average rate of about 50 TGFs a day, but the rate could be up to 100 times higher if, as some models indicate, TGFs are emitted as narrowly focused beams that would only be detected when the satellite is directly in their path.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The duration of TGFs recorded by RHESSI ranged from 0.2 to 3.5 milliseconds. The most energetic TGF photons detected by RHESSI were in the range of 10 to 20 million electron volts (10-20 MeV), or about 300 times as energetic as medical x-rays. The electrons that emitted these gamma rays would have been traveling at 99.99 percent of the speed of light, with energies on the order of 35 MeV.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The findings raise many interesting questions, including whether the electrons that emit TGFs ultimately contribute to the high-energy electrons in Earth's radiation belts, Smith said. "This is a very interesting process involving extreme physics right here on Earth, and if we can understand the process here it might give us insights into similar processes in less accessible parts of the universe."<br>

        <title>New findings lead researchers to question basic assumptions of fisheries management</title>

<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  Biologists speaking at a symposium in Washington, D.C., last week warned that fundamental assumptions underlying current fisheries management practices may be wrong, resulting in management decisions that threaten the future supply of fish and the long-term survival of some fish populations.
</p>
<p>
  The symposium, organized by Steven Berkeley of UCSC and Larry Crowder of Duke University Marine Laboratory, was part of the 2005 Annual Meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS).
</p>
<p>
  "Much of what we now know about fish populations is not being accounted for in current fisheries management," said Berkeley, a research biologist at UCSC's Long Marine Laboratory.
</p>
<p>
  Berkeley's research on West Coast rockfish, for example, shows that large, old females are far more important than younger fish in maintaining productive fisheries. The larvae produced by these "big, old, fat females" grow faster, resist starvation better, and are much more likely to survive than the offspring of younger fish.
</p>
<p>
  Unfortunately, older fish tend to disappear under current fisheries management practices--the old fish get caught and the younger fish never have a chance to grow old.
</p>
<p>
  "Our research shows that you need to maintain older fish in the population because those are the most successful at reproducing. But normal fishing at what we now think of as safe levels will not maintain old fish in the population," Berkeley said.
</p>
<p>
  The effects of fishing on the age structure of a population is particularly striking in the various species of rockfish, which are very long-lived fish. Many rockfish can live for 50 years or more, and some species can live well over 100 years.
</p>
<p>
  Current fisheries management actually aims to reduce the number of old, slow-growing fish in the population, leaving more room and resources for younger, faster-growing fish. Most marine fish produce huge numbers of eggs and larvae, so the assumption has been that the spawners that remain after harvesting will produce plenty of larvae to replenish the population. According to Berkeley, however, elimination of older generations drastically reduces the ability of the population to replenish itself.
</p>
<p>
  Failure to account for the role of older fish in maintaining healthy populations may help explain the recent collapse of some major West Coast fisheries. The Pacific Fishery Management Council has declared several stocks of groundfish--a group that includes numerous species of rockfish and other bottom-dwelling fish--to be overfished. Tight restrictions were imposed to allow the overfished populations to recover, causing economic hardship for many in the West Coast fishing industry. Recovery of some stocks is expected to take decades.
</p>
<p>
  One way to prevent such problems may be to establish marine reserves--areas where fishing is not allowed and fish populations are able to age naturally.
</p>
<p>
  "Marine reserves are the only good way of protecting the full age structure of a population of fish, so that at least some of the population ages naturally," Berkeley said. "There may be other approaches, but no matter how you manage the fishery, you can't have a full complement of age classes unless some part of the population is off limits."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Other research presented at the symposium includes new findings about genetically distinct populations within the geographic ranges of some marine fish species, as well as evidence that successful breeders may be few and far between in some populations. These and other findings further undermine fundamental assumptions of current fisheries management, Berkeley said. "These are all things that should make us stop and think about how we manage fisheries," he said.
</p>
<p>
  In addition to Berkeley, UCSC graduate student Martha Burford also presented results from her research at the symposium.
</p>
<p>
  Berkeley and his collaborators have published recent papers on their research and its implications for fisheries management. Findings on the influence of maternal age on larval growth and survival appeared in the May 2004 issue of <i>Ecology.</i> Management implications of these and other findings were discussed in a paper in the August 2004 issue of <i>Fisheries.</i>

<p>
  Last year, UCSC Music Department lecturer William Coulter recorded a solo guitar track for a CD titled <i>Henry Mancini: Pink Guitar.</i> On February 13, the disc won a 2005 Grammy Award for "Best Pop Instrumental Album" from the National Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences.
</p>
<p>
  Released on the Solid Air Records label, the CD features a number of top acoustic fingerstyle guitarists performing a collection of tunes by Henry Mancini--the great composer/conductor/arranger who passed away in 1994. An icon of film and television music, Mancini was nominated for 72 Grammys, 18 Academy Awards, and won four Oscars for such tunes as the "Pink Panther Theme," "Moon River," "Days of Wine and Roses," and "Peter Gunn."
</p>
<p>
  "I'm excited, flattered, and honored to be on it," said Coulter by phone from a Music Department studio where he also works as the campus recording technician. "What's odd is that it was music that I don't normally play; I mostly play classical and traditional folk music, so doing a pop song was new for me. But I enjoyed the challenge."<br>
</p>
<p>
  "I never thought it would win," Coulter added. "It was up against a tribute album to Luther Vandross."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Coulter was contacted for the project by Solid Air Records, a label he had recorded for in the past. They sent him a list of Mancini songs to choose from, but it turned out that his first choice, "Moon River," was already taken. The label's producer suggested instead "Baby Elephant Walk," a tune from the 1962 Howard Hawks adventure/comedy film <i>Hatari</i> starring John Wayne.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "I had never actually heard the tune before," said Coulter. "So I got a couple of versions to listen to and came up with an arrangement that fit. I enjoyed doing it; it took maybe a week."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Coulter added that Solid Air also released a DVD and book containing the music for all the tunes on the CD, plus a five-minute mini-lesson from the artists about their particular song.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "I recorded the whole thing--both the tune and the lesson--in my backyard studio," Coulter said. I also wound up using different parts of the tune in my teaching."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Coulter began teaching on campus in 1995 after earning a master's degree from UCSC in ethnomusicology with an emphasis on traditional Irish music, language, and song. He will celebrate the release of his latest CD, <i>The Road Home,</i> at a March 19 concert to be held at the Kuumbwa Jazz Center. The event, presented by his record label, Gourd Music, will feature Coulter on guitar plus Barry Phillips (cello, tabla), Shelley Phillips (harp, winds), Lars Johannesson (flute), Neal Hellman (dulcimer), and Deby Benton Grosjean (fiddle).<br>
</p>
<p>
  Coulter's new CD includes pieces from Ireland, Brittany, Norway, Portugal, and the United States, as well as a number of original compositions, and a solo arrangement of Neil Young's "After the Gold Rush." The recording concludes with the title cut, "The Road Home," a track composed on the Irish whistle by McHenry Library reference specialist Laura McClanathan, and named by Coulter's son, Evan.<br>
</p>
<p>
  <i>The Road Home</i> and tickets to the March 19 Kuumbwa show are both available at Gourd Music: <a href="http://www.gourd.com">www.gourd.com</a> or by calling (831) 425-4939. The Grammy Award-winning CD, <i>Henry Mancini--Pink Guitar,</i> can be found at <a href="http://www.acousticmusicresource.com">www.acousticmusicresource.com</a>.<br>

        <title>Chancellor Denton: 'I want to hear your aspirations and goals'</title>

<p>
  Chancellor Denice D. Denton's first week on the job provided an early indication about the energy that she brings to the job.
</p>
<p>
  UCSC's ninth chancellor spent long hours during her first official week participating in a variety of introductory meetings with students, staff, faculty, alumni, and donors. "I want to hear your aspirations and goals, and I want to learn everything I can about your programs," she told members of the Academic Senate during one of those meetings. "UCSC is a wonderful place, and I feel very privileged and honored to be here."
</p>
<p>
  Chancellor Denton said her early impressions of the campus have been very positive, underscoring her belief that diversity and excellence are UCSC's twin strengths.
</p>
<p>
  The campus also has a "propensity for interdisciplinarity I have not encountered in other universities," she told the faculty on Wednesday. She added that the gap between the humanities and social sciences on one hand, and science and engineering on the other, is sometimes referred to as the Grand Canyon. "UC Santa Cruz can lead the way in how to build a bridge across that Grand Canyon," she said.
</p>
<p>
  In addition to capitalizing on opportunities, Denton added, the campus must also address its challenges. She cited the need for faculty and staff housing, more child care, and further promotion of a family-friendly atmosphere as critical UCSC needs. And it's imperative that the campus work "to ameliorate the impact of UCSC growth on the community," she added, in remarks at the senate meeting.
</p>
<p>
  A day earlier, Chancellor Denton traveled to Sacramento to participate in UC Day, the systemwide advocacy event at which alumni and other UC friends meet with lawmakers in the state capital. Denton received a warm welcome as the featured speaker at the annual UCSC alumni Sacramento chapter dinner that brings together area alumni, parents, and UCSC student interns from UC Center in Sacramento. Also attending were alumni Senate and Assembly fellows, as well as legislators.
</p>
<p>
  On both ends of her first week were surprise welcomes to campus. On her first day, Chancellor's Office staff greeted her with a brief reception in their McHenry Library office. Near the end of her first week, she was treated to a visit by children from the campus's Children's Center. The children not only presented the new chancellor with a bouquet of flowers and an oversized Valentine's Day card, they stayed long enough to produce artwork for Denton as she discussed everything from superheroes to science with the excited youngsters.<br>

        <title>Astronomer David Koo to speak at Science & Engineering Library on March 1</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_5454" align="alignright" width="120"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/02/koo_david.120.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-5454" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/02/koo_david.120.jpg" alt="David Koo" width="120" height="185" /></a>David Koo[/caption]
<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  <a href="http://www.ucolick.org/%7Ekoo/home.html">David Koo</a>, professor of astronomy and astrophysics, will discuss how astronomers are using telescopes to explore the history of the universe in a lecture at the Science & Engineering Library on Tuesday, March 1. Koo's talk, titled " What is our universe? How large is it? What was the universe like in the past?," will begin at 4 p.m. in the library's Current Periodicals Room. It is part of the library's <a href="http://library.ucsc.edu/science/synergy">Synergy Lecture Series</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Koo will describe an ongoing research project called the Deep Extragalactic Evolutionary Probe (DEEP), in which the giant telescopes at the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii and the Hubble Space Telescope are being used to survey more than 40,000 distant galaxies. Because it takes billions of years for light from distant galaxies to reach the Earth, scientists see these galaxies as they appeared when the universe was young.
</p>
<p>
  The DEEP project is led by UCSC astronomers in collaboration with researchers at UC Berkeley, the University of Hawaii, Johns Hopkins University, the University of Chicago, and the California Institute of Technology.
</p>
<p>
  The Synergy Lecture Series is designed to provide a platform for exchanging ideas and showcasing the exciting research in science and engineering currently in progress at UCSC.

<p>
  The Staff Forum/Brown Bag planned for Wednesday, February 23, has been postponed.
</p>
<p>
  This is due to a necessary change in Chancellor Denton's schedule, which requires her to be out of town. When a new date is set, it will be announced through <i>Currents Online</i> and the campus e-mail tree.
</p>
<p>
  Brown-bag forums are cosponsored by the Chancellor's Office and the Staff Advisory Board.

<p>
  Late contributions to the Second Harvest Food Drive have boosted UCSC's final tally to 40,206 pounds, up from the 32,723 pounds presented by campus organizers on December 17, the "official" end of the drive.
</p>
<p>
  Second Harvest Food Bank credits UCSC with three pounds worth of food for every dollar contributed. Second Harvest is a nonprofit organization providing food and basic necessities to people in need. The drive is cosponsored by the Academic Senate and the Staff Advisory Board.
</p>
<p>
  Faculty, staff, and students contributed, with many students donating dining hall meals or their dining program "flexi dollars."

        <title>Academic Senate to welcome new chancellor at February 16 meeting</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 14 Feb 2005 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>

<p>
  <i>UCSC's Academic Senate will hold its winter meeting on Wednesday, February 16, at 2:30 p.m. at the Stevenson Event Center. Alison Galloway, Academic Senate Chair, has addressed the following letter to members of the Senate outlining issues on the agenda.</i>
</p>
<p>
  Dear Colleagues,<br>
</p>
<p>
  At our winter meeting we will have a chance to welcome our new Chancellor, Denice Denton, who will provide us with her vision for the campus. A question and answer period will follow. The full agenda for the meeting can be found at: <a href="http://senate.ucsc.edu/meetings/05Feb/A05feb.htm">http://senate.ucsc.edu/meetings/05Feb/A05feb.htm</a><br>
</p>
<p>
  Also on the agenda are two annual reports and an oral presentation by the Committee on Faculty Welfare on the Ranch View Terrace housing project. The latter topic is of great interest to us all as the success of the project will determine our ability to continue building faculty and staff housing.<br>
</p>
<p>
  A University Center reception for the Chancellor will follow our meeting, which will be held in Stevenson Event Center. For those attending the Senate Meeting and Reception: Stevenson Lot 110 has been reserved. You can park there for the meeting, and then take shuttles to and from the University Center. Event shuttle service to and from Stevenson will begin at 4:45 and continue until the end of the reception at 7:30. Shuttles will pick up guests from the College Circle when the Senate meeting ends.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Finally, the Long Range Development Plan (LRDP)/Environmental Impact Report (EIR) scoping meeting, which begins the process of assessing the impact of proposed campus growth on our community and environment, will be held that evening, from 6 to 9 p.m. at the University Inn and Conference Center, 611 Ocean Street. If you want to attend, there will be a scheduled break at 7 p.m. to allow faculty from the reception to join the audience.
</p>
<p>
  Another scoping meeting will be held Friday, February 18, from 10 a.m. to noon in Bay Tree Building Conference Room D for the campus community who cannot attend the evening session. The draft LRDP is available at <a href="http://planning.ucsc.edu/lrdp/draft2005lrdp/">http://planning.ucsc.edu/lrdp/draft2005lrdp/</a>.<br>
</p>
<p>
  For disability accommodation, contact the Senate Office to receive this in an alternate format.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Sincerely,<br>
  <br>
  Alison Galloway, Chair<br>
</p>

  Diversity and excellence are great strengths of our campus, and together we will continue to seek and celebrate these two distinctions.
</p>
<p>
  Beginning immediately, I am initiating a "listening tour" of the campus and UCSC's extended community. My goals are to get to know you and to increase my understanding of our opportunities and challenges.
</p>
<p>
  Even before my official arrival, I have benefited from several illuminating briefings with Martin Chemers. We all owe him thanks for his excellent leadership over the past months, and I am particularly grateful for his assistance and welcome to me.
</p>
<p>
  I have also enjoyed meeting with Senate leadership and representative groups of faculty; my transition team that includes students, staff, and faculty; and several local elected leaders. I also was a guest at a small dinner hosted by Silicon Valley CEOs and another hosted by the Korean consul general to discuss our upcoming Pacific Rim Music Festival to be held in April-May 2005.
</p>
<p>
  As I expand my campus and community contacts to broaden my perspective, I look forward to several activities over the next few days. I will:<br>
</p>
<p>
  * Host a "media availability" for UCSC student reporters<br>
  * Commence regular meetings with the Staff Advisory Board<br>
  * Participate in the quarterly Academic Senate meeting<br>
  * Advocate for UC Santa Cruz with elected officials in Sacramento<br>
  * Address members of the Sacramento alumni chapter at their annual dinner<br>
  * Speak with UC Santa Cruz Foundation trustees and Alumni Association leaders<br>
  * Advance campus fundraising by meeting with prospective donors<br>
  * Host visiting scholars and attend campus events
</p>
<p>
  So that the wider campus community can view highlights of these activities in these first few weeks, we are creating a <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/administration/chancellor/">web site</a> on which photos and summaries will be posted regularly. I invite you to visit the site, which also includes in the left column a button with which you can contact me via e-mail. I am interested in your thoughts, and I will value your suggestions and ideas.
</p>
<p>
  In closing, I'd like to share with you a story that I also included in my first-day e-mail to our region's alumni and community leaders. Last Saturday, while out enjoying a beautiful day with my brother who was visiting from Texas, I was struck by a sign posted at a local beach. Describing the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, a section of the sign read, "The challenge is to balance recreation, education, research, and commercial uses with preservation of this national treasure."
</p>
<p>
  This statement truly reflects the key challenge that we face. I am inspired and delighted to join a community that so clearly articulates this goal. It is one that we can achieve together, as we build our shared future.<br>
  <br>

        <title>Professor testifies before Congress on treatment of asylum-seekers</title>

<p>
  Psychology professor Craig Haney made a whirlwind trip to Washington, D.C., last week to testify before Congress about a study he coauthored for the United States Commission of Religious Freedom on the detention conditions under which asylum seekers are kept in the United States.
</p>
<p>
  The report concluded that thousands of people who come to the United States seeking refuge from persecution are treated poorly. Many are held indefinitely in detention centers and forced to share quarters with inmates facing criminal prosecution. Asylum seekers also receive disparate treatment depending on their country of origin and where they arrive in the United States, according to the report.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The findings received widespread media attention, including reports in the <i>New York Times, Washington Post, Miami Herald,</i> and <i>Seattle Post-Intelligencer.</i> The Associated Press distributed a story widely, and National Public Radio broadcast a report about the bipartisan commission's findings.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Haney, who briefed the Senate Judiciary Committee and members of the House of Representatives, participated in a briefing at the National Press Club and fielded numerous media queries. An expert on the psychological effects of incarceration, Haney said he was "taken aback by the severity of conditions," according to the <i>New York Times</i> report.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Haney coauthored the section of the study on detention. The report's authors made numerous recommendations to the Department of Homeland Security, which administers the asylum system, including a proposal to create an office to address asylum-related issues.<br>

        <title>Chancellor hosted by Korean consul general</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_5437" align="alignright" width="220"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/02/dinner.05-02-14.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-5437" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/02/dinner.05-02-14.jpg" alt="Attending the dinner were, from left, Ron Suduiko, Steve Kang, Consul General Sang-ki Chung, Denice Denton, Hi Kyung Kim, and David Evan Jones Photo: Ann McCrow" width="220" height="104" /></a>Attending the dinner were, from left, Ron Suduiko, Steve Kang, Consul General Sang-ki Chung, Denice Denton, Hi Kyung Kim, and David Evan Jones Photo: Ann McCrow[/caption]
<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  Chancellor Denice D. Denton underscored her value for UCSC's international perspective at a recent dinner hosted by the Korean consul general in San Jose.
</p>
<p>
  Designed to brief the Korean media and business community about the upcoming Pacific Rim Music Festival at UCSC in April-May, the event was part of an ongoing effort to promote cultural collaborations between the campus and Korea.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "Creativity flourishes in diverse environments where there are adequate opportunities for cross-cultural exchange," Denton noted in her opening remarks at the dinner. "Fostering stronger ties with the international community and building UCSC's global perspective is one of my top priorities as incoming chancellor."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Denton added that initiatives like the Pacific Rim Music Festival and a proposed UCSC center for Pacific Rim Music and Culture are key examples of how the campus can benefit from its strategic location on the Pacific Rim next to the San Francisco Bay Area and Silicon Valley--major centers for international commerce and the arts.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The dinner was attended by a number of CEOs from the Korean press, radio, and television, as well as such business leaders as the president of the Korean American Chamber of Commerce in Silicon Valley and the president of the Korean Industry Network. UCSC was represented by Hi Kyung Kim, associate professor of music and artistic director of the Pacific Rim Music Festival; David Evan Jones, Porter College provost and professor of music; Ron Suduiko, vice chancellor of University Relations; and Steve Kang, dean of the Baskin School of Engineering.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "A new wave of musicians, composers, and artists grounded in the music and art of their own Asian cultures is invigorating and shaping what was previously considered the music of the West," Jones said in his brief address to the assembled guests. "At the same time, European and American composers are seeking influence in ever more fundamental ways from the rich and diverse cultural traditions of Asia."<br>
  <br>
  Jones, who traveled to Korea last spring to hear his own opera performed in Seoul, observed that the UCSC Music Department offers an unusually diverse curriculum with an important focus on the study of world music. He noted that Santa Cruz recently became the first UC campus to offer a doctorate in music composition with a specialty focusing on indigenous non-Western composers.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "Americans have a great deal to learn from Korean attitudes toward culture and, indeed, a great deal to learn from Korean culture itself," said Jones. "It is very important--not only for Korean Americans but for all Americans--that traditional Korean culture be prominently represented in our universities."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Engineering dean Kang additionally spoke about his personal pride as a Korean American in seeing Korean traditions being presented and celebrated on an American campus.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The 2005 Pacific Rim Festival will take place at UCSC from April 29 through May 7. It will include a new composition by artistic director Hi Kyung Kim, who is internationally known for incorporating Western classical music with traditional techniques and instruments from her native Korea.

<p>
  The work of dancer/choreographer Trisha Brown is well known for its lack of respect for the laws of physics.
</p>
<p>
  Throughout Brown's artistic career that has spanned more than three decades, her dancers have literally walked on walls and down the faces of buildings. Twisting in midair, they have climbed up and down each other in simulation of a spiral staircase. As the <i>Seattle Times</i> noted in a recent review, "entire dancers abandoned the earth for what felt like extended periods of time" during the U.S. premiere of her piece, "Present Tense."<br>
</p>
<p>
  The Trisha Brown Dance Company will perform "Present Tense" along with two other dynamic works on Wednesday, February 23, at the Henry Mello Center in Watsonville. The show begins at 8 p.m.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "Trisha Brown is quite famous for her gravity-defying choreography," noted UCSC Arts & Lectures production coordinator Moon Rinaldo. "'Present Tense' uses daring aerial choreography, which is essentially borrowed from the circus. Suspended in space, her dancers seem to come out of thin air."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Brown's company will also perform "Groove and Countermove," a mesmerizing homage to jazz, and "Geometry of Quiet," a piece lauded by the <i>Village Voice</i> for the "calm austerity" that "pervades her stunning new dance."<br>
</p>
<p>
  "In 'Groove and Countermove,' the dancers are each dressed in a solid color so that together they form a full spectrum rainbow," said Rinaldo. "As they come together and split apart, it's as though they are embodying the paths of refracted light falling over the stage."<br>
</p>
<p>
  The first woman to receive a coveted MacArthur Foundation "genius" award, Brown became one of the leaders of New York's experimental Judson Dance Theater in the 1960s--a revolutionary movement that changed modern dance forever. After forming the Trisha Brown Dance Company in 1970, she began collaborating with such artists as Robert Rauschenberg, Laurie Anderson, Nancy Graves, Fujiko Nakaya, and John Cage.<br>
</p>
<p>
  In 1987, Brown received both a <i>Dance Magazine</i> award for "25 Years of Sustained Innovations," and the Laurence Olivier Award for "Most Outstanding Achievement in Dance." Brown was inducted as an Honorary Member of the Academy of Arts and Letters in 1997.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The Trisha Brown Dance Company can be found performing regularly at the landmark opera houses of New York, Paris, and London, as well as numerous theaters throughout the world.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "Brown is really the queen of postmodern dance--she was integral to defining the American avant-guarde movement and her style has stood the test of time," said Rinaldo. "Her choreography is quintessential sixties cool--elegantly minimal and poetic in an urban sort of way."<br>

<p>
  Denice D. Denton's tenure as chancellor of UC Santa Cruz began today (February 14).
</p>
<p>
  The ninth chancellor in the campus's 40-year history, Denton issued a <a href="http://currents.ucsc.edu/04-05/02-14/message.asp">message to the campus community</a> and is hosting a number of introductory meetings. She also was treated to a <a href="http://currents.ucsc.edu/04-05/02-14/photos.asp">brief reception</a> by the staff in her office.
</p>
<p>
  During a busy first week on the job, the new chancellor will address UCSC's Academic Senate, join alumni in Sacramento for a UC-advocacy event, and launch a "listening tour" of the campus.
</p>
<p>
  Week Two will include a discussion with staff at a winter quarter forum.

        <title>Oceanographer Kenneth Bruland honored by two major scientific organizations</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 14 Feb 2005 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>5424</wp:post_id>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_5423" align="alignright" width="200"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/02/bruland_ken.200.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-5423" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/02/bruland_ken.200.jpg" alt="Ken Bruland" width="200" height="205" /></a>Ken Bruland[/caption]
<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  Kenneth Bruland, professor and chair of ocean sciences, has received two major honors this year: He was elected as a 2005 fellow of the American Geophysical Union and was chosen to receive the 2005 Clair C. Patterson Medal for Environmental Chemistry from the Geochemical Society.
</p>
<p>
  Bruland currently holds the Ida Benson Lynn Endowed Chair in Ocean Health at UCSC. He is an expert on ocean chemistry and the ways in which certain trace elements influence marine ecosystems. Much of his research has focused on the role of trace metals in the growth of phytoplankton, microscopic algae that form the base of marine food webs.
</p>
<p>
  Election as a fellow of the American Geophysical Union (AGU) recognizes scientists who have attained acknowledged eminence in one or more branches of geophysics and is one of the few honors that the group confers. The AGU limits the number of fellows elected each year to no more than a tenth of a percent of its membership. Bruland's election recognizes his lifetime achievements in the area of chemical oceanography. The award will be presented at the AGU's spring meeting in New Orleans in May.
</p>
<p>
  The Geochemical Society's Patterson Medal is awarded to individuals who have made an exceptional contribution to the field of environmental geochemistry. The medal recognizes Bruland's record of highly significant contributions to the field of trace-metal biogeochemistry. It will be presented at the Goldschmidt Conference, the premier annual meeting in geochemistry and mineralogy, in Moscow, Idaho, in May.
</p>
<p>
  Bruland and his students have pioneered the development of clean sampling and analytical methods for the determination of trace metals (and metalloids) in natural waters. His research group has also pioneered the development of analytical methods for the determination of the chemical form or speciation of metals, in particular the degree to which metals such as iron, copper, zinc, cadmium, and cobalt bind to organic compounds in seawater.
</p>
<p>
  Bruland has played a central role in studies of iron as a limiting nutrient in large portions of the Earth's oceans. He has been the chief scientist of major oceanographic research expeditions studying the role of iron as a limiting nutrient, most recently to the Bering Sea and the Peru upwelling regime. In addition to his studies of metals as limiting nutrients, Bruland has also pioneered research on toxic metals in both freshwater and coastal environments. This work includes research on the chemical speciation of selenium, arsenic, mercury, and lead.
</p>
<p>
  Bruland has authored more than 100 peer-reviewed publications, which have had a demonstrable impact on his field. He is listed among the select group of "<a href="http://isihighlycited.com">Highly Cited Scientists</a>" identified by ISI, a company that specializes in analyzing the scientific literature. ISI compiles lists of the authors whose work is most frequently cited by other researchers. ISI's <a href="http://isihighlycited.com">Highly Cited Scientists</a> represent less than one-half of one percent of all publishing researchers.
</p>
<p>
  Bruland joined the UCSC faculty in 1974. He received the Outstanding Faculty Award in 2001-02 from the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences. Bruland earned his B.A. in chemistry from Western Washington University and his Ph.D. in oceanography from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego.

        <title>President Summers' remarks offer global 'teachable moment'</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 07 Feb 2005 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  By Denice Denton<br>
</p>
<p>
  Forty leading scholars attended the National Bureau of Economic Research conference entitled "Diversifying the Science and Engineering Workforce: Women, Underrepresented Minorities and Their S&E Careers" and I was privileged to be among them. Dr. Lawrence Summers, the President of Harvard, presented a talk at this meeting entitled "Women and Minority Faculty." President Summers indicated that he was not speaking as the president of Harvard and that he hoped to be provocative. It appears that he failed in reaching the first objective, but has achieved great success in the second. As has been widely reported, President Summers stated that there is an absence of women from high-powered jobs in the sciences. There is evidence to the contrary.
</p>
<p>
  In fact, myriad women are at the top in their fields. Examples: the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine this year went to Dr. Linda Buck of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and the University of Washington; as of next month, four of the ten campuses of the University of California system will be led by women scientists.
</p>
<p>
  Many of the related articles and commentaries that have appeared in the past two weeks have focused on the wrong issues: the question of whether there are "innate differences" between men and women and the defense of academic freedom. Yes, there are biological differences between women and men, and, yes, freedom of speech and academic freedom are core values for all of us. However, what really matters here is that we must actively tap <i>all</i> the talent among our population to successfully address the major global challenges that we face.
</p>
<p>
  The key point is that the United States is facing a crisis of global economic competitiveness. It is essential that we draw on all the human capital in this country. We simply cannot afford to shut out more than half the population from the kind of work that will power California's -- and our country's -- economy and enhance our competitive edge. To this end, presidents of our most highly respected universities have a responsibility to provide leadership nationally at this critical time. And Harvard has a special responsibility to lead, because of its unique place in higher education. All of us dedicated to equal opportunity would expect no less.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, in the spirit of free intellectual exchange, I hope to shed light on the nature of the reaction by academics to President Summers at the meeting. In short, he did not present rigorous and supportable hypotheses. First, he proposed that women's unwillingness or inability to work 80-hour weeks precludes us from reaching the most prestigious positions in our society. Second, he hypothesized that the reasons for differences in ability and interest among men and women cannot be ascribed to sex-role socialization. And third, he posited that discrimination in the science and engineering workplace may not exist.
</p>
<p>
  Some of us at the meeting challenged President Summers' hypotheses on the following grounds. The notion that plum positions require an 80-hour workweek, and that many women are unwilling or unable to commit to this for a variety of reasons, is an outdated mythology that is unsubstantiated. The hypothesis that nature trumps nurture every time is supported neither by the research reported at the conference nor by many of the results that have been reported in the popular press in the last two weeks. President Summers' hypothesis, based on economic models, that discrimination in the science and engineering workplace may no longer exist is unequivocally refuted by research and by my own actual experiences and those of numerous others.
</p>
<p>
  The good news is that the international reaction to President Summers' statements represents a global "teachable moment." Individuals and organizations around the world are revisiting the issue of equal representation of women and minorities in science and engineering. Many are learning more about and <i>doing more</i> in this important arena. For example, President Summers and the Harvard faculty are developing plans to address the recruitment and retention of women faculty. I applaud the promise by President Summers to reverse the precipitous drop in offers of tenure to women in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, and wish him and my colleagues at Harvard every success in this endeavor. The whole world is watching to see how this story unfolds.
</p>

<p>
  Researchers at UCSC and their collaborators at other institutions anticipate new insights into the mysteries of high-energy astrophysics as plans for an innovative x-ray telescope progress toward final approval by NASA.
</p>
<p>
  If all goes well with a technical study approved by NASA for this year, the telescope should be orbiting Earth by the end of the decade and taking the first focused high-energy x-ray pictures of matter falling into black holes and shooting out of exploding stars.
</p>
<p>
  Named the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR), the project has just been pegged by NASA for detailed study in the competitive Small Explorer Program, which seeks out new technologies and new proposals for space missions that can be launched at low cost.
</p>
<p>
  Pending a final NASA review next year, NuSTAR will be scheduled for launch in 2009.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "This is a real explorer mission. There has never been a sharp focusing telescope in this part of the spectrum before, so there is a very broad range of exploration science that needs to be done," said Stephen Thorsett, professor and chair of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Thorsett chairs the science team of 11 co-investigators from seven institutions who have been planning the science goals for NuSTAR. Stan Woosley, also a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC, is another of the co-investigators. Supermassive black holes, gamma-ray jets, and the birth of new elements in supernovae are the three main areas of investigation planned for NuSTAR. But Thorsett said the most interesting results are likely to be the unexpected ones.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "We're almost certain to be surprised. Even in the first calibration observations, when we plan to look at local neutron stars, I expect the results will provide a thesis worth of work for a graduate student," he said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  According to Fiona Harrison, a California Institute of Technology astrophysicist and principal investigator of the NuSTAR project, an April high-altitude balloon flight in New Mexico should help to demonstrate whether the telescope's advanced sensors, invented and built at Caltech, are ready for space. The balloon test will mark the first time that focused pictures at high-energy ("hard") x-ray wavelengths will have been returned from high altitudes.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Focusing hard x-rays the way an optical telescope focuses light is technically very challenging, but well worth the effort, Thorsett said. Hard x-rays tend to penetrate the gas and dust of galaxies much better than the soft x-rays observed by existing x-ray satellites. NuSTAR will be 1,000 times more capable of finding new black holes than anything previously launched into space.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "Black holes that have large amounts of matter falling into them shine very brightly in this part of the spectrum, and the signal can get out of the cores of galaxies because hard x-rays are very penetrating. So this telescope will give us a very direct way to see and measure the growth of supermassive black holes, which we think are very common in the cores of galaxies," Thorsett said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Studying black holes is one of three basic science goals for NuSTAR. The telescope will be used to take a census of black holes at all scales, and will also measure the "accretion rate" at which matter has fallen into them over time.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Another goal is to detect and measure radiation emitted in the aftermath of stellar explosions, or supernovae. The remnants of supernovae that exploded centuries ago still emit signals that can shed new light on how elements are formed and ejected in supernovae. NuSTAR will be especially good at observing the radioactive decay of titanium to calcium, which tends to be produced in the region of a supernova where material either is ejected forever from the explosion or falls back inward to form a compact remnant of some sort. NuSTAR will provide a direct test of theories developed by Woosley and others to explain how the elements are formed.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "We can look at these newborn elements in supernova remnants and compare the observations with the predictions from computer models," Thorsett said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The third goal is to observe the highly energetic jets that stream out of certain black holes at nearly the speed of light. Coupled with observations from the Gamma-Ray Large-Area Space Telescope (GLAST), NuSTAR will provide data to help scientists explain this still-enigmatic but powerful phenomenon.<br>
</p>
<p>
  UCSC scientists are also involved in the GLAST project, which will use detectors designed and built by UCSC physicists in the Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "NuSTAR is another step in the development of a strong program in high-energy astrophysics at UCSC. Together with our partner institutions in the Bay Area and southern California, and other national and international partners, we are looking forward to a very active future for high-energy astrophysics research," Thorsett said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  In addition to UCSC and Caltech, the other participating organizations and universities in the NuSTAR project are the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (managed by Caltech for NASA), Columbia University, Stanford Linear Accelerator (SLAC), the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, Sonoma State University, and the Danish Space Research Institute. NuSTAR's spacecraft will be built by General Dynamics Spectrum Astro.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The Small Explorer Program is designed to provide frequent, low-cost access to space for physics and astronomy missions with small to midsized spacecraft. NASA has successfully launched six SMEX missions since 1992. The missions include the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager, launched in February 2002, and the Galaxy Evolution Explorer, launched in April 2003 and led by Caltech physics professor Chris Martin.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The selected proposals were among 29 SMEX and eight mission-of-opportunity proposals submitted to NASA in May 2003. They were in response to an Explorer Program Announcement of Opportunity issued in February 2003. NASA selected six proposals in November 2003 for detailed feasibility studies. Of these, NASA has now selected the International Boundary Explorer for launch in 2008 and NuSTAR for a possible launch in 2009.<br>
</p>
<p>
  NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Md., manages the Explorer Program for the Science Mission Directorate.<br>

        <title>Memory research sheds light on why older adults 'accentuate the positive'</title>

<p>
  Age-related differences appear to affect the way adults make and remember their choices in life, suggesting that older adults "accentuate the positive and eliminate the negative in their memories," according to research published in the current issue of the <i>Journal of Experimental Psychology.</i>
</p>
<p>
  Psychologists at UCSC have learned that adults of all ages tend to "fill in the gaps" when recalling decisions of the past, shedding light on the mysteries of memory distortion. But as people age, they rely more heavily on a comparison process that favors positive emotional outcomes, said lead researcher Mara Mather, an associate professor of psychology at UCSC.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "The results add a twist to our understanding of how people remember things that weren't there," said Mather, who coauthored the paper with UCSC graduate student Marisa Knight and then-undergraduate Michael McCaffrey, who graduated in 2003. "The way we remember one option is shaped by what we know of the other options, and the comparison process changes as we age."<br>
</p>
<p>
  "People are always surprised by how malleable memory is, but researchers have really only scratched the surface," added Mather.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Mather's research used studies of decision making to glean insight into how inaccurate memories are generated. The first study explored how adults make decisions when two options lack directly comparable features. For example, when deciding between rental apartments, prospective tenants compare features such as rent, square footage, and natural light. But the comparison is problematic when more is known about one option than the other--Apartment A has hardwood floors, for example, but nothing is known about the flooring in Apartment B.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "It's a problem in decision making, because people are driven to make decisions by comparing feature-by-feature," said Mather, who wanted to know how people cognitively cope with the gaps.<br>
</p>
<p>
  It turns out that adults of all ages tend to falsely fill in the gaps and then remember circumstances as being "more alignable" than they were. For instance, in the rental example, the tenant might "fill in the gap" by inferring that Apartment B had carpets and go on to recall that incorrect information later.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "People remember features that can be compared more than those that can't be aligned, and they make inferences that fill in the blanks and that contrast with the other information," she said. "Alignability helps memory but also leads to false memories."<br>
</p>
<p>
  In another experiment, Mather explored emotion's powerful impact on memory and found that older adults with high cognitive functioning use a decision-making strategy that generates more positive emotional outcomes.<br>
</p>
<p>
  These older adults tend to favor the feature-by-feature decision-making process because it guards against regret. By contrast, younger adults are more likely to employ what psychologists call the "whole option" strategy, in which they consider both the negative and positive aspects of each option before examining the next option. "Young people are trying to learn as much as they can about each option, while older people are more focused on feeling good about their choices," said Mather.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Mather found that in general, adults aged 65 to 80 tend to initially ignore negative features--and to remember them less--than younger adults. Elders also remember more positive features than negative, compared to younger adults, she said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Researchers previously have attributed most age differences to cognitive decline, said Mather. But in this study, Mather's team tested older adults for their cognitive abilities, and those with the best performance on tests of working memory and other complex tasks were most likely to use different strategies than the younger adults.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "This pattern suggests that younger and older adults' comparison processes are influenced by different goals," she said. "Even when older adults show little or no signs of cognitive decline, they make decisions differently than younger adults, in ways that should help them avoid regret."<br>

        <title>Third EIR 'scoping' meeting for LRDP planned on campus</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 07 Feb 2005 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  Due to a conflict between the winter-quarter meeting of UCSC's Academic Senate and two "scoping" meetings scheduled on February 16 concerning the EIR for the campus's updated Long Range Development Plan, project planners have added a third meeting to receive input on the scope of issues to be considered in the EIR.
</p>
<p>
  The third workshop will be held on campus on February 18. The meeting will take place from 10 a.m. to noon in Bay Tree Conference Room D, in Quarry Plaza.
</p>
<p>
  The first two meetings will still take place at the UCSC Inn and<br>
  Conference Center on February 16, beginning at 3 and again at 6 p.m. (see earlier <a href="http://currents.ucsc.edu/04-05/01-24/lrdp.asp">Currents article</a>).
</p>
<p>
  While the first meeting on February 16 is still planned between 3 and 5 p.m., the schedule and format for the 6 p.m. meeting have been changed to accommodate people who can't make the start time.
</p>
<p>
  The changes in the 6 p.m. meeting are as follows:
</p>
<p>
  * The length of the second meeting has been extended one hour; the meeting will now end at 9 p.m.
</p>
<p>
  * The public comment period will be interrupted at approximately 7:15 for 10 minutes so that introductory remarks can be repeated for late arrivals.
</p>
<p>
  The latest draft of the 2005 LRDP, meanwhile, was completed in late January. The draft long-range plan, updated since public comment was received on the document this past fall, is a physical blueprint for growth that is expected to take place on campus during the next 15 years.
</p>
<p>
  It is posted online and can be accessed via UCSC's "<a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/planning_2020">Planning through 2020</a>" web site.
</p>
<p>
  The EIR will assess the impact of the physical growth forecast in the LRDP. At the three scoping meetings, public agencies and members of the public are invited to provide oral comments on issues they would like to be addressed in the draft EIR.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  Volunteers are needed on two Saturdays in February to help preserve UCSC's natural environment.
</p>
<p>
  A native plant revegetation/planting day has been organized for February 12 at Younger Lagoon Reserve, part of the UCSC Natural Reserves system. Volunteers will be planting a variety of native species to support habitat restoration efforts and have the opportunity to learn about native plant and animal communities and their invasive competitors.
</p>
<p>
  Volunteers will meet at the Barn Theater at the main campus entrance at 10 a.m. to carpool to Younger Lagoon and should bring water and lunch. The workday will last until 2 p.m. To find out more or RSVP, e-mail <a href="mailto:mcstay@ucsc.edu">mcstay@ucsc.edu</a> or check the <a href="http://ucreserve.ucsc.edu/ucsccnr/stewday.html">Natural Reserves</a> web site.
</p>
<p>
  On February 26, a site stewardship field day in the Long Marine Lab area will include interplanting and maintenance of earlier native plantings and removing exotic invasive species.
</p>
<p>
  Volunteers should meet at the patio in front of the Center for Ocean Health at Long Marine Lab at 10 a.m. to work until 2 p.m. or arrange to take the carpool from the Upper Quarry Bookstore Plaza. To find out more or RSVP, e-mail <a href="mailto:grounds_interns@ucsc.edu">grounds_interns@ucsc.edu</a>, or check the <a href="http://ucscplant.ucsc.edu/ucscplant/Grounds/index.jsp?page=Stewardship_Program">Site Stewardship</a> web site.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Both work projects will be canceled only in case of hard rain.

<p>
  There are openings in the following Recreation Department classes. Call (831) 459-2806 to register.<br>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Astronomy Workshop with Joe Jordan</b><br>
  Tuesday, February 8, from 7 to 11 p.m., Bay Tree Conference Center, Room D, $15<br>
  In an evening of stargazing, learn everything you wanted to know about astronomy and space. The wonders of the night sky, the basics of observational astronomy, "cosmic ecology," and information on resources and equipment are covered first at an indoor lecture-discussion. Then we will hike to upper campus to view constellations, planets, galaxies, and nebulae (weather permitting). Bring binoculars (if you have them) and warm, layered clothing. Instructor Joe Jordan works for NASA/Ames and most recently has been involved in the search for planets around other stars.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Ballroom Dance</b><br>
  Saturday, February 12, 1 to 3 p.m., Multipurpose Room, East Field House, $10<br>
  Singles and couples are welcome in this fun introduction to social ballroom dancing. The class will concentrate on swing and waltz. Wear comfortable clothes and comfortable laced or buckled shoes. You can learn the basics of these dances in an hour each. No previous experience necessary. Instructor David Smith has been dancing ballroom for 16 years. He taught social ballroom classes for the UC Ballroom Dancers at UC Berkeley from 1997 to 2003 and is a new assistant professor of physics at UCSC.<br>

<p>
  Sociology professor John Brown Childs will discuss ways to honor and strengthen the celebration of Black History Month during a free lecture for the campus community at noon on Thursday, February 10, in Room D of the Bay Tree Conference Center.
</p>
<p>
  Childs will discuss intersections among African American history and Native American and Latino histories in the Americas. Those intersections offer ways to enrich Black History Month and honor connections between the populations. Childs, author of <i>Transcommunality: From the Politics of Conversion to the Ethics of Respect,</i> believes greater understanding of the commonalities among African Americans, Native Americans, and Latinos can enhance cooperation.
</p>
<p>
  Childs's talk is part of the Diversity Lecture Series, which continues with two more talks, both of which begin at noon in Room D of the Bay Tree Conference Center.
</p>
<p>
  On March 3, award-winning filmmaker Renee Tajima-Pena, a professor of community studies, will talk about her efforts to document social change and social justice issues in a lecture entitled, "Documenting Social Change, Working for Social Justice." Tajima-Pena's films include <i>Who Killed Vincent Chin?, My America (Or Honk If You Love Buddha)</i>, and the recent PBS series, <i>The New Americans</i>.
</p>
<p>
  On April 7, Catherine Ramirez, a professor of American studies, will discuss "Hidden History: Lady Zoot Suiters."
</p>
<p>
  The Diversity Lecture Series features presentations by UCSC faculty. The series is sponsored by the Equal Employment Opportunity/Affirmative Action Office. For more information, call (831) 459-5087 or send e-mail to <a href="mailto:andream@ucsc.edu">andream@ucsc.edu</a>.

        <title>Theater Arts Department establishes new student-run production company</title>

<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  The UCSC Theater Arts Department has established a new student-run production company to help ease the transition for undergraduates from academia to the professional theater world.
</p>
<p>
  Named "Barnstorm" because of its home base in the Barn Theater at the foot of the campus, it has been created as a model of a small professional theater company--completely organized and managed by students. Participants receive five units of academic credit and must put in a minimum of 150 hours each quarter working in one particular area such as an actor, director, publicist, or set designer.<br>
  <br>
  "Barnstorm allows the students to run their own theater company in the Barn," noted Danny Scheie, chair of the Theater Arts Department. "It gives the students a chance to have a legitimate avant-garde theater and run it how they want--the dream of every artist on the Lower East Side, but a financial impossibility for artists in the real world."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Now in its second quarter, Barnstorm is still a work-in-progress. During its premier quarter last fall, the company presented two productions of previously published works (<i>Revenge of the Space Pandas</i> by David Mamet and <i>Fat Men in Skirts</i> by Nicky Silver), plus three staged readings of original student work, and a variety of short-run performances that included improvisational comedy and live-action episodes of television shows.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "We teach students how to be professional practitioners," observed Mike McCann, the company's managing director and a UCSC graduate student in theater arts. "We give students an opportunity to see what life would be like in an actual company where there's an artistic director, a marketing team, a technical director, and various other positions."
</p>
<p>
  McCann said the goal during this first year is to create the framework of the company and have three productions running in repertory by spring quarter.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "We're thinking on a company level instead of just looking at one specific show," he explained. "For example, the marketing people must learn to consistently look ahead to promote future shows in repertory. And the set designers need to build in such a way that a set can be easily removed for the comedy group that will come in afterward."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Barnstorm hosts a number of workshops such as <i>24/7,</i> where students have just 24 hours to conceive, write, rehearse, and perform a seven-minute play--the event begins at 9 p.m. on a Saturday night and the plays are all performed by 9 p.m. on Sunday. It also presents weekly <i>Syndication/Vindication</i> nights, offering Santa Cruz-based soap operas such as <i>90210 in 95064</i> and <i>All My Kresge Children.</i> A revolving team of writers create the episodes, and the directors change every week. "We were turning people away by the end of last quarter," McCann noted.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Although some students have been able to take advantage of the proximity of Shakespeare Santa Cruz (SSC)--the professional theater company housed at UCSC--positions available to students have generally been limited by the very fact that SSC is a professional company. Students also must currently compete for a limited number of spots to present original productions through the Theater Arts Department.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "Barnstorm is filling a huge need," noted Leah Gardner, Barnstorm's artistic director and also a UCSC theater arts graduate student. "We have at least two or three events every week. And I would say that probably 25 out of 30 days in any month there's something going on in the Barn--whether a performance or a rehearsal of a production. There are so many students who want their voices to be heard and their art to be seen."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Gardner added that another goal of Barnstorm is to help build bridges between theater arts and other departments in the UCSC Arts Division.
</p>
<p>
  "We would like to have art students use the lobby of the Barn Theater as a gallery space, have film students show their short films, and have music students write themes for the soap operas or songs for a musical," Gardner said. "We ultimately want to make the Barn available for all students, not just those in theater arts."<br>

        <title>UCSC ranks sixth in number of Peace Corps volunteers</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 07 Feb 2005 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  UC Santa Cruz graduates are continuing to make their mark in the Peace Corps, coming in sixth among medium-sized campuses nationwide in the latest ranking for number of volunteers.
</p>
<p>
  UCSC has 52 alumni serving around the world as Peace Corps volunteers, the same number as last year. Since the Peace Corps' inception in 1961, 557 UCSC alumni have joined.
</p>
<p>
  The University of Wisconsin at Madison retained its longtime top ranking in the large colleges and universities ranking, with 123 volunteers. The University of Virginia again claimed the top spot for medium schools, with 84 volunteers, and the University of Chicago topped the small school list with 39 volunteers. Iowa's Grinnell College--with an enrollment of just over 1,500--had the distinction of having the best per-capita volunteer rate with 23 alumni currently serving.

        <title>Accreditation committee to meet with administration, faculty</title>

<p>
  A committee of eight distinguished academic administrators will visit UCSC February 2-4 in the closing phase of the Western Association of Schools and Colleges' (WASC) educational effectiveness review.
</p>
<p>
  During this visit, they will consult with administrators and faculty leadership to assess UCSC's commitment to "educational effectiveness" as defined in the WASC criteria for review and discuss several strategic issues with the campus leadership.
</p>
<p>
  Educational effectiveness within the framework of this review involves two things: whether students are successfully achieving the learning objectives of UCSC's programs and whether the institution has good processes for assessing and improving its effectiveness.
</p>
<p>
  Between Wednesday afternoon and Friday morning, there will be a series of meetings between members of the committee and groups of faculty, staff, and students who have been invited to address the particular topics that the visiting committee submitted to the campus last week.
</p>
<p>
  After the visit, the committee members, who have experience at both public and private research universities, will write a report to WASC about the visit and the campus review.
</p>
<p>
  UCSC administrators expect to see that report sometime in late March. After the report is made, the Western Association of Schools and Colleges' Commission will meet to approve the full review, taking action on UCSC's reaccreditation.
</p>

        <title>President Summers's remarks offer global 'teachable moment'</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 31 Jan 2005 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  By Denice Denton<br>
</p>
<p>
  Forty leading scholars attended the National Bureau of Economics Research conference entitled "Diversifying the Science and Engineering Workforce: Women, Underrepresented Minorities and Their S&E Careers" and I was privileged to be among them. Dr. Lawrence Summers, the President of Harvard, presented a talk at this meeting entitled "Women and Minority Faculty." President Summers indicated that he was not speaking as the president of Harvard and that he hoped to be provocative. It appears that he failed in reaching the first objective, but has achieved great success in the second. As has been widely reported, President Summers stated that there is an absence of women from high-powered jobs in the sciences. There is evidence to the contrary.
</p>
<p>
  In fact, myriad women are at the top in their fields. Examples: the Nobel Prize in Physiology and Medicine this year went to Dr. Linda Buck of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and the University of Washington; as of next month, four of the ten campuses of the University of California system will be led by women scientists.
</p>
<p>
  Many of the related articles and commentaries that have appeared in the past two weeks have focused on the wrong issues: the question of whether there are "innate differences" between men and women and the defense of academic freedom. Yes, there are biological differences between women and men, and, yes, freedom of speech and academic freedom are core values for all of us. However, what really matters here is that we must actively tap <i>all</i> the talent among our population to successfully address the major global challenges that we face.
</p>
<p>
  The key point is that the United States is facing a crisis of global economic competitiveness. It is essential that we draw on all the human capital in this country. We simply cannot afford to shut out more than half the population from the kind of work that will power California's -- and our country's -- economy and enhance our competitive edge. To this end, presidents of our most highly respected universities have a responsibility to provide leadership nationally at this critical time. And Harvard has a special responsibility to lead, because of its unique place in higher education. All of us dedicated to equal opportunity would expect no less.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, in the spirit of free intellectual exchange, I hope to shed light on the nature of the reaction by academics to President Summers at the meeting. In short, he did not present rigorous and supportable hypotheses. First, he proposed that women's unwillingness or inability to work 80-hour weeks precludes us from reaching the most prestigious positions in our society. Second, he hypothesized that the reasons for differences in ability and interest among men and women cannot be ascribed to sex-role socialization. And third, he posited that discrimination in the science and engineering workplace may not exist.
</p>
<p>
  Some of us at the meeting challenged President Summers' hypotheses on the following grounds. The notion that plum positions require an 80-hour workweek, and that many women are unwilling or unable to commit to this for a variety of reasons, is an outdated mythology that is unsubstantiated. The hypothesis that nature trumps nurture every time is supported neither by the research reported at the conference nor by many of the results that have been reported in the popular press in the last two weeks. President Summers' hypothesis, based on economic models, that discrimination in the science and engineering workplace may no longer exist is unequivocally refuted by research and by my own actual experiences and those of numerous others.
</p>
<p>
  The good news is that the international reaction to President Summers' statements represents a global "teachable moment". Individuals and organizations around the world are revisiting the issue of equal representation of women and minorities in science and engineering. Many are learning more about and <i>doing more</i> in this important arena. For example, President Summers and the Harvard faculty are developing plans to address the recruitment and retention of women faculty. I applaud the promise by President Summers to reverse the precipitous drop in offers of tenure to women in the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, and wish him and my colleagues at Harvard every success in this endeavor. The whole world is watching to see how this story unfolds.
</p>

  Economist <b>Robert Fairlie</b> was quoted in a <i>Washington Times</i> story about the digital divide, saying it appears to have fallen off the agenda of legislators. Fairlie's research was also featured on the <a href="http://www.digitaldividenetwork.org/">Digital Divide Network</a>'s web page.
</p>
<p>
  The <i>Santa Cruz</i> <i>Sentinel</i> featured front-page coverage of postdoctoral researcher <b>Phil Howard's</b> survey of consumers regarding their food purchases. Howard, of the Center for Agroecology & Sustainable Food Systems, has fielded calls from Public Citizen and others about the survey. His work will be written up in the March issue of <i>Sustainable Industries Journal,</i> and Howard will appear on KUSP's <i>Talk of the Bay</i> program on Wednesday, February 2.
</p>

<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  Amy Goodman, host of Pacifica Radio's <i><a href="http://www.democracynow.org">Democracy Now!</a></i> program, and Naomi Klein, author of <i>No Logo: Taking Aim at the Brand Bullies,</i> will each give a free public talk at UCSC in February during two separate events hosted by College Ten.
</p>
<p>
  Goodman will appear at 6 p.m. on Wednesday, February 23, when she will reflect on the life of slain <i>Los Angeles Times</i> reporter Ruben Salazar during a talk about the importance of independent, corporate-free media and the role it plays in democracy.
</p>
<p>
  Goodman began her career in community radio in 1985 and helped launch <i>Democracy Now!</i> in 1996. She is also coauthor of the best-selling book, <i>The Exception to the Rulers: Exposing Oily Politicians, War Profiteers, and the Media Who Love Them.</i>
</p>
<p>
  Her talk will take place in the Colleges Nine and Ten Multipurpose Room. During the event, Goodman will be presented with College Ten's first Ruben Salazar Journalism Award, which honors the memory of Salazar, who was killed during an anti-Vietnam War protest in East Los Angeles when he was hit in the head by a police tear gas canister.
</p>
<p>
  Klein's talk, "War & Fleece: How Economic 'Shock Therapy' Backfired in Iraq," will begin at 7 p.m. on Wednesday, February 16. Klein will discuss the Bush administration's efforts to transform Iraq into a "free-market utopia" and the forces of resistance the reforms unleashed. She will suggest specific actions activists can take to support the struggle for genuine freedom and sovereignty in Iraq.
</p>
<p>
  Klein is an award-winning journalist and the author of <i>Fences & Windows: Dispatches from the Front Lines of the Globalization Debate.</i> She writes an internationally syndicated column for the <i>Nation,</i> the <i>Guardian,</i> and the <i>Globe and Mail.</i> Klein's talk will also take place in the Colleges Nine and Ten Multipurpose Room.
</p>
<p>
  The public is invited to attend the lectures, which are free, but seating is limited. Ticket distribution for both events will begin at noon on Monday, February 7, in Social Sciences 1, Room 104; limit one ticket per person.
</p>
<p>
  Priority will be given to College Nine and College Ten students with student identification. Ticket distribution will continue until 4 p.m. that day and will take place every weekday from noon to 1:30 p.m. while supplies last. Call (831) 459-1253 for updated information on ticket availability.
</p>
<p>
  Ticket holders are advised to arrive at the events by the scheduled start time; tickets not redeemed by that time may be considered void, and open seats will be filled on a first-come, first-served basis.
</p>
<p>
  Both events will be broadcast live on campus radio station KZSC and cable television (channel 30), and Community Television of Santa Cruz County plans to simulcast Goodman's talk.
</p>
<p>
  The lectures are part of the UCSC Distinguished Visiting Professor Series and are being cosponsored by the UCSC Alumni Association and presented in association with the College Ten class <i>Social Justice Workshop.</i> For more information, call (831) 459-1253 or send e-mail to <a href="mailto:astuart@ucsc.edu">astuart@ucsc.edu.</a><br>

<p>
  Sara Solovitch, a lecturer in UCSC's science writing program, was looking forward to working with a modern-day hero when she drove to San Jose last August for her first meeting with Jumana Mikhail Hanna.
</p>
<p>
  In July 2003, the <i>Washington Post</i> had run a powerful front-page story about Hanna, an Iraqi woman who said she had endured torture and rape in an Iraqi prison in the mid-1990s.
</p>
<p>
  Her harrowing story was cited in Senate testimony by Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz, and Hanna had been granted refugee status and resettled in San Jose.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Solovitch had just signed a contract to coauthor a book with Hanna about her horrific experiences under Saddam Hussein's regime. But Hanna's story soon began to unravel as Solovitch tried to confirm the details. In a lengthy article in the January issue of <i>Esquire</i> magazine, Solovitch describes how she gradually came to the realization that Hanna had fabricated the entire story and fooled everyone from the Pentagon to the <i>Washington Post.</i><br>
</p>
<p>
  Since the publication of Solovitch's <i>Esquire</i> article, the <i>Washington Post</i> has published a report acknowledging that the original story was based on false claims, as well as an article by the <i>Post's</i> ombudsman about the newspaper's investigation of the story. In addition, Solovitch's debunking of the <i>Post</i> story has been covered by the <i>New York Times, Chicago Sun-Times, USA Today,</i> National Public Radio, and other media.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Solovitch, who lives in Santa Cruz and teaches a course on "The Science Profile" for the Science Communication Program, is a freelance magazine writer and former staff writer for the <i>Philadelphia Inquirer.</i> Her stories have appeared in <i>Esquire, Outside, Wired, Omni, Legal Affairs,</i> and other publications, and she has won numerous awards, including the 2002 Outstanding Magazine Article by the American Society of Journalists and Authors.<br>

        <title>Chemers listened to concerns of all while focusing on the university's mission</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_5388" align="alignright" width="210"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/01/chemers_portrait.05-01-31.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-5388" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/01/chemers_portrait.05-01-31.jpg" alt="Acting Chancellor Martin M.

<p>
  An expert on leadership, Acting Chancellor Martin M. Chemers says he was guided by his "commitment to the greater good" during his tenure as chief executive on campus.
</p>
<p>
  Despite more than eight years as dean of the Division of Social Sciences, Chemers said he'd never felt so keenly the pull of UCSC's numerous constituencies until he held the top job.
</p>
<p>
  "There are so many people who feel they should have influence over the campus--undergraduates and graduate students, faculty, staff, the unions, politicians, the alumni, parents, the Office of the President, donors, and friends," said Chemers.
</p>
<p>
  "Some of them understand the mission of the university very well and are committed to it, others are less knowledgeable, and some have no interest in the mission at all. And they're all pushing on the chancellor."
</p>
<p>
  Chemers took time to meet with constituents and hear their concerns, but his decisions always adhered to the university's mission of teaching, research, and public service.
</p>
<p>
  From campus neighbors concerned about traffic to undergraduates who oppose UCSC's plans in Silicon Valley, Chemers made inroads with agitated constituencies by listening. He dismissed talk of his legacy but did say he'd be pleased if his work "seeking the common good" was viewed as a model for the campus.
</p>
<p>
  "Trust is the bedrock of leadership, and trust is built on honesty," said Chemers, who was appointed campus provost/executive vice chancellor after John Simpson departed and became acting chancellor in April after M.R.C. Greenwood was named provost of the University of California. "People will accept that you don't agree with them or aren't going to do what they want if you've told them the truth."
</p>
<p>
  Leaders need to be able to articulate a vision and explain it in a way that everyone can relate to. "People want to be heard, and they want the respect that is revealed when you take the time to listen to them," said Chemers. "I told the students that Silicon Valley represents the greatest concentration of wealth and intellect in the history of the world, and we'd be crazy not to be a part of that. They understood that."
</p>
<p>
  Working many 70-hour weeks, Chemers shared his passion and commitment to higher education, and he inspired others to join the effort. The hours were demanding, but the hardest part was being criticized for things he hadn't done.
</p>
<p>
  "You get almost all bad news up here, and you have to know how to control your emotions," said Chemers, speaking from the Chancellor's Office in McHenry Library. Chemers drew upon a tenet of the Iroquois Confederacy when times got tough. "The Iroquois Confederacy had a representative form of government before we did, and one of the things they require of Confederate Lords is skin that is seven spans thick to be proof against anger and recrimination."
</p>
<p>
  Chemers also spoke of Martin Luther King Jr. and his ability to inspire individuals to overcome self-interest and work toward the greater good. "It was not in anyone's <i>individual</i> best interest to march in Selma, but he had a way of tapping their collective interest," said Chemers. "Most people who work in the university were called to a higher purpose, and sometimes we have to remind them of that. We're all public servants."<br>
</p>
<p>
  On a lighter note, Chemers credited his mother with instilling in him a respect for punctuality. "My mother always told me it was impolite to make people wait, and I've always remembered that," said Chemers, who regularly arrives early for meetings and events.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Chemers described himself as a problem solver who likes working as part of a team. The isolation of being at the top made him particularly grateful for his advisers, among them Assistant Chancellor William Hyder and Interim Campus Provost/Executive Vice Chancellor Margaret L. Delaney. "Honesty is just as important in your inner circle, and I've been very fortunate," he said.
</p>
<p>
  After the arrival of Chancellor Designate Denice D. Denton on February 14, Chemers plans to take sabbatical leave and return to campus to teach in the Psychology Department in spring 2006.<br>

<p>
  If you could use some extra help around the house, Alternative Spring Break students are hoping you'll give them a call.
</p>
<p>
  The students' annual fundraiser supports a program sending students to build a home and help with community projects in Mexico over spring break. Alternative Spring Break is an international service project run by the Service Learning Program of College Nine and College Ten.
</p>
<p>
  Students are available on weekends to work on general household tasks, such as painting, general gardening, and window washing. The person doing the hiring decides how much to donate to the Alternative Spring Break program.
</p>
<p>
  To arrange a student work crew, e-mail <a href="mailto:abecker@ucsc.edu">abecker@ucsc.edu</a> or call (831) 459-1864.

<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  The UCSC Theater Arts Department will present a special benefit performance for the tsunami relief effort in Indonesia on Saturday, February 12, from 3:30 to 5 p.m. at UCSC's Second Stage Theater.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The event will feature a dance performance by visiting Indonesian choreographers Irawati Durban and Bulan Djelantik, plus Bay Area gamelan players led by UCSC Music Department lecturer Undang Sumarna, and local dancers who have performed extensively in Indonesia.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Santa Cruz resident and Sumatran scholar Sjamsir Sjarif will also speak briefly about conditions in Aceh--Indonesia's tsunami-battered province that was one of the most devastated areas affected by the Dec. 26 disaster that killed more than 150,000 people and left thousands missing throughout southern Asia.
</p>
<p>
  "That part of Indonesia is one of the hardest places to get into because of the insurgency of the last five years," noted UCSC theater arts professor Kathy Foley, who is coordinating the benefit. "Outsiders have been banned for some time because Americans had been going in and writing negative things about the national government. So it has been a complicating factor in relief efforts."
</p>
<p>
  "Getting aid to where it needs to be dispersed is not always a straightforward path in Indonesia," Foley added. "From what I've heard from people in Jakarta, the government is doing everything it can, but the infrastructure is just not set up for the true flow of aid that we would have if it was Florida."
</p>
<p>
  Foley said that proceeds from the benefit will be directed to organizations such as the Indonesian Lions Club International, Doctors Without Borders, and World Vision.
</p>
<p>
  "Our intention is to set up a table that identifies these organizations and allow people to donate in whichever direction they desire," she said. "Because I personally know the individuals involved in each of these organizations, we know the money will definitely get there."
</p>
<p>
  The benefit was organized in conjunction with a student theatrical production that is scheduled to run on campus in February. Titled <i>The Ghostly Goddess and the Sinner Saint: How Islam Came to Java,</i> the production is directed by Foley and features choreography by the guest Indonesian artists. Performances will take place at 7 p.m. (Sundays at 3 p.m.) on Feb. 4-6 and 10-13 at the Theater Arts Second Stage.
</p>
<p>
  "People wanted to do something and we had this opportunity to utilize these guest artists who were already here choreographing and directing a dance/drama for the Theater Arts Department," Foley explained. "And because I was directing the production, I had access to the performing space. So we hope to bring together the campus, Indonesian, and Santa Cruz communities."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Durban, a senior lecturer at Indonesian College of the Arts (STSI) in Bandung, has performed internationally since 1964. A visiting artist at UCSC this winter quarter, she recently presented a seminar for the UCSC Arts Division that included an exhibit of Southeast Asian masks, which are now on display at the East-West Center on the grounds of the University of Hawaii.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "The Indonesians will be very thankful for all the Americans who helped and tried to collect money for the tsumami victims--not only in Indonesia, but in other countries as well," Durban observed. "Young children were even making cookies and selling them in malls to raise money. We are very impressed and grateful."<br>
</p>
<p>
  "It's a drop in the ocean, but it's doing something," added Djelantik, who has taught Balinese dance nationally and internationally since the 1970s. "It's helping to make the image of Americans in Muslim countries like Indonesia more popular."<br>
</p>
<p>
  <br>
  <i>The Feb. 12 benefit at 3:30 p.m. is limited to 200 people and seating will be first-come, first-served. Donations are requested. It will be followed at 7 p.m. by a performance of The Ghostly Goddess and the Sinner Saint--tickets for the evening performance are available at the UCSC Ticket Office: (831) 459-2159.</i><br>

<p>
  Stan Woosley, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC, has won this year's Bruno Rossi Prize for his pioneering work on supernovae and gamma-ray bursts, the most violent explosions in the universe. The prize is awarded each year by the High Energy Astrophysics Division of the American Astronomical Society.
</p>
<p>
  Woosley, an expert in theoretical astrophysics, is being recognized for his detailed modeling of supernovae--the massive explosions of dying stars. Woosley's work on the evolution of massive stars and their explosion as supernovae describes how the "heavy" elements needed for life, such as oxygen and iron, are forged and ejected. In addition, Woosley's "collapsar" model of massive star explosions has recently been identified as the central engine of some gamma-ray bursts, a major breakthrough in this field.
</p>
<p>
  "There's something terribly attractive about a titanic explosion, as long as it occurs far enough away," Woosley said. "To think that the same explosions that make black holes and neutron stars are also creating the elements of life still continues to amaze me. I am honored to receive the Rossi Prize for what has been such rewarding work with so many bright students and colleagues."
</p>
<p>
  The Rossi Prize is given in recognition of significant contributions as well as recent and original work in high-energy astrophysics. The prize is in honor of Bruno Rossi, an authority on cosmic-ray physics and a pioneer in the field of X-ray astronomy. The prize also includes an engraved certificate and a $1,500 award.
</p>
<p>
  Woosley was recently awarded the American Physical Society's 2005 Hans Bethe Prize, which recognizes outstanding work in the area of astrophysics, nuclear physics, and related fields. He received the Outstanding Faculty Award from the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences at UCSC in 2003-04. He was elected as a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2001 and a fellow of the American Physical Society in 1987.
</p>
<p>
  Woosley is a co-investigator on the HETE-II collaboration, a NASA mission devoted to the study of gamma-ray bursts that was launched in 2000. He is also the director of the Center for Supernova Research at UCSC. He has published more than 300 papers.
</p>

  A computer simulation of a gamma-ray burst developed by Woosley and two of his former graduate students, Andrew MacFadyen and Weiqun Zhang, can be viewed at the <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/topstory/2003/0618rosettaburst.html">NASA web site</a> (third animation).

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  Kelp forests, dolphins, coral reef fish, and a broad range of other subjects in the marine sciences are under investigation in 19 student research projects supported this year by the Friends of Long Marine Lab Student Research Awards. The awards will provide a total of $11,200 in research funding for the student projects, which were selected by a proposal review committee.
</p>
<p>
  The award recipients were recognized last week at a special ceremony and reception held at the Seymour Marine Discovery Center. In addition, the Friends of Long Marine Lab will honor the top two student research award recipients--Olivia Cheriton and Itchung Cheung, both graduate students in ocean sciences--with a special award to be presented at the annual Global Oceans Gourmet Dinner, a f20 undraising event for the Friends of LML that will take place March at the Bittersweet Bistroin Aptos. (For ticket information, call (831) 459-3694.)
</p>
<p>
  The Friends of LML provides funding for public education, marine mammal programs, and student research, as well as the development and operation of the Seymour Center. The Student Research Awards come from the interest generated by six different endowments: The Jane McHenry Student Awards Fund, the Lillian McPherson Rouse Student Award Fund, the William Baye Heald Scholarship Fund, the Friends of LML Student Support Fund, the Mark T. MacMillan Memorial Prize Fund, and the Ken Norris Marine Mammal Research Award.

        <title>Consumers eager to know more about environmental, social impacts of food they buy, survey finds</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 24 Jan 2005 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>5365</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_5364" align="alignright" width="230"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/01/bananas.05-01-24.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-5364" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/01/bananas.05-01-24.jpg" alt="UCSC researchers found that product labels and brochures or retail displays were the most popular sources of information.

<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  Here's a heads-up for farmers and food retailers: Consumers have a strong desire to know more about the origins and safety of the food they buy, and they'd like to get the information when they make their purchases.
</p>
<p>
  That's the word from UCSC researchers who surveyed consumers to find out what people want to know about their food and what factors would influence their purchasing decisions.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Food safety topped the list of consumer concerns, perhaps not surprisingly following headlines about mad cow disease and recurrent outbreaks of food contaminated with <i>E. coli</i> bacteria.
</p>
<p>
  Consumers also want to know more about the nutritional value of their food, the treatment of animals in food production, environmental impacts--including pesticides and genetic engineering--of food production, and the working conditions of people who labor in the food industry.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "Our goal was to give consumers a voice they might not have, and the first step was to find out what they want to know," said Phil Howard, a second-year postdoctoral researcher at UCSC's Center for Agroecology & Sustainable Food Systems (CASFS), who conducted the survey with postgraduate researcher Jan Perez. "Food retailers, processors, and growers should all start looking closely at these issues because people are interested in supporting them through their purchases. Broadly speaking, ethical consumerism is an emerging force, and people on the Central Coast appear eager to make more informed purchases."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Howard and Perez conducted five focus groups in 2003 and in 2004 mailed a 26-question survey to more than 1,000 randomly selected households in San Mateo, Santa Clara, Santa Cruz, San Benito, and Monterey Counties; the survey response rate was 48 percent. The survey was funded by a U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) grant to foster sustainable agriculture on the Central Coast.<br>
</p>
<p>
  From Salinas to Silicon Valley, consumers voiced a strong interest in learning more about their food. Consumers expressed interest in knowing more about the wages food workers receive, the influence of large corporations, and how far food travels before it is sold.<br>
</p>
<p>
  More than 80 percent of survey respondents endorsed the idea of food labels as a source of the information they're seeking, said Howard.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "Product labels and brochures or retail displays were the most popular sources of information," said Howard, noting that newspapers, magazines, books, and the web were selected by about half of respondents. "People really want the information when they're making their purchasing decisions."<br>
</p>
<p>
  In some parts of Europe, Howard noted, meat is packaged with bar codes and stores are outfitted with computer terminals that allow consumers to scan the product and call up profiles of the farm where the food was produced. "Europeans are more committed to the idea of ethical consumption, and regional and local labels are a lot more prevalent there," said Howard. "The fair-trade movement began in Europe and is already changing the production practices of products like coffee and bananas."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Citing the growing popularity of seals or logos that signify food meets certain standards, such as the USDA's "organic" food label, survey respondents were asked to rank five potential "eco-labels," defined as follows:<br>
</p>
<p>
  * Humane--meat, dairy products, or eggs from animals that haven't been treated cruelly<br>
</p>
<p>
  * Locally grown--grown within 50 miles of point of purchase<br>
</p>
<p>
  * Living wage--provides above-poverty wages to workers involved in producing the food<br>
</p>
<p>
  * U. S. grown--grown in the United States<br>
</p>
<p>
  * Small-scale--supports small farms or businesses<br>
</p>
<p>
  Respondents were most enthusiastic about the idea of a "humane" label, with more than 30 percent citing it as their first choice, followed by locally grown (22 percent), living wage (16.5 percent), U.S. grown (5.9 percent), and small-scale (5.2 percent). "Humane treatment of animals was a very emotional topic in the focus groups--it came up in all of them," said Howard.
</p>
<p>
  In the survey, respondents were asked to choose only one standard from different combinations, but Howard noted that most people found that "very difficult"; many respondents said they would prefer one label that represented all of the standards.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "People are interested in buying food that is fresh and that they trust because they know where it came from," said Howard. "Consumers like the idea of supporting the local economy, and they want to support family farms, which have a strong emotional appeal to a lot of people."<br>
</p>
<p>
  In a separate question, consumers showed a strong willingness to pay a "price premium" for strawberries that would guarantee a living wage and safe working conditions for farmworkers. Eighty-four percent of respondents said they were willing to pay a 5 cent--or 3 percent--price premium on a $1.50 pint of strawberries for the assurance the standards were being met. The median price premium people were willing to pay was $1.06 per pint, or 71 percent above the regular price. Given that strawberry pickers typically earn 10.5 to 12.5 cents per pint, a 5-cent-per-pint price premium could fund a 40 percent increase in piece-rate pay, said Howard.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "People being surveyed tend to express a greater willingness to pay than they actually support in the marketplace, but these results show the potential level of support for a price premium," said Howard.

<p>
  The Santa Cruz Predatory Bird Research Group at UCSC has received a $50,000 grant from Oracle Corporation to support the group's education program.
</p>
<p>
  The grant provides funding to maintain and enhance the Oracle Peregrines Outreach Program, which includes presentations to school and community groups on birds of prey and conservation of endangered species.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "The Oracle grant enables us to continue offering our presentations to school assemblies and other groups. Educating the public about protection of endangered species is an important part of our mission," said Glenn Stewart, program director with the Santa Cruz Predatory Bird Research Group (SCPBRG).<br>
</p>
<p>
  Stewart gives most of the group's outreach presentations, usually accompanied by his four-year-old tame peregrine falcon, Sophie. The education program has reached thousands of students throughout California.<br>
</p>
<p>
  To schedule presentations, schools and community groups can contact the SCPBRG at <a href="mailto:falconet@ucsc.edu">falconet@ucsc.edu</a>, or use the online form available on the <a href="http://www.scpbrg.org">SCPBRG web site.</a><br>
</p>
<p>
  "The school visits are a great way to increase students' appreciation for birds of prey and for nature in general, and to stimulate their interest in science and conservation biology," Stewart said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The Oracle grant will also help the SCPBRG with efforts to recruit and train interns, coordinate volunteers, and maintain its web site.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The SCPBRG was founded at UCSC in 1975 to restore the endangered peregrine falcon population in California, which had been decimated by the pesticide DDT. At the time, only a few nesting pairs of peregrine falcons remained in California (two pairs had been found in a 1970 survey). By 1999, however, the SCPBRG was able to celebrate the removal of the peregrine falcon from the federal endangered species list, and the group received an award from the director of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in recognition of its "pioneering efforts."<br>
</p>
<p>
  The SCPBRG now applies its expertise to a wide range of bird species and is working toward creative solutions for a variety of wildlife management challenges in the western United States.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "Oracle is excited to continue our partnership with the SCPBRG," said Rosalie Gann, director of Oracle Giving and Oracle Volunteers. "Oracle is dedicated to helping preserve and protect endangered species like the peregrine falcon and is thrilled to aid in the recovery of the falcon population by supporting SCPBRG's efforts, including the monitoring of falcons at our campus."<br>
</p>
<p>
  SCPBRG biologists have been observing peregrine falcons at Oracle's campus in Redwood City since 1999. The company has supported the group's monitoring of falcons on the Oracle campus, as well as outreach efforts to share its work with the public. In spring of 2000, a pair of falcons began using a nest box installed by SCPBRG atop one of the Oracle buildings and nested there for three successive years. A camera in the nest box enabled visitors to the SCPBRG web site to watch the falcons raising their chicks.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Stewart's talks typically include a review of the work of UCSC conservation biologists that helped bring about the recovery of the peregrine falcon population; information about current nesting of peregrine falcons at the Oracle campus and other urban sites; and discussion of the SCPBRG's current work, including satellite tracking of migrating bald eagles and ecological restoration efforts on California's Channel Islands.<br>

<p>
  The Chancellor's Office and Division of Student Affairs invite all members of the campus community to take part in a memorial on Wednesday, January 26--the one-month anniversary of the devastating tsunami that struck South Asia.
</p>
<p>
  Beginning at noon that day, students, faculty, and staff will be able to contribute messages to the memorial, which will be located in the Quarry Plaza near Bay Tree Bookstore. The informal memorial is intended to enable people to write personal messages on colorful ribbons, which will be displayed in the area. People may contribute messages to the memorial throughout the remainder of the afternoon.
</p>
<p>
  For more information on other events or about ways in which you can donate to the tsunami relief effort, please see <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/tsunami/">www.ucsc.edu/news_events/tsunami/</a>.

        <title>UCSC meetings will help define 'scope' of LRDP EIR</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 24 Jan 2005 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>5359</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  Two public meetings have been scheduled for February to provide input to UCSC on the issues to be considered in the Draft Environmental Impact Report that will be prepared for the campus's next Long Range Development Plan (LRDP).
</p>
<p>
  The EIR "scoping" meetings will both take place on February 16: between 3 and 5 p.m. and between 6 and 8 p.m. Both meetings will be held at the UCSC Inn and Conference Center at 611 Ocean Street in Santa Cruz.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The latest draft of the 2005-20 LRDP, meanwhile, is expected to be released in early February. The Draft LRDP, updated since public comment was received on the document this past fall, is a physical blueprint for growth that is expected to take place on campus during the next 15 years.
</p>
<p>
  When it is completed, it will be posted on UCSC's <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/planning_2020/">"Planning through 2020"</a> web site.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The EIR will assess the impact of the physical growth forecast in the LRDP. At the two scoping meetings, public agencies and members of the public will be invited to provide oral comments on the range of issues to be addressed in the draft EIR.<br>
</p>
<p>
  For additional information about UCSC's current planning process, please go to: <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/planning_2020/">http://www.ucsc.edu/planning_2020/</a>.<br>

<p>
  In February of 2003, David Cuthbert received a call from southern California's La Jolla Playhouse to do the lighting design for a benefit performance by comedian/actor Billy Crystal.
</p>
<p>
  The benefit was only scheduled for two evenings, so Cuthbert promptly put together a quick design and moved on with his life. Shortly thereafter, he was hired as an assistant professor of theater arts at UCSC.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Last April, the phone rang again and Cuthbert was asked to work on the same Crystal show at the same venue, but this time for a two-week run as a workshop production. Eight months later, Crystal's one-man show, now significantly enhanced and titled <i>700 Sundays,</i> opened on Broadway at the Broadhurst Theatre to tremendous acclaim--with Cuthbert on board as lighting designer.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Crystal, who hosted the Academy Awards for the eighth time in 2004, has starred in a wide variety of films including <i>When Harry Met Sally, Analyze This, City Slickers, Mr. Saturday Night, Throw Momma From the Train, The Princess Bride,</i> and <i>America's Sweethearts.</i> But <i>700 Sundays,</i> a two-act autobiographical play, was Crystal's Broadway debut. The title refers to the number of days he was able to spend with his hardworking father, who died when the comedian was just 15.
</p>
<p>
  Cuthbert recalled the first time he saw the show, an unlikely mix of stand-up comedy and deeply personal stories about the death of Crystal's parents.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "I saw it with the set designer and we sat there in stunned silence," Cuthbert recalled. "We were both really moved. I remember saying that I understood why this guy is such a big star--he's earned it."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Once Cuthbert learned that the show was going to Broadway, he had approximately one month to come up with the new lighting design.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "My first impulse was not to do much with the lights; I didn't want to distract from the show," said Cuthbert. "But Billy actually wanted me to do a lot of things--he's an actor and director; he knows what he wants. So we worked a lot on moods and shifts in emotion."<br>
</p>
<p>
  "I was a little worried going in because all of the electricians are union and have a rich tradition of being difficult," Cuthbert added. "But I ended up having a great group of people and things went really smoothly."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Cuthbert spent six weeks in New York preparing for the show, which opened on December 5, 2004. Three days later, the box office was at an $8.5 million advance, according to <i>Playbill.</i> The show is scheduled to run through March 6, and Cuthbert said there is talk of it traveling to the Ahmanson Theatre in Los Angeles. It will also be turned into a book that is slated for publication in November by Warner Books.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "This is definitely the biggest show I've ever worked on," Cuthbert noted. "More people will see this show than all my other shows combined. It will also make more money than all of my other shows combined," he added.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Cuthbert's background includes a solid track record of work on the West Coast as a lighting designer for such venues as La Jolla Playhouse, the Old Globe, Sledgehammer Theatre, San Jose Rep, A Contemporary Theatre, the Intiman, the Magic Theatre, and Shakespeare Santa Cruz. His national tours include <i>The History and Mystery of the Universe</i> (about Buckminster Fuller) and two productions with the New Pickle Circus. He has also earned six awards for design excellence, including a San Diego Critics Circle Award.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Now in his second year on the UCSC theater arts faculty, Cuthbert noted that continuing his professional career outside the university is essential for him as a professor, particularly to keep up-to-date with technology and trends in the theater. "I can't imagine trying to teach without actually doing lighting design," he observed. He added that working on a show like <i>700 Sundays</i> also helps to expand his range.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "It's not the type of show that I'm normally hired to do," he explained. "I'm known for doing new and experimental plays. So in that sense, it was a bit of a challenge to create something realistic and subtle."<br>
</p>
<p>
  "But by far it was the most supported I've ever been as an artist," Cuthbert said. "Every whim I had, I could make happen. They would go to the ends of the earth to do whatever I needed to make sure the show worked."<br>

        <title>Politics professor Paul Frymer wins awards for article on racial integration of national labor unions</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 24 Jan 2005 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>5347</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  Paul Frymer, associate professor of politics, has received three recent awards for his article "Acting When Elected Officials Won't: Federal Courts and Civil Rights Enforcement in U.S. Labor Unions, 1935-1985." The article was published in the August 2003 issue of the <i>American Political Science Review</i>.
</p>
<p>
  Frymer received the Law and Society Association's prize for the best article of 2003, as well as the American Political Science Association's Mary Parker Follett Award for the best article on politics and history. He also received the association's McGraw Hill Award for the best article in the field of public law.
</p>
<p>
  Frymer's article about the racial integration of national labor unions examined the role of courts in the production of social change. The courts, he argued, were effective at a time when elected officials failed to respond. Unable to resolve its own political disputes, Congress delegated to the courts the responsibility of enforcing civil rights laws. Judges and lawyers responded, and a series of subsequent civil rights cases compelled unions to integrate by imposing significant financial costs from damage awards and lawyers' fees. Ironically, although the percentage of African American workers increased dramatically, in many unions their overall numbers went down because the unions were so weakened by the litigation.
</p>
<p>
  Frymer, who will arrive at UCSC this fall as an associate professor and director of the Legal Studies Program, is currently a fellow at Princeton University in the Law and Public Affairs Program. Prior to this year, he was an associate professor at UC San Diego.

        <title>Chancellor Designate Denton plans to reach out to campus and beyond upon her arrival</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 17 Jan 2005 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>5346</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  Emphasizing her intent to get to know the campus and the wider UCSC community in as effective a way as possible, Chancellor Designate Denice D. Denton has asked a broadly representative campus group to recommend ways for her to maximize her time during the first weeks after her arrival.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "It is really important to me that I get to know the people of the campus and community," said Denice Denton. "I am happy to dedicate significant time to reaching out in ways that will help me quickly appreciate the aspirations of students, staff, faculty, alumni, and UCSC's many friends and partners--and I will do a lot of listening and expect to garner new ideas and strategies to enhance our campus's positive impact."<br>
</p>
<p>
  To provide this service, a transition team representing students, staff, and faculty has begun evaluating the myriad opportunities and invitations to welcome UCSC's ninth chancellor, after she takes office on February 14.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Considering Chancellor Designate Denton's priority of learning quickly about the challenges and accomplishments of campus members as well as the interests of UCSC's friends and partners, the transition team will identify major events and key issues as well as recommend a schedule of briefings and other activities.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Members of the team are:<br>
  * Jessica Pierce, Student Union Assembly president<br>
  * Kai Pommerenke, Graduate Student Association president<br>
  * Rosemary Anderson, Staff Advisory Board<br>
  * Alison Galloway, professor of anthropology and Academic Senate chair<br>
  * David Kliger, dean of Physical and Biological Sciences and chair of the Council of Deans<br>
  * Gail Hershatter, professor of history and director of the Institute for Humanities Research<br>
  * Nicole Paiement, professor of music<br>
  * Herman Gray, professor and chair of sociology<br>
  * Eugene Switkes, professor of chemistry and member of the President's Advisory Committee to Select a Chancellor<br>
  * Thomas Vani, vice chancellor of Business and Administrative Services<br>
  * Francisco Hernandez, vice chancellor of Student Affairs<br>
  * Ronald P. Suduiko, vice chancellor of University Relations<br>
  * Donna Blitzer, director of Government & Community Relations<br>
</p>
<p>
  Exofficio members of the group are Wiliam Hyder, assistant chancellor, who will serve as chair of the transition team; Elizabeth Irwin, associate vice chancellor of communications; and Judi Hance, assistant to the chancellor.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The existing Executive Budget Committee/Executive Advisory Committee and the Vice Chancellors' Operations group will also serve in a broader consultative and advisory capacity for transition planning.

        <title>Alan Richards briefs top brass at Pentagon's Central Command</title>

<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  At the invitation of high-level military intelligence officers, UCSC professor Alan Richards briefed top Pentagon officials last month about the sources of instability throughout the Middle East and beyond.
</p>
<p>
  Richards, a professor of environmental studies and a critic of Bush administration policy in the Middle East, flew to U.S. Central Command in Tampa, Florida, to deliver two briefings and meet with top brass during a whirlwind 24-hour trip.
</p>
<p>
  Headquartered at MacDill Air Force Base, Central Command (Centcom) controls U.S. combat forces in the Middle East. Centcom Commander Gen. John Abizaid reports directly to Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld.
</p>
<p>
  Richards was invited by the Commander's Advisory Group, which consists primarily of intelligence officers, to discuss "Long-term Sources of Instability in the Centcom Region," which extends from the Horn of Africa to central Asia.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "They understand what a quagmire we're in and are bringing in outsiders to articulate what they find it hard to say in the current climate," said Richards, referring to "rampant group think and the rigidity of military hierarchy."<br>
</p>
<p>
  With Abizaid in Iraq, Richards met with Deputy Commander Air Force Lt. General Lance Smith, as well as members of his staff.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "Group think is always a problem, but I told them what I thought, as best I could, in a way that I hoped they could hear," said Richards, who summed up his analysis this way: "It is not in our national interest to enrage the largest generation of young Arabs and Muslims in history, which is what we are now doing."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Two-thirds of the world's 300 million Muslims are under the age of 30, according to Richards. High unemployment, coupled with poor living conditions and corrupt leadership, has contributed to widespread despair and anger that is being inflamed by Bush administration policies, he said.
</p>
<p>
  With little to lose, a generation of young Middle Eastern men is embracing Islamic fundamentalism and its anti-American message, said Richards.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Since before the war, Richards has taken every opportunity to share his expertise with military and government officials, briefing officers at the U.S. Army War College in Pennsylvania, the U.S. Naval War College in Rhode Island, members of the intelligence community in Washington, D.C., and many others.<br>
</p>
<p>
  In Tampa, officers from several other countries attended both of Richards's briefings and asked pointed questions, he said. "The most vocal were a Pakistani, a Saudi, and a Qatari," said Richards, noting that Australians, Italians, Canadians, and Dutch also asked questions. "The Arabs were delighted and relieved that I wasn't peddling the usual neoconservative line."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Richards also dined with members of the Commander's Advisory Group and referred to the trip as "a pretty intense 24 hours."<br>
</p>
<p>
  "The problem, of course, is that when the president has it fundamentally wrong, and won't listen, what can you do?" said Richards. "Still, it seemed like something worth doing."<br>
  <br>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  Two of UCSC's most highly regarded community collaborations have received nearly $1 million from the W. K. Kellogg Foundation to support their work promoting educational achievement, economic equity, and environmental justice.<br>
</p>
<p>
  UCSC's Bridging Multiple Worlds Alliance (BMWA) and the Center for Justice, Tolerance, and Community (CJTC) will share a grant of $978,125 over three years. The Kellogg Foundation awarded the funds as part of its "engaged institutions" program. Since 1930, the nonprofit foundation has focused on "helping people help themselves," and its programs build the capacity of individuals, communities, and institutions to solve their own problems.
</p>
<p>
  Since opening in 1965, UCSC has gone beyond its purely academic mission to distinguish itself as an engaged partner with local, regional, state, nationwide, and global communities.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "Our faculty are committed to building a better world, and these two programs strengthen the capacity of community-based organizations to change social policy and educational outcomes for the underrepresented and disadvantaged," said Acting Chancellor Martin M. Chemers.
</p>
<p>
  "Communities have a great deal to gain from interacting with the university, and the university also sees important gains from these collaborations. Our researchers are generating exceptionally useful work on issues of equity, diversity, and social justice."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Both BMWA and CJTC emphasize partnerships in which community members are active participants who help shape the research agenda, a commitment that the Kellogg Foundation also embraces.<br>
</p>
<p>
  BMWA was developed by UCSC psychology professor Catherine Cooper and is codirected by Cooper and Elizabeth Dominguez, director of the Cabrillo Advancement Program at Cabrillo College. The alliance is devoted to encouraging young people from diverse backgrounds to get on the path to higher education and college-based careers by increasing their awareness of college as an option for them and of the resources that are available to them. Active in six states, the alliance reaches out to children, beginning with sixth graders, and works with families, schools, and neighborhood programs to "bridge multiple worlds" and build university/community partnerships that open the academic pipeline to youth of all backgrounds, including those of African, Chinese, Filipino, Latino, European, Japanese, Cambodian, Vietnamese, and Native American descent.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "Within the alliance, we create partnerships to help low-income, ethnic-minority, and immigrant youth create networks of support so they can build pathways to college and careers," said Cooper.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Under the leadership of Manuel Pastor and Dana Takagi, professors of Latin American and Latino studies and sociology, respectively, CJTC has built upon UCSC's reputation by building collaborative relationships between the center and community organizations working on issues of environmental degradation, regional empowerment, employment assistance programs, and local impacts of globalization, to name a few.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "The CJTC is dedicated to 'leveling the playing field' in public policy debates by giving community organizations the empirical data they need to seek social, economic, and environmental justice," said Pastor.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The Kellogg grant will support the ongoing work of BMWA and CJTC and will position each initiative as a model for university/community collaborations across the country. Programs will provide training to social justice leaders, educators, students, and policy makers to encourage collaboration with community-based organizations and the building of enduring alliances with other individuals.

        <title>Library's Regional History Project completes series on agricultural history of Santa Cruz</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 17 Jan 2005 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  The UCSC Library's Regional History Project has just published seven oral histories to complete a series focusing on the ethnic and agricultural history of Santa Cruz County.<br>
</p>
<p>
  All of the interviews were conducted in 1977 by oral historians Randall Jarrell and Meri Knaster, and were edited by Irene Reti, the current director of the Regional History Project. Reti noted that the entire series consists of 18 oral histories that have been published intermittently since the mid-1980s. A brief synopsis of each newly published volume is listed below:<br>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Jose Galvan Amaro: Mexican American Laborer, Watsonville, California, 1902-1977</b><br>
  This interview with Jose Galvan Amaro, a Mexican American fieldworker, was conducted in Spanish at his home in Watsonville. It focuses on Amaro's extensive experience as a laborer in California from the 1920s to the 1970s. It has been published both as a verbatim transcript in Spanish and in English translation.<br>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Frank Barba: Filipino Labor Contractor, Watsonville, California, 1898-1977</b><br>
  Frank Barba's narrative is a significant contribution to the history of agriculture and to the history of Filipino immigration in Santa Cruz County. Born in 1898 in San Nicolas, Ilocos Norte, on the largest of the Philippine islands, he came to Watsonville in 1927 to take over the management of a Filipino labor camp that had already been established by his aunt. He worked as a labor contractor from 1927, at first independently, and then for the Birbeck Company of Aromas, which grew lettuce, string beans, broccoli, and sugar beets. At the time of this interview in 1977, Barba was 78 years old and semiretired, supervising schoolchildren in the fields for various growers in the area.<br>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Porter Chaffee: Labor Organizer and Activist, 1900-1977</b><br>
  Porter Chaffee's oral history offers valuable primary source documentation on the labor struggles of the 1930s, particularly from the point of view of a Communist labor activist and WPA writer. He wrote for the leftist <i>New Masses</i> magazine and composed an unpublished memoir entitled "The Journal of a Hungry Man," which is on deposit together with his other papers at the Bancroft Library at UC Berkeley. Chaffee founded a branch of the Communist Party in Santa Cruz in 1929. He shares his recollections of some of the socialists in Santa Cruz County, many of whom were of German heritage. He recalls organizing a hunger march up Pacific Avenue in Santa Cruz that went past the Santa Cruz County Court House, and also describes fascist reprisals against Santa Cruz socialists.
</p>
<p>
  During the 1930s, Chaffee forged friendships with radical luminaries such as the muckraking journalist and editor Lincoln Steffens and the writer Kenneth Rexroth. He also became an organizer for the Cannery and Agricultural Workers Industrial Union, which organized several successful strikes. Chaffee's oral history is a significant contribution to the historical record on this tumultuous chapter of California labor history.<br>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Apolonia Dangzalan: Filipina Businesswoman, Watsonville, California, 1896-1992</b><br>
  This oral history provides rare primary documentation of the history of Filipino immigration in California from a female perspective. Dangzalan was born in February 1896 on the largest of the Philippine islands. In 1927, she joined her nephew in Watsonville and opened a boarding house for Filipino agricultural workers on Bridge Street, where she became known as "Mama" Dangzalan. She also opened another boarding house on Salinas Road in 1930. Dangzalan served as a labor contractor, hiring men to work in the Gary Company's fields and was one of very few women engaged in labor contracting. She also opened a liquor store, dance club, and pool hall on Main Street in Watsonville in 1936. During World War II, she owned a house of prostitution on Union Street in Watsonville. In 1950, Dangzalan went into business for herself as a farmer, primarily growing strawberries. She died in 1992, at the age of 96.<br>
  <br>
  <b>John Melendy: Santa Cruz County Farm Advisor, 1947-1976</b><br>
  Melendy served as a Santa Cruz County farm advisor with the Agricultural Extension Service for 30 years, including 10 as county director of the Agricultural Extension Service. He discusses changes in agriculture in Santa Cruz County from the 1940s through the 1970s--how rising land prices affected the types of crops grown, the effects of mechanization, farm size, pest control, and controversies over pesticide use that were only beginning to come to light at that time. A substantial portion of the interview is devoted to a detailed discussion of the rise and fall of the poultry industry in the Live Oak area.<br>
</p>
<p>
  In addition to providing a history of agriculture in Santa Cruz County, Melendy's narrative contributes to the institutional history of Agricultural Extension Service itself, particularly the position of farm advisor. While Melendy's oral history is useful for its detailed descriptions of the methods and practices of farming in the mid-20th century on the Central Coast of California, it also documents the tremendous changes that swept Santa Cruz County from 1946 to 1976 as it transitioned from a largely rural to the urban and suburban landscape that it is today.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Mary Ann Berina Radovich: Croatian Apple Farmer, Watsonville, California, 1918-1977</b><br>
  This oral history focuses on Radovich's extensive experience as an apple farmer in Watsonville from the 1930s to the 1970s. It is also a significant contribution to the ethnic history of the Croatian community in the Pajaro Valley of California. Radovich owned Berina Orchards from the 1940s through the time of this interview in 1977. Radovich discusses her family's history and emigration to the United States. She describes the early apple industry in Watsonville, and the changes that took place over the years in terms of labor, mechanization, irrigation, crop varieties, pest control, harvesting, and land use. Her detailed and reflective narration makes this oral history a singular contribution to the agricultural history of central California.<br>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Alvin Richardson: Family Farming, Watsonville, California, 1908-1977</b><br>
  Alvin C. Richardson was born on Beach Road in Watsonville in 1908. His grandfather had arrived in the Pajaro Valley in 1858, where he began the family farm on Beach Road. Richardson grew up in Watsonville and spent his entire life in the Pajaro Valley. At the time of this interview in 1977, he had lived at his farm on Buena Vista Drive since 1934. Except for a brief stint at Permanente in Moss Landing during World War II, Richardson completely devoted himself to farming and primarily raised bush berries. Richardson discusses in detail the varieties of berries grown throughout the years, the labor and capital requirements of farming, and the challenges of marketing and distribution.<br>

<p>
  For the first time, astronomers have been able to combine the deepest optical images of the universe, obtained by the Hubble Space Telescope, with equally sharp images in the near-infrared part of the spectrum using a sophisticated new laser guide star system for adaptive optics at the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii.
</p>
<p>
  The new observations, presented at the American Astronomical Society (AAS) meeting in San Diego last week, reveal unprecedented details of colliding galaxies with massive black holes at their cores, seen at a distance of around 5 billion light-years.<br>
  <br>
  Observing distant galaxies in the infrared range reveals older populations of stars than can be seen at optical wavelengths, and infrared light also penetrates clouds of interstellar dust more readily than optical light.
</p>
<p>
  The new infrared images of distant galaxies were obtained by a team of researchers from UCSC, UCLA, and the Keck Observatory.
</p>
<p>
  Jason Melbourne, a UCSC graduate student and lead author of the study, said the initial findings include some surprises and that researchers will continue to analyze the data in the weeks to come.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "This is very exciting, because we have never been able to achieve this level of spatial resolution in the infrared before," Melbourne said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  In addition to Melbourne, the research team, led by David Koo of UCSC and James Larkin of UCLA, includes Jennifer Lotz, Claire Max, and Jerry Nelson at UCSC; Shelley Wright and Matthew Barczys at UCLA; and Antonin H. Bouchez, Jason Chin, Scott Hartman, Erik Johansson, Robert Lafon, David Le Mignant, Paul J. Stomski, Douglas Summers, Marcos A. van Dam, and Peter L. Wizinowich at Keck Observatory.<br>
  <br>
  "For the first time now in these deepest images of the universe we can cover all wavelengths of light from the optical to the infrared with the same level of spatial resolution, which allows us to observe detailed substructures in distant galaxies and study their constituent stars with a precision we couldn't possibly obtain otherwise," said Koo, a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC.<br>
  <br>
  The images were obtained by Wright and the Keck AO team during testing of the laser guide star adaptive optics system on the 10-meter Keck II Telescope. They are the first science-quality images of distant galaxies obtained with the new system. This marks a major step for the Center for Adaptive Optics Treasury Survey (CATS), which will use adaptive optics to observe a large sample of faint, distant galaxies in the early universe, said UCLA's Larkin.<br>
  <br>
  "We've worked very hard for several years taking data around bright stars. But we have been very restricted in terms of the number and types of objects that we can observe. Only with the laser can we now reach the richest and most exciting targets, especially those with beautiful optical images from the Hubble Space Telescope," Larkin said.<br>
  <br>
  Adaptive optics (AO) corrects for the blurring effect of the atmosphere, which seriously degrades images seen by ground-based telescopes. An AO system precisely measures this blurring and corrects the image using a deformable mirror, applying corrections hundreds of times per second. To measure the blurring, AO requires a bright point-source of light in the telescope's field of view, which can be created artificially by using a laser to excite sodium atoms in the upper atmosphere, causing them to glow.
</p>
<p>
  Without such a laser guide star, astronomers have had to rely on bright stars ("natural guide stars"), which drastically limits where AO can be used in the sky. Furthermore, natural guide stars are too bright to allow observations of very faint, distant galaxies in the same part of the sky, Koo said.<br>
  <br>
  "The advent of the laser guide star at Keck has opened up the sky for adaptive optics observations, and we can now use Keck to focus on those fields where we already have wonderful, deep optical images from the Hubble Space Telescope," Koo said.<br>
  <br>
  Because the diameter of the Keck Telescope's mirror is four times larger than Hubble's, it can obtain images four times sharper than Hubble in the near-infrared now that the laser guide star adaptive optics system is available to overcome the blurring effects of the atmosphere.<br>
  <br>
  The images being presented at the AAS meeting were obtained in an area of the sky known as the GOODS-South field, where deep observations have already been made by Hubble, the Chandra X-ray Observatory, and other telescopes. There are six faint galaxies in the images, including two x-ray sources identified by Chandra. The x-ray emissions, combined with the disordered morphology of these objects, suggested recent merger activity, Melbourne said. Mergers can funnel large amounts of matter into the center of a galaxy, and x-ray emissions from the galactic center indicate the presence of a massive black hole that is actively consuming matter.<br>
  <br>
  "We are now fairly certain that we are seeing galaxies that have undergone recent mergers," Melbourne said. "One of these systems has a double nucleus, so you can actually see the two nuclei of the merging galaxies. The other system is highly disordered--it looks like a train wreck--and is a much stronger x-ray source."<br>
  <br>
  In addition to lighting up the galactic nucleus with x-ray emissions, mergers also tend to trigger the formation of new stars by shocking and compressing clouds of gas. So the researchers were surprised to find that the system with a double nucleus is dominated by relatively old stars and does not appear to be producing many young stars.<br>
  <br>
  "If we are right about the merger scenario, then this merger is occuring between two galaxies that had already formed most of their stars billions of years before and did not have a lot of gas left over to make new stars," Melbourne said.<br>
  <br>
  If additional study shows that such objects are common further back in time, these observations could help explain one of the puzzles of galaxy formation. According to the prevailing theory of hierarchical galaxy formation, large galaxies are built up over billions of years through mergers between smaller galaxies. Since mergers trigger star formation, it has been difficult to explain the existence of very large galaxies that lack significant populations of young stars.<br>
  <br>
  "One idea is that you can have a so-called dry merger, where two galaxies full of old stars but little gas merge without forming many new stars. What we are seeing in this object is consistent with a dry merger," Melbourne said. "Even in a dry merger, there may still be enough gas to feed the black hole, producing x-ray emissions, but not enough to yield a strong burst of star formation."<br>
  <br>
  Further observations at mid- to far-infrared wavelengths, expected later this year from the Spitzer Space Telescope, may help confirm this. The Spitzer data will provide a better indication of the dust content of the galaxy, a crucial variable in interpreting these observations, Melbourne said.<br>
  <br>
  The laser guide star adaptive optics system was funded by the W. M. Keck Foundation. The artificial laser guide star system was developed and integrated in a partnership between the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and the W. M. Keck Observatory. The laser was integrated at Keck with the help of Dee Pennington, Curtis Brown, and Pam Danforth.
</p>
<p>
  The NIRC2 near-infrared camera was developed by the California Institute of Technology, UCLA, and the Keck Observatory. The Keck Observatory is operated as a scientific partnership among Cal Tech, the University of California, and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.<br>
  <br>
  This work has been supported by the Center for Adaptive Optics, a National Science Foundation Science and Technology Center managed by UCSC.<br>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  A public lecture this month in Santa Cruz on large earthquakes will provide a scientific perspective on the recent earthquake and tsunami in South Asia.
</p>
<p>
  Susan Hough, a U.S. Geological Survey seismologist, will speak on "The Very Long Reach of Very Large Earthquakes" on Wednesday, January 26, at 7 p.m. at the University Inn and Conference Center, 611 Ocean St., in Santa Cruz. Preceding her talk, from 6:30 to 7 p.m., UCSC scientists will answer questions from the audience about recent events in South Asia. Admission is free, and doors will open at 6 p.m.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The magnitude 9.0 Sumatra earthquake on December 26, 2004, showed the tremendous "reach" of very large earthquakes. In addition to the devastating tsunami, this earthquake generated enormously powerful waves within the Earth. Recently, scientists have learned that waves from large earthquakes may disturb faults in distant regions and cause "triggered earthquakes." Might the Sumatra earthquake generate similar triggered events around the globe? Hough will discuss this possibility and other implications of her research.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Hough's talk, sponsored by the Center for the Study of Imaging and Dynamics of the Earth (CSIDE) at UCSC, is part of the Distinguished Lecture Series of the Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology and the Seismological Society of America.<br>
</p>
<p>
  A USGS seismologist since 1992, Hough is editor-in-chief of <i>Seismological Research Letters.</i> Her research interests include the nature of ground shaking produced by large earthquakes, historic earthquakes (the 1811-12 New Madrid earthquakes in particular), earthquakes and earthquake hazard in India, and remotely triggered earthquakes.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Hough has published two books on earthquake science for the nonspecialist audience: <i>Earthshaking Science: What We Know (and Don't Know) about Earthquakes,</i> and <i>Finding Fault in California: An Earthquake Tourist's Guide</i>. A third book, <i>Elastic Rebound: Past and Future Earthquakes on an Urban Planet</i> (by Susan Hough and Roger Bilham), is scheduled for publication this year. Hough has also published several feature articles in magazines such as <i>Natural History</i> and <i>American Scientist.</i><br>
</p>
<p>
  CSIDE, which is hosting Hough's lecture, is part of the Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics (IGPP) at UCSC. CSIDE integrates UCSC expertise on dynamical processes within the Earth and imaging of the manifestations of those processes. Research is directed at quantifying the complex structures and interactions of Earth systems, ranging from Earth's core to the surface environment.
</p>
<p>
  CSIDE director Susan Schwartz, a professor of Earth sciences and director of the Keck Seismology Laboratory at UCSC, will join other UCSC experts on earthquakes and tsunamis to answer questions before Hough's talk. Thorne Lay, IGPP director and professor of Earth sciences at UCSC, and research geophysicist Steven Ward are expected to join Schwartz.<br>
</p>

<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  Chancellor Designate Denice Denton found herself in the eye of an international media storm early this week after Harvard University's president made controversial comments at an academic conference about the underrepresentation of women in math and science fields.
</p>
<p>
  Denton, who was presenting at the conference on Friday, has been asked by numerous news organizations to offer her views of the comments made by Lawrence Summers.
</p>
<p>
  The Harvard president sparked an uproar when he said that innate differences between men and women might be one reason fewer women succeed in science and math careers. According to a <i>Boston Globe</i> article on the controversy, Summers also questioned how much of a role discrimination plays in the underrepresentation of female professors in science and engineering at elite universities.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "Here was this economist lecturing pompously [to] this room full of the country's most accomplished scholars on women's issues in science and engineering, and he kept saying things we had refuted in the first half of the day," Denton said in the <i>Globe</i> article.
</p>
<p>
  Denton is coming to UCSC from the University of Washington, where she is dean of the College of Engineering.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Following the <i>Boston Globe's</i> coverage of the Harvard president's comments, the incoming chancellor was also interviewed by the <i>New York Times, World News Tonight with Peter Jennings,</i> National Public Radio (NPR), the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC), and the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC).<br>

  Civil rights activist Joseph Lowery delivered a message of hope leavened with humor at the 21st annual Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Convocation on Monday, January 10.
</p>
<p>
  Responding to a standing ovation as he stepped up to the podium at the Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium, the retired minister joked to the audience, "sit down, before I take up an offering."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Rev. Dr. Lowery, who with Martin Luther King helped found the Southern Christian Leadership Conference in 1957 and led the organization for 20 years, said he considers Martin Luther King Day more of a "holy day" than a "holiday."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Describing King as a "scholar, preacher, crusader, and prophet," Lowery said King "had a fire in his belly that fire hoses couldn't wash out," a reference to the old police tactic of using fire hoses against some civil rights demonstrators in the South.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Lowery said he thinks King would join him in encouraging the nation to go beyond honoring King the man, and instead honor what he symbolized: a national commitment to freedom, truth, and justice.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "We will not let them place King into a rotunda of irrelevancy," Lowery said. "This holy day provides an opportunity to redefine this nation."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Entering the debate over values in the wake of the recent presidential election, Lowery said the nation must reject "twisted values" that place profits over people, or send "smart bombs on dumb missions."<br>
</p>
<p>
  "It's time for us to get our priorities in order," Lowery said. "How can we sponsor free and fair elections in Iraq when we can't even have them in Ohio?"<br>
</p>
<p>
  "We need a revolution of values," he said, adding that "values have to embrace love. No one is excluded."<br>
</p>
<p>
  A retired Methodist minister, Lowery was wary of the shift to government funding of faith-based initiatives. "I think that the church must stay independent and be the channel that God speaks to us without interference by the government. He who pays the fiddler is going to call the tune, one way or another. I think they're buying support."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Asked during a question-and-answer period about fear, Lowery said he relied on his faith at such times. "God gives you the strength to go on despite your fears," Lowery said. He noted that King often told him he wouldn't live to see 40, and King was assassinated at 39. "But he never let the fear that he wouldn't make 40 deter him."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Lowery used the area's redwood trees to reinforce a message promoting interdependence, noting that the trees' roots, though not deep, overlap each other, adding to the trees' strength. "When you mess with one redwood, you mess with the whole doggone forest," Lowery said. "There is no path of escape for one of us that doesn't intersect with all of us," he said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Despite his misgivings about the Iraqi war, violence at home, and the country's direction, Lowery remains optimistic overall.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "I'm satisfied that change is gonna come."<br>
</p>
<p>
  The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Convocation is cosponsored by UCSC, the City of Santa Cruz, the <i>Santa Cruz Sentinel</i>, KUSP Radio, Inner Light Ministries, and the Santa Cruz Branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, or NAACP.

<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  A remarkable new book by UCSC alumna Belle Yang taps into the hopes and fears all immigrant children must experience when they try to grab hold of the American dream.
</p>
<p>
  Drawn from Yang's own saga of coming to San Francisco from Taiwan at the age of seven, <i>Hannah Is My Name</i> tells the story of a Chinese family's new life in a brightly illustrated 32-page children's book published by Candlewick Press.
</p>
<p>
  Told entirely from the child's point of view, it's a wonderfully upbeat tale that describes the obstacles faced as the family members adapt to a new way of life and anxiously wait for their green cards to avoid deportation.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Yang herself adapted well to American academia, earning a 4.0 grade-point average in high school and accepting a Regents Scholarship to attend UCSC in the late 1970s. Although she eventually earned a B.A. in biology, her life was changed forever when she spent her junior year abroad studying in Scotland. While traveling through Spain, Yang realized that she had fallen in love with the art, architecture, museums, and galleries of Europe.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "I was always very good at art but thought it would be my hobby and not my life," said Yang. "As an immigrant, my parents had hoped for me to have a stable career in medicine. But I found my voice because I was really strong in the arts, and not necessarily as a scientist."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Upon her return to the United States, Yang finished her degree at UCSC and went on to study at the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, as well as the Institute of Traditional Chinese Painting in Beijing. She traveled throughout China and was particularly enthralled by Hunan Province and the Gobi Desert. "I think China defined my style," said Yang, "particularly the folk art which is bright and cheerful. It's fun and whimsical, whereas traditional Chinese painting is very restrictive because each brushstroke must be perfect from years of studying calligraphy."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Yang spent three years exploring art in China, but returned to her parents' home in Carmel Valley after the Tiananmen massacre in 1989. "I had seen friends in China who weren't allowed to write or paint, so when I came back, I made a vow that I'd make use of my freedom," Yang noted. But following her parents' advice, she agreed to stay with them for one year in order to decide what to do with her future.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "One night there was a power failure, so my father began telling stories," Yang recalled. "When the power came back on, I immediately wrote down the story and painted a painting to go with it. I soon asked my father for more stories about his childhood. So I began to write more down and make more paintings."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Yang would eventually send some of these vignettes with paintings to a friend she had met in Beijing, who happened to be the wife of the ambassador to China. Eventually her work ended up in the hands of Amy Tan, the acclaimed author of <i>The Joy Luck Club.</i> "She wrote me a really nice letter and said she could help me when I was ready to be published," Yang said. "Two years later, I finished my collection of stories and paintings and sent it to her. She gave it to her agent, and he sent it to Harcourt Brace."<br>
</p>
<p>
  The result was Yang's first book, <i>Baba: A Return to China Upon My Father's Shoulders,</i> published in 1994 and widely reviewed in major newspapers across the country. <i>The Los Angeles Times</i> called the book "captivating...rich in humanity...lavishly illustrated and lovingly narrated... evoking the sights, sounds and motions of a lost childhood."
</p>
<p>
  Yang followed up with another book in 1996, <i>The Odyssey of a Manchurian,</i> the story of her father's flight from civil war as a young man in China. And she recently finished the third book of this trilogy that has yet to be published--a story of old China through the eyes of her great-grandfather.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Recalling her days as a student at UCSC, Yang had high praise for a class she took from UCSC professor Dilip Basu titled <i>Modern Chinese History</i>--crediting it as "a life-altering course because it made me realize how deeply rooted I was in Chinese culture." She also noted that her first book was used in a freshman core course at Porter College and turned into a play by UCSC theater arts professor Kathy Foley. Called <i>The Flight of the Monkey King,</i> the play was performed on campus in 1994.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Over the years, Yang has experienced more than her share of trials--she was seriously stalked for five years by an ex-boyfriend and later suffered from an inexplicable immune disorder that sent her to bed for nearly four years. But today Yang is healthy again, working on new projects and doing publicity for her new children's book. She recently spoke with representatives from the Los Angeles Unified School District about including the book in their bilingual program.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "My philosophy is that whenever I'm uncomfortable, I say to myself--'don't resent it, pay attention, there's a story here,'" Yang noted. "Negative experiences have always made me pick myself up again and push harder."<br>
</p>
<p>
  "It's nice to be older," Yang added. "I feel happy to be 44 and alive. I only want more time to write and paint."<br>
  <br>

<p>
  The Department of Earth Sciences invites the campus community to a discussion of the recent earthquake and tsunami in South Asia on Wednesday, January 12, at 12:30 in Room 152, Baskin Engineering Building.
</p>
<p>
  The event, titled "The Sumatran Tsunami: Cause, Effects, and Potential for Local Tsunami," will feature research geophysicist Steven Ward, an expert on tsunamis, and seismologists Thorne Lay and Susan Schwartz, both professors of Earth sciences with expertise on the causes and consequences of large earthquakes.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The South Asia disaster began with a magnitude 9.0 earthquake beneath the sea near Sumatra, triggering a tsunami that swept through the Indian Ocean and devastated coastal areas in a dozen countries. Ward has created a computer simulation showing how the tsunami waves spread out from the site of the earthquake. His expertise on the subject of tsunamis has led to numerous media interviews and appearances on local and national television programs, including <i>Dateline NBC.</i><br>
</p>
<p>
  Lay, director of the Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics at UCSC, is an expert on earthquake seismology and the internal structure of the Earth. He has worked on the development of rapid analysis capabilities that allow fault geometries and rupture attributes to be determined very rapidly after an earthquake.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Schwartz, director of UCSC's Keck Seismology Laboratory and the Center for the Study of Imaging and the Dynamics of the Earth, is an expert on the use of regional seismic network data to learn about earthquake movements. Her research interests include the processes that generate earthquakes at subduction margins and the use of arrays of sensitive instruments to study seismogenic zones.<br>

        <title>Student Regent hopefuls invited to orientations, workshops</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 10 Jan 2005 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  The Career Center has some advice for anyone hoping to become the first student Regent from UCSC: Don't delay.
</p>
<p>
  "When students wait until the last minute, there are little details that get missed--and those details can make a big difference," said Cyndi Edinger, campus Student Regent recruitment coordinator for the Career Center and a '94 Stevenson alumna. Edinger encourages interested students to check out the Career Center web site, <a href="http://careercenter.ucsc.edu">careercenter.ucsc.edu</a>, or <a href="mailto:cyndi@ucsc.edu">e-mail</a> her for more information<br>
</p>
<p>
  To help with the process, Student Regent orientations have been set for 10 to 11:30 a.m. on Wednesday, January 12, and Tuesday, February 1, at Bay Tree Conference Room C.
</p>
<p>
  Student Regent application review workshops, in which students bring their drafts for writing instructors to give comment, will be held from 3 to 4:30 p.m. on Friday, January 21, and from 11 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. on Monday, February 7, at Bay Tree Conference Room A.
</p>
<p>
  Edinger is one of many on campus hoping this will be the year that a UCSC student is selected to sit on the UC Board of Regents. The first Student Regent was chosen in 1975, but no students from UCSC have served.
</p>
<p>
  "This is an outstanding opportunity for our students to participate in crucial decisions affecting UCSC and the whole UC system," said Acting Chancellor Martin M. Chemers. "I know our campus has many students who could serve with distinction, and I encourage them to apply and take advantage of the orientations and workshops at the Career Center."
</p>
<p>
  Edinger hopes that many members of the campus community will get involved in this year's effort. Some writing instructors have already offered to help, but any additional assistance in writing or willingness to serve as a resource is welcome. "Responding to the application's essay questions can be daunting," she said.
</p>
<p>
  Students will get the chance to learn firsthand about the position from current Student Regent Jodi Anderson and designate Adam Rosenthal when they visit campus at 3 p.m. on Thursday, January 27, at the College Nine/College Ten Namaste Lounge. Refreshments will be served.
</p>
<p>
  The Student Regent is a full voting member of the UC Board of Regents, attending all meetings of the board and its committees. The Student Regent serves a one-year term after serving one year as a Student Regent-designate. The person selected this academic year for the post would begin serving as a Regent-designate in July.
</p>
<p>
  Applicants must be students who will still be registered at a UC institution when they take office, and also must be in good academic standing. The successful student candidate will have expenses covered and all tuition and fees--including parking--waived while serving two years as Regent-designate and Regent.
</p>
<p>
  Regents' duties include overseeing the financial management of the university, its investment, and its property holdings as well as appointing the president of the University of California, the 10 campus chancellors, and the directors of the major Department of Energy research laboratories.
</p>
<p>
  Applications for Student Regent are winnowed down by the UC Northern and Southern Regional Commissions, made up of undergraduate and graduate student body presidents from each UC campus, and the UC Student Association, made up of at least one voting student representative from each UC campus. Three finalists are then selected, and a committee of the Board of Regents makes the final choice.
</p>
<p>
  Student Regent applications are due to the Chancellor's Office on February 24.
</p>
<p>
  <i>Applications and additional information are available <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/careers/jobs/regent.html">online</a>.</i>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_5315" align="alignright" width="220"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/01/perlino_bldg.05-01-10.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-5315" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/01/perlino_bldg.05-01-10.jpg" alt="Federico and Rena Perlino were "very, very frugal," said friend and financial consultant John R.

<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  For more than 30 years, Federico and Rena Perlino operated a chicken-processing plant on Front Street in Santa Cruz. They lived modestly and worked hard, raising vegetables in their backyard and rarely dining out.
</p>
<p>
  "If you'd met them, you'd never have thought they had any money," said family friend and financial consultant John R. Biondi, who recently distributed more than $4.2 million from the estate to local charities and organizations after the Perlinos passed away.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The University of California is among the beneficiaries of the Perlinos' estate, which allocated nearly $420,000 to the university.
</p>
<p>
  The funds will support UCSC graduate students in psychology who are working with deaf or hearing-impaired individuals.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The Perlinos, who had no children of their own, wanted their money to be used locally and also gave generously to the Doran Resource Center for the Blind, Cabrillo College, Goodwill, the Cultural Council of Santa Cruz County, and other organizations, said Biondi.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Federico was born in Italy and immigrated to the United States as a teenager. Rena, who was born locally, married Federico at the age of 16; she never learned to drive. "They raised chickens in their backyard until they bought the property on Front Street," said Biondi.<br>
</p>
<p>
  In the 1960s, anticipating their retirement, the Perlinos asked Biondi to invest and manage their life savings of $25,000. At the height of the stock market, their nest egg peaked at a value of $5.3 million, said Biondi.
</p>
<p>
  Federico died in the 1980s, and Rena passed away in 2003.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "To start with a small amount and grow it to millions--it's everyone's dream come true," said Biondi, who grew up in the Perlinos' neighborhood and remembers everyone calling Rena Perlino "the chicken lady" for her work in the poultry-processing shop.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "When I was a kid, we'd go duck hunting twice a week in Los Banos, and we'd take our ducks down to the Perlinos' shop for plucking," recalled Biondi. "We paid five cents apiece. We'd drop them off on Sunday, and if we were lucky, we'd have more for her when we went to pick them up on Wednesday."<br>
</p>
<p>
  "They were very, very frugal. I think they went back to the old country once," said Biondi, who retired from Smith Barney in 1996 and whose son, Richard, continued to manage the money until Rena's death. "Rena would have a big birthday party every year--that was her big extravagance. She'd invite all her lady friends--I was the only man who was ever there--and we'd play bocci ball in the backyard. She'd serve champagne--the same inexpensive kind she gave me every Christmas. They were not extravagant people."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Although planned giving is becoming more popular today, individuals typically notify the benefiting institutions of their intentions. "Getting a call and hearing that someone we've never met has left the university $400,000 is remarkable," said John Leopold, director of development for the Social Sciences Division at UCSC. "The Perlinos will never know how many lives their extraordinary generosity will touch."

<p>
  Charles Gary Love, a longtime staff member and UCSC alumnus, died in his Santa Cruz home on Christmas day after a courageous struggle to overcome non-Hodgkins lymphoma. He was 60.
</p>
<p>
  Gary worked in custodial services at UCSC for most of the past 23 years, most recently for Long Marine Lab's Seymour Marine Discovery Center, where his wit and enthusiasm, along with his willingness to go above and beyond what he was paid to do, made him an integral part of the Seymour "team." His illness forced him to take a leave from the job and led to his retirement two months ago.
</p>
<p>
  Gary's association with UCSC began in 1965, when he enrolled as a member of the founding junior-year class. He graduated two years later with a bachelor's in philosophy. A lover of languages and literature, Gary studied German, French, Spanish, Russian, Latin, and ancient Greek. In fact, reading German philosophy inspired Gary to switch his major from German literature to philosophy.
</p>
<p>
  Gary's survivors include his wife, Mary Wells, also a longtime UCSC staff member.
</p>
<p>
  In lieu of flowers, the family suggests donations be made in Gary's name to the Seymour Marine Discovery Center or the Classics Program at UCSC. Checks should be payable to UC Santa Cruz Foundation/Seymour Marine Discover Center or UC Santa Cruz Foundation/Classics Program and mailed to: UC Santa Cruz Foundation, Carriage House, 1156 High Street, Santa Cruz, 95064.

        <title>Eight UCSC professors to participate in Jan. 13 public forum on the Bush presidency</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 10 Jan 2005 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>

        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  UCSC's Center for Cultural Studies will present a public forum on the Bush presidency, neoconservatism, and opposition on Thursday, January 13, at 7 p.m. in Classroom Unit 2.
</p>
<p>
  Featuring presentations by eight faculty plus town hall-style audience participation, the event will focus on the consequences of the last presidential election, as well as the current political atmosphere in the country.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "It's a response to the widespread feeling that there have been important changes in politics as a result of the election," noted associate professor of literature Christopher Connery, codirector of the Center for Cultural Studies and moderator of the forum. "We want to take stock of these changes and of what we can do as citizens and as members of the university and community."<br>
</p>
<p>
  The forum is designed to stimulate analysis and fresh thinking about such issues as the nature of political power, the new political role of evangelical Christianity, the meaning of the term "values," culture wars, the contestation over the Hispanic vote, the mounting assault on women's rights, the accelerated push toward privatization, the anti-gay/lesbian mobilization, and the political character of popular culture and the media.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "The main thing we're hoping for is broad student, faculty, and community participation," said Connery. "Things are at stake in a way that they haven't been in years. The future of Social Security, for example, will have enormous consequences."<br>
</p>
<p>
  "We also wanted to have an event that wasn't just preaching to the converted," Connery added. " We'd like to come up with new analysis and new thinking. In Santa Cruz, the political spectrum is not wide; there is a lot of agreement. The will of the community is strong but it's not clear what we all can do."<br>
</p>
<p>
  The event will explore new elements in the political arena brought about by the rise of neoconservatism, such as the recent push by the party in power to teach Creationism in the schools and to brand dissenting academics as unpatriotic.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "Discussion that universities are not to be trusted, that their independence and communications should be monitored, and that they should be defunded, says something about the attitude of this administration," said Connery. "Cuts to the National Science Foundation which funds science research--mostly at universities--are of great concern to many in our community."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Connery noted that when neoconservatives look to "problem areas" where liberalism runs deep, they tend to look at universities, popular culture, and the entertainment industry. But a key distinction is that universities are dependent on federal and state support.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "People in universities have a sense of unease about what may be coming," said Connery. "If America's commitment to public education falters, it could silence areas of dissent and criticism."<br>
</p>
<p>
  "We all recognize that slogans, repetition of familiar truths, and affirmations of our political virtues will not be enough," he added. "We need serious discussion about mobilization and politics, and new thinking. I think our campus and town have a lot to offer to national politics, and we hope this event can help inspire them."<br>
</p>
<p>
  The eight professors at the forum will give short presentations, followed by a panel discussion and audience participation. The speakers will include:<br>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Angela Davis</b>, professor of history of consciousness and one of the country's foremost activist-intellectuals. Trained as a philosopher, she has written on African American culture, politics, feminism, and music. Her latest book is <i>Are Prisons Obsolete?</i><br>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Susan Harding,</b> professor of anthropology. She has done extensive fieldwork on evangelical Christianity. Her research, long referenced by a range of authors working in the field, culminated in the 2000 publication of <i>The Book of Jerry Falwell: Fundamentalist Language and Politics.</i><br>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Ronnie Lipschutz,</b> professor of politics. He is the author of many books on environmental and ethnic politics, and on political conflict. He also writes a weekly newspaper column on national politics.<br>
</p>
<p>
  <b>George Lipsitz,</b> professor of American studies. He is an activist and scholar who has written on popular culture, oppositional cultural movements, race, and urban culture. In 1998 he published <i>The Possessive Investment in Whiteness: How White People Profit from Identity Politics.</i><br>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Robert Meister,</b> professor of politics. He is a prominent political theorist. Since the 1990 publication of the groundbreaking <i>Political Identity: Thinking Through Marx,</i> he has written and spoken widely on human rights, victimization, and on the U.S. global posture since September 11.<br>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Helene Moglen,</b> professor of literature. In addition to authoring many publications on English and American Literatures, she has for many years been a feminist activist and organizer. Currently, she is director of UCSC's Institute for Advanced Feminist Research.<br>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Manuel Pastor,</b> professor of Latina/o and Latin American studies. He is a community activist and a scholar of political economy and community. He recently published <i>Regions that Work: How Cities and Suburbs Can Grow Together.</i><br>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Alan Richards,</b> professor of environmental studies. He has published widely on environmental politics and economics, with particular expertise in the Middle East. Recently, he has been invited by the U.S. Army to share with its officers his dissenting views on the U.S. role in the region.<br>

        <title>Wellness Center offers help with efforts to lose weight, get fit</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 10 Jan 2005 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>5307</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  If the crowds at the Wellness Center are any indication, more than a few members of the campus community have resolved that 2005 will be their year to get in shape.
</p>
<p>
  Fortunately, the Wellness Center is ready to help, whether with a new "Adopt a Slug" exercise program, a walking club, seminars on exercising at home and beginning a fitness routine, and a wealth of online resources.
</p>
<p>
  On January 18, the Wellness Center will begin the "Adopt-A-Fellow Slug Exercise Mentorship Program."
</p>
<p>
  Under the program, regular exercisers will be asked to adopt their nonexercising coworkers or friends on campus and help them establish a regular physical activity routine. If your buddy completes 20 physical activity sessions (minimum 30-minutes each) within eight weeks, both you and your buddy will receive a t-shirt and be entered into a drawing for a new mountain bike. As an added incentive, each buddy will gain free access to the East Field House facilities during the program.
</p>
<p>
  To sign up, <a href="mailto:randrews@ucsc.edu">e-mail</a> Ryan Andrews with your department mailing address to receive an enrollment packet. Those wanting to be adopted as a buddy, or wanting to serve as a mentor should also contact Andrews to be matched with a partner.
</p>
<p>
  Participants are urged to sign up soon so your buddies have more time to complete the program. The last day to begin the mentorship program is February 1.
</p>
<p>
  This program is being sponsored by OPERS, Staff Human Resources, Academic Human Resources, Environmental Health & Safety, Counseling & Psychological Services, and the Odwalla company.
</p>
<p>
  In addition to the exercise buddy program OPERS is holding two seminars on exercise-related topics.
</p>
<p>
  "New Year's Resolutions: Beginning an Exercise Program," is designed for those who may have tried unsuccessfully at various times to begin a fitness program. Seminar topics will include components of a safe fitness routine, strategies for staying consistent, exercise options for those with little free time, and tips for success. The free seminar will be from noon to 1 p.m. on Friday, January 21, in Bay Tree Conference Room D.
</p>
<p>
  "Home/Office Exercise for Busy People," will provide information and demonstrate a quick full-body workout that can be done anywhere. Using your own body weight and simple elastic tubing, the workout will help participants increase strength and flexibility while barely breaking a sweat. The session will be from noon to 1 p.m. on Tuesday, March 8, in Bay Tree Conference Room D. The $15 cost includes an exercise tube and a door anchor.
</p>
<p>
  To sign up for either seminar, <a href="mailto:randrews@ucsc.edu">e-mail</a> or call Andrews at: (831) 459-3970.
</p>
<p>
  Another exercise option gaining popularity is the campus walking club. "Anybody can join and all they have to do is call or <a href="mailto:camori@ucsc.edu">e-mail</a> me and I will put them on the list," said Cindy Mori, an OPERS recreation program instructor who may also be reached by calling (831) 459-5781. "We have about 50 members to date and I'd like it to double by spring. The club is free and there is no catch--it is up to you."
</p>
<p>
  Two walks are done on the west side of campus and two on the east side. Information on times and locations is <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/opers/Wellness/facultyandstaff.html">online.</a> <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/opers/wellness/facultyandstaff.html"></a>
</p>
<p>
  "Our goal is to get as many new and old members walking or doing something as often as they can," Mori said. "Start slow and just go!"
</p>
<p>
  OPERS also has other options for becoming more fit, including:
</p>
<p>
  <b>Pilates class.</b> This smooth, flowing exercise routine is designed to increase core strength, energy and flexibility as well as improve posture. The four-week mat class, aimed at beginner and intermediate students, will be held on Mondays from noon to 1 p.m., Feb. 7-March 7, at the OPERS Activities Room. The cost is $20 with a Wellness Card, or $40 without. ]To sign up, <a href="mailto:randrews@ucsc.edu">e-mail</a> or call Ryan Andrews.

        <title>Counseling and Psychological Services gets provisional accreditation</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 10 Jan 2005 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>5303</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  Counseling and Psychological Services (CPS) has received provisional accreditation from the Virginia-based International Association of Counseling Services, Inc. (IACS).
</p>
<p>
  Provisional accreditation precedes full accreditation, which is expected by June 2007, according to Max Camarillo, director of CPS, which provides services at the Cowell Student Health Center, the colleges, and Family Student Housing.
</p>
<p>
  "We began preparing for this more than two years ago and are very gratified by the outcome," said Camarillo. "Accreditation is the seal of approval that our services meet high professional standards as a comprehensive university counseling service, and we look forward to receiving full accreditation."
</p>
<p>
  IACS accreditation is available for university and college counseling centers and public and private counseling agencies in the United States and internationally.
</p>
<p>
  To become accredited, a counseling service must meet established standards and be evaluated by an outside board. The process involves an onsite evaluation. Accredited programs are reevaluated every four years, with a mandatory onsite evaluation every eight years. Annual written reports must be submitted during the intervening years.

  Bruce McPherson and his wife, Mary McPherson, are pictured here with the Ansel Adams photo presented to them on behalf of the campus by Acting Chancellor Martin M. Chemers. A plaque on the photo recognizes McPherson's consistent support of higher education issues during his service as a California Assembly Member and State Senator. He left the latter position in December under term limit rules. The presentation was made on December 15 at a reception honoring McPherson.

        <title>Botany journal dedicates 2004 volume to biologist Jean Langenheim</title>

<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  The California Botanical Society has honored Jean Langenheim, professor emerita of ecology and evolutionary biology, by dedicating to her the latest volume of its journal, <i>Madrono</i>. This volume includes the four issues of the journal published in 2004, the most recent of which includes an essay on Langenheim's contributions to the field by botanist Thomas Hofstra.
</p>
<p>
  "[Langenheim's] enthusiasm for study of plants, including fossils, has enabled her to pursue a diversity of courses of research, to exert leadership in emerging fields, such as tropical and chemical ecology, and to influence the careers of many students," Hofstra wrote.
</p>
<p>
  He also noted that Langenheim, who came to UCSC in 1966, was the campus's first female faculty member in the natural sciences and the first woman to be promoted to full professor on this campus. Although formally retired since 1993, she has remained active as a research professor and continues to supervise graduate students.
</p>
<p>
  Langenheim has been studying plant resins and amber (fossilized resin) for more than 40 years. In 2003, she published a major book on the subject, <i>Plant Resins: Chemistry, Evolution, Ecology, and Ethnobotany</i> (see <a href="http://currents.ucsc.edu/02-03/05-26/langenheim.html"><i>Currents</i> story</a>). The book received the 2004 Klinger Book Award from the Society for Economic Botany.

        <title>Literature professor receives citation from Modern Language Association of America</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 10 Jan 2005 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  Literature professor Susan Gillman received an honorable mention from the Modern Language Association of America (MLA) for her book <i>Blood Talk: American Race Melodrama and the Culture of the Occult.</i> She was awarded the certificate in the competition for the third annual William Sanders Scarborough Prize, given for outstanding scholarly study of black American literature or culture. The MLA, the largest and one of the oldest American learned societies in the humanities, promotes the advancement of literary and linguistic studies.
</p>
<p>
  Gillman's book explores the place of race melodrama in a range of literary forms and cultural trends during the period from the end of Reconstruction to World War I. Her MLA citation notes, "This sophisticated and imaginative study interprets 'race literature' produced in the late-nineteenth century United States against the backdrop of a period of crisis and transformation in global race relations...<i>Blood Talk</i> is certain to transform radically the ways in which we understand constructions of race in United States literature at the turn of the century."
</p>
<p>
  Gillman joined the UCSC faculty in 1986. Her articles have appeared in such journals as <i>PMLA, American Literary History</i>, and <i>Critical Inquiry</i>. She is the author of <i>Dark Twins: Imposture and Identity in Mark Twain's America</i> and coeditor of <i>Mark Twain's Pudd'nhead Wilson: Race, Conflict and Culture</i>. Her current projects include "W. E. B. DuBois and the Gender of the Color Line," coedited with Alys Weinbaum, and "Past Imperfect/Future Perfect: Grammars of Adaptation in the Americas."

<p>
  In 2001, history professor Dana Frank was asked by the U.S. Labor Education in the Americas Project (US/LEAP), a Chicago nonprofit, to develop a union label for the U.S. banana market.
</p>
<p>
  The Frank signed on as a consultant and traveled to Central America to attend union workshops and regional conferences. She stayed with women banana workers in Honduras and went on road trips to Guatemala and Nicaragua to observe workshops designed for younger members of the union. Frank had meals with the workers and visited their packing plants and union offices.
</p>
<p>
  As she conducted her research in Latin America, Frank fortuitously discovered a powerful, sophisticated, and highly successful network of women's banana worker activism that is largely unknown to the rest of the world. The result is <i>Bananeras: Women Transforming the Banana Unions of Latin America</i> (South End Press, 2005), a new book that traces the growth of this vital transnational labor movement.
</p>
<p>
  "It's an amazing story and I just happened into it," said Frank, an expert on U.S. and international labor issues. "I didn't go down there intending to write about it--I just went down to work with the banana unions, and I was stunned by all of the women's projects. My book is about the history and development of these projects for gender equity and power in the banana unions, and how these women were able to build them and win the support of the men."
</p>
<p>
  There are now 40,000 unionized banana workers in Latin America, the majority of whom work for Chiquita in Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Panama, and Colombia. Frank found that since the 1990s, the unions have formed two large national federations that hold regional conferences on important issues--such as how to negotiate contracts or navigate the Central American Free Trade Agreement. The unions also provide statistical and qualitative analyses of the situtation of female workers.
</p>
<p>
  "The unions date from the late 1950s and were traditionally about two-thirds men and one-third women," said Frank. "Women were always a minority in the unions, but now they are in leadership roles--they've really changed the whole picture. People have these stereotypes of Latin American women as passive victims, but women banana workers are now having sophisticated conversations about gender roles that rival any discussion by students of feminist studies at UCSC."
</p>
<p>
  Frank noted that the women's projects are always cast as making the unions more democratic and powerful, which is why the men support them. As she writes in the book's introduction:
</p>
<p>
  "The banana workers of Latin America offer a new model that explicitly integrates gender equity as part and parcel of any effective labor internationalism. They refuse to separate the global struggle against transnational corporations from the struggle at home for women's equality and respect...They inspire us to envision a new labor internationalism that places women's issues at the center of global class politics."
</p>
<p>
  Frank received the 1999 Book of the Year award from the International Labor History Association for her previous book <i>Buy American: The Untold Story of Economic Nationalism</i> (Beacon Press, 1999). She is also the author of the books <i>Purchasing Power</i>, and coauthor--with Robin D. G. Kelley and Howard Zinn--of <i>Three Strikes</i>. Her writing has appeared in a number of newspapers and periodicals including the <i>Washington Post</i> and <i>The Nation</i>. Frank was presented with an Excellence in Teaching Award in 2001 by UCSC's Academic Senate Committee on Teaching.

        <title>UCSC geophysicist creates computer simulation of Indian Ocean tsunami</title>
        <pubDate>Tue, 04 Jan 2005 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>5298</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  Soon after hearing news reports of the tsunami that devastated coastal regions throughout the Indian Ocean, research geophysicist Steven Ward, an expert on tsunami hazards, went to work on his computer.
</p>
<p>
  Using sophisticated computational techniques to simulate the tsunami, Ward created an animated movie showing the tsunami waves spreading out through the Indian Ocean from the site of the powerful earthquake that triggered them.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The <a href="http://www.es.ucsc.edu/%7Eward/indo.mov">simulation</a>, based on the physics of earthquakes and tsunamis, is preliminary because geologists have not yet fully characterized the earthquake, Ward said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "The tsunami model depends on earthquake parameters, so as we learn more about the earthquake I will be able to refine it. But the essence of the phenomenon is captured in the animation," he said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  A magnitude 9.0 earthquake, the most powerful earthquake recorded in more than 40 years, struck underwater off the Indonesian island of Sumatra on December 26. The resulting tsunami caused devastation throughout South Asia, with the death toll now estimated at 150,000.<br>
</p>
<p>
  According to Ward, the speed of a tsunami depends on the depth of the water, with waves traveling as fast as 400 miles per hour in the deep ocean.
</p>
<p>
  When they come ashore, they are typically moving at about 30 miles per hour, he said, adding that tsunami waves are very different from the waves one usually sees at the beach.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "It's like the ocean turns into a river and starts to flow onto the land. It's not a big crashing wave like in the Hollywood movies," Ward said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Tsunamis can be generated not only by earthquakes, but also by undersea landslides and asteroid impacts. Ward has used computer simulations to study all of these potential hazards. In 2003, for example, he and asteroid expert Erik Asphaug, an associate professor of Earth sciences, published a paper describing the tsunami that could result from an asteroid that is on course for a close encounter with Earth in the year 2880 (see <a href="http://currents.ucsc.edu/02-03/06-02/tsunami.html">Currents story</a>).<br>
</p>
<p>
  In the aftermath of the disaster in South Asia, he has been contacted by numerous media outlets, including the <i>Washington Post, New York Daily News, Newsweek</i> magazine, and local KION TV.<br>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  Professor David Orr, the chair of environmental studies at<br>
  Oberlin College and a leading figure in the campus sustainability movement, will be the keynote speaker at UCSC's annual <a href="http://www.ucscsec.org/blueprint_and_summit/summit05invite.html">Campus Earth Summit</a> on January 27.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Sponsored by the Student Environmental Center, the summit will be held from 8:30 a.m. to 1 p.m., followed by an organic lunch, at the College Nine/College Ten Multipurpose Room. Participants may <a href="http://bas.ucsc.edu:16080/events/">RSVP online.</a><br>
</p>
<p>
  The newly established Chancellor's Sustainability Council will be introduced at the summit, which will also include a brief opening address by Acting Chancellor Martin M. Chemers.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The Chancellor's Sustainability Council is designed to create a campuswide focus on sustainability by providing channels of dialogue, collaboration, and action among the chancellor, senior administrators, students, staff, faculty, and members of the local community.<br>
</p>
<p>
  UCSC's first Earth Summit was held in 2002. The summits have served as a forum for students, staff, faculty, administration, and the larger Santa Cruz community to collaborate and discuss tangible ways to incorporate sustainability into every aspect of campus life. Such efforts are intended to encourage the university to reach environmentally responsible benchmarks in specific topic areas.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Each of these areas is a breakout group within the summit, and participants will choose their group based on their own passions. Groups will brainstorm priorities and form ongoing working groups to create action plans to be implemented on a continuous basis throughout the year. Their work will be documented as an update to the Blueprint for a Sustainable Campus, the entire UCSC community's vision that contains information on history, best practices, goals, indicators, and priorities with regards to specific sustainability topic areas.<br>

        <title>Femtosecond laser technique opens new opportunities for research on nerve regeneration</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 03 Jan 2005 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_5295" align="alignright" width="220"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/01/nerve.05-01-03.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-5295" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/01/nerve.05-01-03.jpg" alt="This nerve axon was cut using femtosecond laser nanosurgery.

<p>
  In a breakthrough for research on nerve regeneration, a team of UCSC and Stanford scientists has reported using femtosecond laser pulses to precisely cut individual axons of nerves in the roundworm <i>Caenorhabditis elegans,</i> one of the most versatile and widely used experimental organisms for genetic and biomedical research.
</p>
<p>
  The nerves severed by this precision technique regrew within 24 hours, often with complete recovery of function.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The project was a collaboration between applied physics researchers at Stanford University led by Adela Ben-Yakar and biologists at UCSC led by Yishi Jin and Andrew Chisholm.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The team's findings give researchers an experimental system in which they will be able to investigate in great detail the genetic and molecular factors that control whether or not damaged nerves can regrow, said Chisholm, an associate professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "This technique will enable us to find the genes that are important in allowing an axon to regenerate. In the worm, we can do systematic screening of large numbers of genes, and of drugs and other small molecules as well, to ask how they affect the process of regeneration," Chisholm said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The researchers reported their findings in a paper published in the December 16 issue of the journal <i>Nature.</i> The first author of the paper is Mehmet Fatih Yanik, a Stanford graduate student in applied physics, who worked with Ben-Yakar in her femtosecond laser nanosurgery project.
</p>
<p>
  Ben-Yakar initiated the project two years ago at Stanford and is continuing it as an assistant professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Texas at Austin. The other coauthors include Jin, a professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology at UCSC and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator; Hulusi Cinar, a postdoctoral researcher in Jin's lab; and Hediye Nese Cinar, a postdoc in Chisholm's lab.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The Cinars met Yanik through personal connections and initially discussed possible collaboration about a year ago. Yanik later told them about the femtosecond laser and how other researchers had begun using it in biological systems to surgically destroy extremely tiny structures.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "When Yanik described to me what this instrument can do, I immediately thought of my work on the nervous system of <i>C. elegans</i> and came up with a nerve regeneration experiment we could do together, and I designed the experiments," said Hulusi Cinar.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Yanik performed the nanosurgery procedure at Stanford. The technique uses extremely short pulses of intense laser light to focus energy in a very small volume. When properly focused, the energy delivered by the laser pulses breaks down chemical bonds at the targeted site, vaporizing the tissue within a tiny volume without causing side effects such as heating of surrounding tissue, Yanik said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The duration of the laser pulses used in the study was 200 femtoseconds (a femtosecond is a millionth of a billionth of a second), and the pulses were delivered at a rate of one thousand per second. The delicate axons severed by the procedure, with no apparent damage to surrounding tissue, were on average just 0.3 microns, or 300 nanometers, in diameter (a nanometer is one billionth of a meter).<br>
</p>
<p>
  "I am very excited about the merging of this new technology into biological research. I didn't know anything about femtosecond laser technology until the physicists explained it to me," said Jin, who has spent years investigating the development of the worm's nervous system. "Now there is a lot to do--it has opened up the potential to address questions that we have never been able to address before."<br>
</p>
<p>
  In their experiments, the researchers cut a nerve that runs from one side of the worm's body to the other. The nerve inhibits contraction of muscles on one side of the body while the muscles on the other side are contracting. It functions during the alternating contractions of muscles on either side of the body that enable the worm to wiggle backward with a smooth wavelike motion. Hulusi Cinar and Jin have been studying so-called "shrinker" mutants that lack this ability due to a genetic defect.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "A normal worm, when you touch its head, will move backward in a smooth motion. In the shrinker mutants, the muscles on both sides contract simultaneously, so they don't move back," Cinar said. "So these neurons were a good target for surgery because we knew that when they are knocked out you get a well-defined behavioral effect, and it's straightforward to see if their function has been recovered through regeneration."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Nese Cinar designed a movement assay to evaluate the behavioral effects in the worms and evaluated the worms in the experiments in a "blinded" manner, not knowing which ones had received the surgery.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "Without such functional assays, any anatomically observed regeneration could be explained in various ways, such as bleaching and recovery of the marker protein used to label the neurons," she said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The nanosurgery, performed on anesthetized juvenile worms, could be completed in about 10 minutes per worm once the equipment was set up.

  Although regeneration of peripheral nerves is nothing new, Chisholm said he was still surprised by the rapid recovery of function in the worms.
</p>
<p>
  Most of the severed axons regrew within 12 to 24 hours after the laser surgery. Preliminary observations indicated that after an axon is cut, the nerve cell sprouts a new axon from the severed end that regrows to reach the target muscle. In some cases, however, it appears that the two severed ends reattach, Chisholm said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "Clearly there is a lot more biology going on here that we need to explore. This just opens up a lot of exciting things to study," he said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  <i>C. elegans,</i> an almost microscopic nematode or roundworm, has become an extremely important system for biomedical research. Geneticists have identified thousands of genes in the worm that have counterparts in humans. A relatively simple organism with a short generation time, reproducing in just three days, it is easy to study in the laboratory. It has many of the same basic physiological and anatomical features, such as muscles and nerves, found in more complex animals. And it is even transparent, making it easy to see things like nerves inside its body. The researchers who pioneered the use of <i>C. elegans</i> for biomedical research received the 2002 Nobel Prize for physiology and medicine.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Now this excellent model system for biomedical research is available for studying nerve regeneration. One of the fundamental questions researchers want to answer is why nerve damage in the central nervous system--the brain and spinal cord--is usually permanent.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "In humans, peripheral nerves will regrow, but in the central nervous system the regrowth of axons is inhibited by the local environment. That's why spinal cord injuries are so serious. We want to find out why a severed axon will regrow in some situations and not in others," Chisholm said.<br>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_5292" align="alignright" width="120"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/01/love_gary.120.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-5292" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/01/love_gary.120.jpg" alt="Gary Love" width="120" height="162" /></a>Gary Love[/caption]

<p>
  Charles Gary Love, a longtime staff member and UCSC alumnus, died in his Santa Cruz home on Christmas day after a courageous struggle to overcome non-Hodgkins lymphoma. He was 60.
</p>
<p>
  Gary worked in custodial services at UCSC for most of the past 23 years, most recently for Long Marine Lab's Seymour Marine Discovery Center, where his wit and enthusiasm, along with his willingness to go above and beyond what he was paid to do, made him an integral part of the Seymour "team." His illness forced him to take a leave from the job and led to his retirement two months ago.
</p>
<p>
  Gary's association with UCSC began in 1965, when he enrolled as a member of the founding junior-year class. He graduated two years later with a bachelor's in philosophy. A lover of languages and literature, Gary studied German, French, Spanish, Russian, Latin, and ancient Greek. In fact, reading German philosophy inspired Gary to switch his major from German literature to philosophy.
</p>
<p>
  Gary's survivors include his wife, Mary Wells, also a longtime UCSC staff member.
</p>
<p>
  A memorial service and celebration of Gary's life is planned for Saturday, January 8, at 4 p.m. at the Seymour Center.
</p>
<p>
  In lieu of flowers, the family suggests donations be made in Gary's name to the Seymour Marine Discovery Center or the Classics Program at UCSC. Checks should be payable to UC Santa Cruz Foundation/Seymour Marine Discover Center or UC Santa Cruz Foundation/Classics Program and mailed to: UC Santa Cruz Foundation, Carriage House, 1156 High Street, Santa Cruz, 95064.

        <title>UCSC moves closer to fundraising goals with $1.4 million gift</title>

<p>
  UCSC has received a $1.4 million gift--the largest single donation ever given by an alum--from Foundation trustee Kit Mura-smith.
</p>
<p>
  Mura-smith has designated an irrevocable charitable trust to be equally split between enhancing the university's library facilities ($700,000) and providing scholarships for re-entry students ($700,000).
</p>
<p>
  Mura-smith credits her time studying at UCSC as an important milestone in her life because the campus accepted her as an "older" re-entry student in 1974, paving the way for her future success.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The gift brings UCSC closer to its Cornerstone Campaign goal of raising $50 million by June of 2005.
</p>
<p>
  The campus has raised $45 million to date and hopes to bring in $5 million of the grand total specifically for student scholarships, fellowships, and research grants. Prior to this donation, more than $3 million had already been raised for student support, including $1.5 million generated from two highly successful Scholarships Benefit Dinners.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "This extraordinary gift will eventually have a huge impact on UCSC students," said Acting Chancellor Martin M. Chemers, "as it will ensure state-of-the-art library facilities and provide significant support for re-entry students with scholarships and child care."<br>
</p>
<p>
  "This is an exemplary act of leadership by a UCSC Foundation trustee who is also an alumna, underscoring the philanthropic maturity of UCSC's founding cohort of students," Chemers added.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Mura-smith graduated from UCSC in 1975 with a degree in applied social anthropology. Three years later, while attending law school and working for Hewlett-Packard, she and three partners purchased technology from her employer to found their own company in Sunnyvale called Trimble Navigation.
</p>
<p>
  The firm became a leader in Global Positioning Systems (GPS) technology, with applications in fields as diverse as marine navigation, land survey, mobile communication, aerospace, geographic information systems, and personal navigation.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Now retired, Mura-smith held executive positions in marketing, product development and manufacturing operations at the company, in addition to heading the original marine business. She also became the co-owner of three patents, including a battery-powered GPS navigation wristwear device.
</p>
<p>
  Mura-smith is married to artist and former rock musician John Ware, and they now reside in Denver.

<p>
  The Friends of the UCSC Library and the Friends of the Santa Cruz Public Libraries will present a lecture by renowned author Jonathan Franzen on Thursday, January 13, from 7 to 8:30 p.m. at the Main Branch of the Santa Cruz Public Library (224 Church Street). Admission is free.
</p>
<p>
  Franzen won the National Book Award for <i>The Corrections,</i> perhaps the most-written-about novel of 2001. He is also the author of two other works of fiction--<i>The Twenty-Seventh City</i> (1988) and <i>Strong Motion</i> (1992), as well as a collection of essays titled <i>How to Be Alone</i> (2002) that includes an account of his brief tenure as an author for Oprah Winfrey's book club.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Franzen's honors include the American Academy's Berlin Prize in 2000 and a Whiting Writers' Award in 1988. He was also named one of "Twenty Writers for the 21st Century" by <i>The New Yorker</i> and one of the "Best Young American Novelists" by <i>Granta</i>. Franzen will speak about contemporary fiction writing in his talk, entitled "What Makes You Think You're Not the Evil One Himself?"<br>
</p>
<p>
  The UCSC and Santa Cruz library support groups have been sponsoring a joint author/artist series for the past decade. Previous guest speakers have included Janet Fitch, author of <i>White Oleander,</i> Santa Cruz mystery writer Laurie R. King, and William Rubel, local food expert and publisher of the children's magazine <i>Stone Soup.</i><br>
</p>
<p>
  "We find the speakers and produce posters, and they provide the community room at the Main Branch downtown and refreshments," explained Liz Sandoval, staff liaison for Friends of the UCSC Library.
</p>
<p>
  "This collaboration allows us to bring our program into the community in a convenient downtown location."<br>
</p>
<p>
  "Our Friends programming budget has always necessarily supported programs just for children and young adults," added Pat Sandidge, managing director of Friends of the Santa Cruz Public Libraries. "We are very grateful for the collaboration with the UCSC Friends because it has allowed us to expand program support to include very successful, entertaining, and stimulating adult programming."<br>
</p>
<p>
  The two groups usually present two free lectures at the downtown library during the winter months. Book artists Peter and Donna Thomas will speak about fine printing and the literary book as a work of art on Thursday, February 17, at 7 p.m. Their lecture is billed as "The Artist Book: Four Dimensional Art."<br>
</p>
<p>
  "We are thrilled to have such an internationally recognized, award-winning author as Jonathan Franzen participate," Sandoval noted. "He has personal connections in Santa Cruz and has generously agreed to take time to speak for our Friends groups this year."<br>
</p>
<p>

        <title>$200,000 gift to UCSC establishes graduate fellowship in marine mammals</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 03 Jan 2005 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_5286" align="alignright" width="200"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/01/sooys.05-01-03.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-5286" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/01/sooys.05-01-03.jpg" alt="Steve and Rebecca Sooy Photo: Sandor Nagyszalanczy" width="200" height="208" /></a>Steve and Rebecca Sooy Photo: Sandor Nagyszalanczy[/caption]
<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  A gift of $200,000 from Rebecca and Steve Sooy of Foster City has established an endowed fellowship fund to support graduate students studying marine mammals at UCSC.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The Sooys have been volunteer docents at Ano Nuevo State Reserve for many years, where they became fascinated by the northern elephant seals that breed there. The Rebecca and Steve Sooy Graduate Fellowship in Marine Mammals celebrates and continues their long commitment to the understanding and conservation of the northern elephant seal by encouraging and supporting marine mammal research.
</p>
<p>
  The fellowship will be open to any graduate student studying marine mammals at UCSC, with primary consideration given to students investigating the northern elephant seal.<br>
</p>
<p>
  UCSC is one of the top centers for marine mammal research in the world. The campus has a unique combination of field and laboratory facilities for marine mammal research, including animal holding facilities at Long Marine Laboratory and ready access to natural populations of elephant seals, harbor seals, California sea lions, and Steller sea lions at UC's Ano Nuevo Reserve. In addition, UCSC is located on the shores of Monterey Bay, a biologically rich marine environment with one of the highest diversities of marine mammals in the world, including many different species of whales, dolphins, and porpoises.<br>
</p>
<p>
  UCSC has probably the most active and productive graduate program in marine mammal biology of any university in the world, according to Daniel Costa, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology. Graduates of this program have gone on to prominent positions in academia, federal and state government agencies, and nongovernmental organizations.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "The quality of our graduate students is legendary, as our students have consistently won top honors at the Biennial Conference for Marine Mammalogy," Costa said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  But he added that finding support for graduate students is becoming increasingly difficult and problematic due to increases in tuition and fees and declining state support for higher education.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "We are finding it increasingly difficult to compete for the best and brightest students due to a lack of graduate student support. The Rebecca and Steve Sooy Graduate Fellowship in Marine Mammals will go a long way toward solving this problem," Costa said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The history of marine mammal expertise at UCSC extends back to the campus's earliest years, starting with pioneering researcher Richard Peterson, who was later joined on the UCSC faculty by Burney Le Boeuf and Kenneth Norris. Le Boeuf, now a professor emeritus of ecology and evolutionary biology and associate vice chancellor for research, and Peterson studied primarily pinnipeds (seals and sea lions), while Norris was already internationally renowned for his research on cetaceans (dolphins and whales).<br>
</p>
<p>
  Marine mammal researchers at UCSC now cover an ever-widening range of expertise. They include Costa, who studies the physiological ecology of marine mammals, with a special emphasis on elephant seals; Donald Croll, assistant professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, who has been studying the relationship of oceanography to the foraging ecology of large whales; James Estes, adjunct professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, who is known internationally for his work on the role of sea otters in kelp forest communities and, more generally, the role of top predators in marine communities; Terrie Williams, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, who studies marine mammal locomotion and energetics; research biologist Stephen Insley, who studies acoustic ecology; and research biologists Colleen and Dave Kastak, who study the sensory ecology and physiology of marine mammals.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The Rebecca and Steve Sooy Graduate Fellowship in Marine Mammals will be administered by the Graduate Division, with the selection of fellows made in cooperation with the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology.<br>

        <title>UCSC welcomes Chancellor Designate Denton</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 03 Jan 2005 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>5285</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_5284" align="alignright" width="220"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/01/denton_visit1.05-01-03.220.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-5284" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/01/denton_visit1.05-01-03.220.jpg" alt="Chancellor Designate Denice Denton greeted members of the campus community at an informal reception outside the Media Theater.

<p>
  A standing-room-only crowd turned out to greet Chancellor Designate Denice D. Denton during her first visit to campus after being approved by the UC Regents as UCSC's ninth leader.
</p>
<p>
  Less than 24 hours after the announcement, Denton was welcomed to campus December 15 by UC President Robert C. Dynes, Acting Chancellor Martin M. Chemers, and several hundred people who filled the Media Theater.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "This has been a wonderful experience," said Denton. "I'm trying to enjoy it and take it all in."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Denton will take office February 14.
</p>
<p>
  She comes to UCSC from the University of Washington (UW), where she is dean of the College of Engineering--the first woman to lead such a school at a top U.S. research university. But she was clearly thrilled by her new affiliation.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "The University of California leads the United States and the world in public higher education," she said, noting that UC is thereby also at the forefront of the "challenges and opportunities" facing academia today, including scant resources.<br>
</p>
<p>
  While Denton's formal remarks focused on the campus's distinctions and her eagerness to help UCSC "reach its highest aspirations as a teaching and research university," she displayed an ease that bodes well for her tenure at the "campus in the redwoods."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Denton joked that her "ace in the hole" during the selection process--which she didn't play--was her collaborative research on <i>Tritonia,</i> a sea creature commonly known as a sea slug. After a slide of the creature was displayed behind her, she quipped that it has only six neurons and wondered aloud how many neurons banana slugs have.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Before asking for a show of hands of students, faculty, and staff in the audience, Denton remarked that, "I guess a few of you have had an opportunity to Google me, but I haven't had a chance to Google all of you yet."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Denton will take office in the middle of UCSC's long-range development planning process, and she cited campus partnerships with city and county leaders as "clearly crucial to the success of this campus." The campus is a "powerful driver of economic and social progress" locally, as well as in Silicon Valley, the Monterey Bay Area, and beyond, she said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Denton singled out UCSC's "celebration of diversity" as particularly attractive to her, noting that she looks forward to helping the campus "live up to that core value." Denton's record includes a strong commitment to diversity, outreach, and educational mentorship. In May, she received a White House award recognizing her work enhancing diversity in science and engineering.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Denton noted that her partner, Gretchen Kalonji, a professor of materials science and engineering at UW, was unable to join her because Kalonji was at a professional meeting in China. Following the presentation, Denton greeted members of the campus community at an informal reception outside the Media Theater.<br>
</p>
<p>
  More than 700 people applied for the top post at UCSC, a process that began in May, noted search committee member and UCSC chemistry professor Eugene Switkes.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "It was a sunny day when the committee was charged, and it's a sunny day this December 15 when we welcome Chancellor Designate Denton," said Switkes. "I look forward to working with you, Denice."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Dynes recited a string of adjectives he uses to describe the UCSC campus: "on the rise, launched, accelerating, on the move, moving forward." He said Denton joins a string of bright stars at the helm of UCSC, including former chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood, who is now provost of the UC system, and Acting Chancellor Chemers, the former dean of social sciences who was first appointed acting provost and executive vice chancellor after the departure of John Simpson.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "Marty stepped up not once but twice during sudden transitions in key leadership positions on the campus," said Dynes. "He didn't hesitate to lead with confidence and optimism."<br>
</p>
<p>
  "I've learned a lot about leadership from Marty--as he would lecture me quite often," Dynes quipped warmly, noting that leadership is Chemers' research area. "I know Marty is held in the highest regard here," concluded Dynes.<br>
</p>
<p>
  A standing ovation and enthusiastic applause greeted Chemers, who thanked the campus for the "faith and support" he'd received.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "It has been an honor and a privilege to serve this campus," Chemers said, urging colleagues to join him in helping ensure a smooth transition. "I look forward to returning to the faculty and doing my old job."<br>

        <title>Film series by Renee Tajima-Pena wins awards</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_5278" align="alignright" width="120"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/01/tajima_pena.120.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-5278" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2005/01/tajima_pena.120.jpg" alt="Renee Tajima-Pena" width="120" height="162" /></a>Renee Tajima-Pena[/caption]
<a name="content" id="content"></a>
<p>
  A documentary film by Renee Tajima-Pena, associate professor of community studies, has been recognized by the International Documentary Association.
</p>
<p>
  "The New Americans" series, which was broadcast on PBS stations last year, won a distinguished achievement award from the association in the limited series category, competing against films that included Martin Scorsese's <i>The Blues.</i> The seven-hour series was produced by Kartemquin Films and directed by five teams in five different countries; Tajima-Pena directed the Mexico story.
</p>
<p>
  Tajima-Pena also won an Alpert Award for the Arts in the film/video category from California Institute of the Arts (CalArts) and the Herb Alpert Foundation.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Established in 1994, the awards recognize five "early midcareer" artists, providing $50,000 fellowships in the fields of dance, film/video, music, theater, and visual arts. Each fellowship includes a weeklong residency at CalArts. Tajima-Pena will complete her residency in March, and her visit will include a screening of "The New Americans" in the new Disney Hall.
</p>
<p>
  On the 10th anniversary of the awards, Kip Cohen, president of the Herb Alpert Foundation, marked the milestone by remarking: "In a world gone fairly mad, the words, thoughts, and works of the American artist are a vital and necessary balance to counter the climate of manipulation and untruth that pervades government and big business, and taints the once-purer world of the media. The very least we can do is to publicly honor and reward the finest of our emerging outspoken voices who are now, and who have always been, our artists."

  The degree citation noted that Clifford has "for three decades challenged and changed the terms of humanistic inquiry as one of his generation's most original cultural interpreters," adding that "noted for its intellectual coherence, conceptual daring, and clarity of expression, his writing has reshaped the field of sociocultural anthropology while enjoying international influence among a wide range of scholars and students concerned to understand the fate of all cultures in the crucible of global modernity."

<p>
  Daniel Press, a professor of environmental studies, has been reappointed by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger to the Central Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board.
</p>
<p>
  Press, chair of environmental studies, recently completed a partial term to which he was appointed by former governor Gray Davis in 2002. His appointment to a full, four-year term was announced in December. It is a volunteer, part-time appointment.
</p>
<p>
  The Central Coast group is one of nine Regional Water Quality Control Boards that meet every six weeks under the auspices of the State Water Resources Control Board, which oversees water allocation and water quality protection in California.
</p>
<p>
  Regional boards set waste discharge standards, monitor water quality, and take enforcement action against violators.
</p>
<p>
  Regional board members evaluate water quality goals and implementation plans proposed by staff for each jurisdiction, recognizing local differences in climate, topography, geology, and hydrology and balancing factors such as the needs of industry, agriculture, municipal districts, recreation, and the environment.

<p>
  A gifted Spanish-language teacher, a public defender who successfully argued a case before the U.S. Supreme Court, and a dedicated scholarship adviser have been selected to receive the Alumni Association's highest honors for the 2004-05 year.
</p>
<p>
  M. Victoria Gonzalez Pagani will receive the Distinguished Teaching Award; Roberto Najera, the Alumni Achievement Award; and Cheryl Perazzo, the Outstanding Staff Award.
</p>
<p>
  The three will be honored at the Alumni Association Awards Luncheon at noon on February 5 at College Nine and College Ten Multipurpose Room at UCSC. The cost of the luncheon is $18; RSVPs may be made by calling (831) 459-2530 or <a href="http://www.alumni.ucsc.edu">online</a>.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Student evaluations of teacher M. Victoria Gonzalez Pagani, a leader in the field of language teaching and technology, stress her "extraordinary commitment of time and energy" noted Gildas Hamel, chair of UCSC's Llanguage Program. "I have been impressed by the great respect students have for her."<br>
</p>
<p>
  "She is so personally invested as a teacher that students cannot help but achieve for the sake of making her proud," one of her students, Lisa Peake, wrote in nominating her for the award. "Several other students in my classes with her have remarked to me that they must do the assignment because disappointing such a dedicated teacher is unthinkable."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Her colleagues describe her as generous in sharing her knowledge at professional gatherings, and note her numerous research projects aimed at increasing students' level of linguistic proficiency. Gonzalez Pagani received the Academic Senate's Teaching Excellence Award in 1995-96 and was nominated for the award three more times.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Alumni Achievement Award recipient Roberto Najera, who graduated in 1979 from UCSC's Merrill College with a bachelor's degree in sociology and later from Harvard Law School, was the child of a widowed farmworker, and spent much of his childhood picking vegetables on the Monterey coast.<br>
</p>
<p>
  A Contra Costa County deputy public defender in Martinez, Najera was an unlikely choice to argue a case before the Supreme Court. The David-and-Goliath nature of the case, heard in spring 2003, became even more dramatic when Najera was diagnosed with colon cancer. His tumor was removed, and he began chemotherapy shortly before arguing the case.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Propelling Najera forward was the belief that a 1993 California law retroactively extending the statute of limitations for child sexual abuse was unconstitutional because it violated the Constitution's stated ban on "ex post facto"--or retroactive--laws. "Even if it is for good intentions, you're rescinding the law," he told the <i>Contra Costa Times.</i> The Supreme Court agreed, overturning the law by a 5-4 vote.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Outstanding Staff Award recipient Cheryl Perazzo, scholarship coordinator for UCSC's Office of Financial Aid, has been described as "a miracle worker" for her efforts to help students. Perazzo, who has been at UCSC since 1984, organized and implemented the first-ever UCSC Scholars Day in 1996 for top high school students, resulting in record numbers of Regents Scholars being recruited to UCSC. She also works closely with re-entry students and the Page and Eloise Smith Scholastic Society--named for Cowell College's founding chancellor and his wife--which helps homeless and runaway youths, foster youth, orphans, and wards of the court pursue higher education.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Perazzo "is also a miracle worker," wrote Anne Smith Easley, daughter of Page and Eloise Smith. "She helps the students untie the bureaucratic knots that are part of dealing with any unwieldy institution," Easley added. "Through her efforts, many students are able to stay in school."<br>
</p>
<p>
  One student who came to UCSC as a former foster youth told of the many ways Perazzo went "above and beyond the call of duty" to help her find scholarships and other assistance. "I know I will look back to my college years and see Cheryl Perazzo as my guiding light," Heather Hazen wrote in her letter of nomination.<br>

  Research on the genome of the virus that causes severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has revealed an unusual molecular structure that looks like a promising target for antiviral drugs. A team of scientists at UCSC has determined the three-dimensional shape of this structure, an intricately twisted and folded segment of RNA. Their findings suggest that it may help the virus hijack the protein-building machinery of infected cells.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The SARS virus is a type of RNA virus, meaning that its genetic material is RNA rather than the more familiar DNA found in the chromosomes of everything from bacteria to humans. All RNA viruses have relatively high mutation rates, making their genomes highly variable. In HIV, for example, this high rate of mutation contributes to the rapid appearance of drug-resistant strains of the virus. In SARS and related viruses, however, one segment of the RNA genome--known as the s2m RNA--remains virtually unchanged.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "Because viral evolution has not been able to tamper with this sequence, it is clear that it must be of vital importance to the viruses that have it, but no one knows exactly what its function is," said William Scott, an associate professor of chemistry and biochemistry.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Scott's lab used the technique of x-ray crystallography to solve the structure of this RNA element with nearly atomic resolution, revealing where every one of the many thousands of atoms that make up the structure is situated. The results showed several unique and interesting features of the s2m RNA, including a distinctive fold that appears to be capable of binding to certain proteins involved in regulating protein synthesis in cells.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "The structure gives us strong hints about the function, because it forms a fold that has been implicated in binding a certain class of proteins," Scott said. "The structure itself also provides a starting point for designing antiviral drugs that might bind to this RNA and prevent it from doing whatever it is that is vital to the life cycle of the virus."<br>
</p>
<p>
  The UCSC researchers published their findings online in the journal <i>PLoS Biology</i> (<a href="http://www.plosbiology.org">http://www.plosbiology.org</a>). December 28, 2004. The first author of the paper is Michael Robertson, a postdoctoral researcher in Scott's lab. Robertson and Scott purified large amounts of s2m RNA, crystallized it, bombarded the crystals with x-rays, and determined the structure from the resulting pattern of x-ray scattering.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The other coauthors, in addition to Scott, are Manuel Ares, professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) professor; Haller Igel, a research associate in the Ares lab; David Haussler, professor of biomolecular engineering and a HHMI investigator; and Robert Baertsch, a graduate student working with Haussler.<br>
</p>
<p>
  All of the authors are affiliated with UCSC's Center for Molecular Biology of RNA. The strong interdisciplinary connections within the RNA center were a key to making the project possible, Scott said. The investigation brought together bioinformatics experts Baertsch and Haussler, who performed the computational sequence analysis of the genomes of SARS and related viruses; molecular biologists Igel and Ares, who cloned and chemically characterized the s2m RNA; and RNA crystallography experts Robertson and Scott.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "It's true that exciting discoveries are often made at the interfaces between disciplines, but it's rare that you see it happening in such a vivid way. This is a great example of interdisciplinary science at work," said Harry Noller, Sinsheimer Professor of Molecular Biology at UCSC and director of the RNA center.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Different types of RNA perform a variety of critical tasks in all living cells. Messenger RNA is the intermediary that carries genetic information from the DNA in the chromosomes to the cellular protein factories, called ribosomes, where the genetic information is translated into proteins. The ribosomes themselves are made primarily of ribosomal RNA.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The SARS s2m RNA is in an untranslated section at one end of each of the messenger RNAs that direct the production of viral proteins in infected cells.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "It hangs on the tail end of the messenger RNA like a little molecular knob," Noller said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Noller, an expert on the ribosome, noticed that a sharp, 90-degree bend in the s2m RNA structure is similar to a part of the ribosome. "It may only be a superficial resemblance, but you don't often see this kind of right-angle bend in RNA," Noller said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  This part of the ribosome and the proteins that bind to it are involved in the regulation of protein synthesis, leading Scott and his coauthors to hypothesize that the s2m RNA, by mimicking the ribosomal binding site, may serve to hijack the host cell's protein-synthesis machinery for use by the virus. This hypothesis will have to be tested by further studies, which are already under way in Ares's lab.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "The precise function is something they're going to figure out, no doubt about it, and it's bound to be something of major importance," Noller said. "When you see a whole class of viruses that have this absolutely conserved structural element, it tells you there's something really interesting going on here."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Sequence analysis by Haussler and Baertsch found that viruses in two families--coronaviruses (which include the SARS virus) and astroviruses--share the s2m element. About 75 percent of this sequence is absolutely invariant between viral species. Furthermore, an analysis of 38 different SARS variants found absolutely no variation within the s2m sequence.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Other scientists had previously noticed this highly conserved element in astroviruses and a few other viruses, and had given it the s2m name. But no one had any idea what the s2m RNA does that would explain why it is so highly conserved, Haussler said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  According to Scott, the UCSC team's investigation represents a novel approach in the field known as structural genomics. A more common approach in structural genomics is to determine the three-dimensional shape of a novel protein and compare it to the shapes of proteins with known functions to find clues to the function of the unknown protein.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "We have taken the methodology of conventional structural genomics and extended it to investigate the structure of the RNA genome itself," Scott said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Ultimately, this research could lead to the development of antiviral drugs that would bind to the s2m RNA and prevent it from carrying out its function. Such drugs might be effective against a range of coronaviruses and astroviruses. While the SARS virus is the most deadly of these, other coronaviruses are common causes of respiratory infections in humans and other animals. Although none of the other human coronaviruses have the s2m RNA, several important animal pathogens do and would be susceptible to a drug that targets s2m.<br>
