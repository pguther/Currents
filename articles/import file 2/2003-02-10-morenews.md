  <a name="bssf" id="bssf"></a>Major change for Banana Slug Spring Fair
</p>
<p>
  This year Banana Slug Spring Fair (BSSF) will focus only on alumni reunions and will not be an Admissions Office event. For a listing of BSSF alumni events, go to the Alumni Association <a href="http://www.ucsc.onlinecommunity.com/cgi-any/calendar_show.dll/display?sitename=UCSC&amp;id=69">events calendar</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The decision to eliminate admissions yield activities from BSSF is due to escalating costs and the status of construction on the west side of campus, according to a <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/messages/02-03/01-27.slug.html">memo</a> issued by Kevin Browne, executive director of admissions and university registrar, and Carolyn Christopherson, executive director of the Alumni Association.
</p>
<p>
  With construction disruption, the Admissions Office will be able to give prospective student visitors a better sense of the campus in groups of 31 than would be possible with crowds of 9,000 to 10,000 visitors, typical with BSSF.
</p>
<p>
  Browne asks the campus community to be conscious of Admissions Tour groups and prospective student visitors as they make that difficult decision of where to enroll next fall, and to offer whatever assistance they are able.

  <a name="friends" id="friends"></a>GLBT Friends Group launched
</p>
<p>
  Celebrating its fifth year of existence this year, UCSC's Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Resource Center has formed a "friends" group of students, staff, faculty, alumni, and community members committed to the enrichment of the center and its programs.<br>
  <br>
  The Friends of the GLBT Resource Center board hosted a staff and faculty mixer at the UCSC Inn in late January during which the center's first five years were celebrated in a multimedia presentation.<br>
  <br>
  In addition, a Friends Group membership drive was launched and $9,000 was raised. "The Center has already achieved so much and positively influenced the lives of so many of our students in it's first five years," said Dave Keller, president of the Friends group. "With the support of an active and viable Friends group, the future potential is incredible."<br>
  <br>
  Center director Deb Abbott said the establishment of the Friends group is especially timely given campuswide budget challenges. "The Friends will make a substantial difference in the center's capacity to maintain and expand its programs," she said.<br>
  <br>
  Abbott said the center is helping build UCSC's stature among GLBT students; UCSC finished in the top ten in one national survey and first in a UC systemwide survey. "We've developed great campus and community partnerships over the past five years," Abbott said.<br>
  <br>
  To learn more about or to become a charter member of the Friends of the GLBT Resource Center, visit the center's website (<a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/glbtcenter">www2.ucsc.edu/glbtcenter</a>) or send email to the Friends group (<a href="mailto:glbtfriends@ucsc.edu">glbtfriends@ucsc.edu</a>).<br>
