  Applicants invited to attend housing lottery on July 15
</p>
<p>
  If you've got questions about UCSC's new Housing Access Policy, you have one more chance to get some answers. The last of three housing forums at the Women's Center will be from 12:15 to 1:30 p.m. on Tuesday, July 8.
</p>
<p>
  Faculty and Staff Housing Manager Steve Houser will provide an overview on current housing stocks and the new housing policy, and answer questions at the forum. Two housing forums have already been held.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The final forum comes just a week before the onetime housing lottery for staff and non-senate academics. The lottery will take place on Tuesday, July 15, at Merrill Dining Hall from noon to 1:30 p.m.<br>
</p>
<p>
  All applicants are encouraged to attend the lottery. Applications must be submitted by 5 p.m. on July 11 to be considered for the lottery. All eligible employees interested in the for-sale program should e-mail <a href="mailto:facultyhousing@ucsc.edu">Faculty and Staff Housing</a> and ask to be placed on a waiting list for the for-sale program. Applicants should list their full names and Social Security or employee identification numbers.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Under the new Housing Access Policy, a fixed allocation of available rental and for-sale units will be offered to eligible faculty, staff, and non-Academic Senate academics under this formula:<br>
</p>
<p>
  * 80 percent faculty<br>
  * 15 percent staff<br>
  * 5 percent non-senate academics<br>
</p>
<p>
  Those planning to attend the housing forum are asked to RSVP to Faculty Housing by <a href="mailto:facultyhousing@ucsc.edu">e-mail</a> or by calling (831) 458-3506.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Additional information on the housing policy is available <a href="http://planning.ucsc.edu/pac/cwc.html">online</a>. Details on the kinds of housing for sale and for rent is also <a href="http://www.housing.ucsc.edu/housing/faculty.html">online</a>.
