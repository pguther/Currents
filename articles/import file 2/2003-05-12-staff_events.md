  Chancellor Greenwood will hold two campuswide staff events next week, the staff forum on Monday, May 19, and the annual staff appreciation breakfast on Wednesday, May 21.
</p>
<p>
  Greenwood will address a range of issues, including the budget, at her May 19 spring forum with staff from 12:30 to 1:40 p.m. at Earth &amp; Marine Sciences Room B206. (Governor Davis is scheduled to unveil his May revision of the budget on May 14.)<br>
</p>
<p>
  All staff members are also invited to attend "Pancakes and Jazz with M.R.C.," the annual free staff appreciation breakfast with the chancellor. The buffet-style breakfast will be served from 7:30 to 9:30 a.m. on May 21 at Stevenson Dining Hall.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The Kevin Mitchel quartet, which played at the opening of the University Center, will perform.
</p>
<p>
  Both events are sponsored by the Chancellor's Office and the Staff Advisory Board.<br>
