  <span class="sectionhead"><a name="farm" id="farm"></a>Sweet limes, apple trees, and salad bowls debut at UCSC Farm &amp; Garden Spring Plant Sale May 1-2<br>
  <br></span>Psst! Here's a hot tip for gardeners: Whether your summer tastes lean toward limeade or margaritas, you'll want to pick up a Bearss lime tree at the annual UC Santa Cruz Farm &amp; Garden Spring Plant Sale.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The sale, which features a dazzling array of organically raised vegetables, annual flowers, perennials, and herbs, will take place Saturday and Sunday, May 1-2, from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. in the Barn Theater parking lot at the intersection of Bay and High Streets at the base of campus.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The Bearss lime tree, also known as the Tahitian lime, bears a yellow fruit with a unique flavor somewhere between a lemon and a lime. The handsome shrub with dark green foliage thrives on the Central Coast. Available in one-gallon containers, the trees are priced to please at $6 each.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Also new this year is a limited selection of dwarf apple trees, including the best of the Farm &amp; Garden's heirloom and modern varieties. Grafted on root stock, these one-year-old trees won't bear fruit for two or three years, but the $6 price can't be beat. Varieties include Chehalis, Elstar, Fall Russet, Freyburg, Fuji, Golden Russet, Grime's Golden, Hudson's Golden Gem, Jonagold, Mollie's Delicious, Mutsu, and Yellow Newtown Pippin.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Finally, just in time for Mother's Day, the sale will feature 10-inch "salad bowls" preplanted with four to six varieties of half-grown salad greens, including a mix of mini romaines, heirloom butterhead lettuces, and cutting salad greens. Each bowl should yield two or three harvests for the ultimate in fresh salads.<br>
</p>
<p>
  As always, the selection will include more than 200 plant species, including heirloom varieties of tomatoes, as well as hot, mild, and sweet peppers. Six-packs of lettuces, broccoli, cauliflower, salad mix, and Asian greens will also be available. All plants are proven to grow well in the local area.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Sponsored by the Friends of the Farm &amp; Garden and the Center for Agroecology &amp; Sustainable Food Systems, the sale benefits the UCSC Apprenticeship in Ecological Horticulture. Members of the Friends will receive early entry from 9 to 10 a.m. on Saturday only and a 10 percent discount on purchases; memberships will be available at the sale beginning at 8:30 a.m. For more information, call (831) 459-3240.<br>

  <span class="sectionhead"><a name="faculty" id="faculty"></a>Central Coast landscapes by Art Department faculty and alumni at Arboretum spring exhibition May 3-30</span><br>
</p>
<p>
  An exhibition of works by faculty and alumni of the UCSC Art Department, titled The Natural Gaze: Landscapes of the Central Coast, will be featured at UCSC's Arboretum from May 3 to 30. A reception, including a panel discussion by the artists, will also take place on Saturday, May 8, from 4:30 to 6:30 p.m.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The exhibition vividly demonstrates the depth and range of interest in California coastal imagery among UCSC's faculty and alumni. Cocurated by art professor Frank Galuszka and department chair Norman Locks, the show gathers together painted and photographic landscape works by four faculty and two alumni artists, each created on location in the plein air tradition. "Given the interpretative emphasis upon Central Coast botanica, here at the Arboretum, this is an obvious and perfect setting for the show," said Galuszka.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The Arboretum exhibition will showcase paintings of Elkhorn Slough by art professor Jennie McDade, as well as paintings by Galuszka. Also displayed will be elegiac seascapes by alumnus painter Noah Buchanan, who teaches painting at Cabrillo College, the College of San Mateo, and through UCSC Extension. Representing photography will be the work of Professor Locks, Ken Alley, a UCSC lecturer in photography whose work explores the wetlands of Waddell Creek, and Andrew Stanbridge, an alum and teaching assistant at UCSC.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The Arboretum gallery is open daily from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. and is wheelchair accessible. Admission is free. For more information, contact the Sesnon Gallery (831) 459-3606.<br>

  <a name="seals" id="seals"></a>Professors host workshop on fur seal research
</p>
<p>
  Three UCSC professors hosted 18 scholars at a Pacific Rim-funded research planning workshop on northern fur seals in historical perspective that was held April 16 -19 at Long Marine Laboratory's Seymour Marine Discovery Center.<br>
  The gathering of researchers from Russia, Canada, the United States, and Mexico was hosted by Dan Costa, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, Diane Gifford-Gonzalez, professor of anthropology, and Paul Koch, professor of Earth sciences.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Participants reviewed the present status of fur seals and archaeological evidence that they were historically more widely distributed from Alaska to California. Participants included archaeologists, DNA experts, geologists, historical ecologists, and experts on modern northern and southern fur seal behavioral ecology and management.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Workshop members spent three days in plenary sessions and smaller focus groups, defining broad research questions and strategies and identifying funding sources to support further research. Field trips to Ano Nuevo State Reserve and Elkhorn Slough enriched participants' knowledge of the Monterey Bay region.<br>
