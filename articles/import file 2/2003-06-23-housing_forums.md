  Those looking for housing on campus may want to mark their calendars for several key dates in July.
</p>
<p>
  The new Housing Access Policy--which includes staff members and non-Senate academics as well as faculty members--will be discussed at campus forums on July 1, 3, and 8.<br>
</p>
<p>
  And July 11 is the deadline for eligible staff and non-Senate academics to apply for selection in the housing lottery.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Under the new Housing Access Policy, which applies to units managed by the Faculty and Staff Rental Program:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>A fixed allocation of available for-sale and rental units will be distributed to Academic Senate faculty (80 percent), non-Senate academics (5 percent), and staff (15 percent).<br>
  </li>
  <li>An employee must be 100 percent time with a minimum of a one-year appointment to be eligible to participate.
  </li>
  <li>Persons who have been employed by the university for more than two years will not be eligible for the rental apartments.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Rental applications may be <a href="http://www.housing.ucsc.edu/housing/facaparts.html">downloaded</a> and faxed to (831) 458-1937 or mailed to Faculty Housing Office, Hagar Court Community Room, Santa Cruz, CA 95064.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Specifics on for-sale and rental opportunities will be provided during informational sessions at the Women's Center on these dates:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Tuesday, July 1, 3-5 p.m.
  </li>
  <li>Thursday, July 3, 12:15-1:30 p.m.
  </li>
  <li>Tuesday, July 8, 12:15-1:30 p.m.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Those planning to attend are asked to RSVP to Faculty Housing by <a href="mailto:facultyhousing@ucsc.edu">e-mail</a> or by calling (831) 458-3506.<br>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Lottery to be held on July 15</b><br>
</p>
<p>
  All eligible employees interested in the for-sale program should <a href="mailto:facultyhousing@ucsc.edu">e-mail</a> Faculty Housing and ask to be placed on a waiting list for the for-sale program.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Due to anticipated high demand, a lottery will be held to select 50 current staff and 15 current non-Senate academics for placement on their respective waiting lists. After this lottery, only newly hired employees will be eligible to participate in the for-sale program.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The onetime lottery will be held on Tuesday, July 15, at Merrill Dining Hall from noon to 1:30 p.m. All applicants are encouraged to attend. Applications must be submitted by 5 p.m. on July 11 to be considered for the lottery.
</p>
<p>
