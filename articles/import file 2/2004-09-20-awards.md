</p>
<p>
  Social sciences bibliographer Sheila O'Hare has been awarded a $7,500 competitive research grant from the Librarians Association of the University of California (LAUC), the librarians' equivalent of the Academic Senate. She will compile a chronological record of all California legal executions, beginning with the authorization of the death penalty in the Criminal Practices Act of 1851 and continuing to the present day.
</p>
<p>
  O'Hare argues that even though the debate over the death penalty is ongoing and far from settled, a comprehensive reference source for California legal executions does not exist. Her research will culminate in a book containing a short narrative of each case and its unique legal, procedural, or sociological issues; demographic information for the executed individual and victims; images; and bibliographic references. O'Hare's publication will be structured to benefit academic and public libraries, death penalty opponents and advocates, legal practitioners, historians, criminal justice scholars, and the general public.
