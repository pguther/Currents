  Eight faculty members have received 2003-04 Excellence in Teaching Awards from the Academic Senate Committee on Teaching.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Given each spring, the awards honor those who have demonstrated exemplary and inspiring teaching.<br>
  <br>
  Nominations are submitted by students, and the committee also reads a statement on teaching written by the nominee, as well as a letter from the department chair. The committee looks for evidence that the nominee has thought deeply about teaching and learning, and effectively applies that thinking in the classroom.<br>
</p>
<p>
  This year's awards were presented by Acting Chancellor Martin M. Chemers and Committee on Teaching Chair Judith Habicht-Mauche on May 28 at University House. The names of recipients were announced during the final Academic Senate meeting of 2004 on May 21. The awards include $500 in cash for faculty members and $200 for graduate students.<br>
