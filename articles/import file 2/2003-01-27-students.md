<p>
  Six UCSC students, who San Jose police say were present during a fraternity<br>
  brawl in that city on January 21, will be interviewed by the UCSC judicial<br>
  officer to determine if their behavior warrants disciplinary action.<br>
</p>
<p>
  UCSC administrators have also decided to temporarily suspend the UCSC chapter of the students' fraternity, Pi Alpha Phi, pending an investigation to determine if the chapter has violated UCSC regulations.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The six students were among approximately 70 questioned by San Jose police following an early-morning fight that involved members of San Jose State University chapters of Pi Alpha Phi and Lambda Phi Epsilon.
</p>
<p>
  One person died during the fight and numerous other participants were injured; all of the victims were SJSU students.<br>
