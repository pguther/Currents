  <li>Display of the actual payment date, in addition to the payroll period ending date

  <li>Display of year-to-date tax-deferred plan information, by plan
  </li>
  <li>Display of year-to-date gross earnings, in addition to year-to-date tax reportable earnings
  </li>

  UCSC established a new health sciences major last year as part of an initiative to better serve students interested in careers in health care. Caroline Berger, health sciences internship coordinator, said she was gratified by the response from the local health care community when she began organizing the new lecture series.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "There are so many doctors in the local community who want to speak to students and make connections with the campus, it's been very exciting to make contact with them," she said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Additional presentations in the series are scheduled for February 11 and March 5. For more information, contact Caroline Berger at <a href="mailto:cberger@biology.ucsc.edu">cberger@biology.ucsc.edu</a>.<br>
