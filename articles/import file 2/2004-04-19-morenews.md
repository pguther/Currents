  <a name="outreach" id="outreach"></a>Prospective UCSC students speak out for outreach programs
</p>
<p>
  Approximately 150 prospective UCSC students, touring the campus on Friday,<br>
  staged a rally to raise support for the outreach programs that Governor<br>
  Schwarzenegger's 2004-05 budget proposal would eliminate.
</p>
<p>
  The midday rally began at Quarry Plaza and ended with a march through campus to the Women's Center. Acting Chancellor Martin M. Chemers and Interim Campus Provost Margaret Delaney were in attendance, lending support to the threatened programs--and the access they foster.
</p>
<p>
  "Access to education should be like a baseball game," the chancellor said.<br>
  "The field should be level and everyone should know the rules. And that's<br>
  what access is all about."

  <span class="sectionhead"><a name="haddad" id="haddad"></a>Brent Haddad to be inaugural speaker for new Science &amp; Engineering Library lecture series</span><br>
</p>
<p>
  The Science &amp; Engineering Library has announced a new lecture series, titled "<a href="http://library.ucsc.edu/science/synergy">Synergy: Explorations in Science and Society</a>," which will focus on UCSC research, as well as teaching and grants in science and engineering, with a view toward their impact on society. The first lecture will feature Brent Haddad, associate professor of environmental studies, on April 27 at 4 p.m. in the S&amp;E Library Current Periodicals Room.
</p>
<p>
  Haddad's lecture, titled "Not an Accident? Understanding Why One Billion People Worldwide Lack Reliable Drinking Water," will explore how Coalition Theory, a branch of economic game theory applied to international relations, can help explain who gets reliable drinking water and who doesn't. Haddad will also discuss his recommendations for improving worldwide access to drinking water.
</p>
<p>
  Haddad is an authority on water issues and in 1999 published the book <i>Rivers of Gold: Designing Markets to Allocate Water in California.</i> He is currently working on a new book in which he will discuss the issue of worldwide potable water.<br>

</p>
<p>
  UCSC played host April 2-4 to the 2004 <a href="http://www.pacificmasters.org/index.shtml">Pacific Masters Swimming</a><br>
  Championships, an event that raised more than $17,000 for UCSC's aquatic<br>
  programs.
</p>
<p>
  More than 750 swimmers, ages 19 to 90, participated in the weekend event, held at the East Field House pool.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Nine masters national records were broken. See <a href="http://www.pacificmasters.org/comp/results.shtml">complete results</a>. One of the record-breaking swimmers was Tod Spieker (400 individual medley record), who has been a longtime supporter of UCSC's aquatic programs and is a trustee of the UC Santa Cruz Foundation. His gifts enabled the campus to purchase the pool's original computerized timing and scoreboard system and funded a recent upgrade to the system.<br>

  Additional information on both programs is available at the <a href="http://www.cavhs.org">California Virtual High School</a> and <a href="http://www.ucgateways.org">UC Gateways</a> web sites.<br>
