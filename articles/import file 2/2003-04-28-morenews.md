  <a name="shuttle" id="shuttle"></a>Adaptive optics researcher aids space shuttle investigation<br>
</p>
<p>
  Julian Christou, a research specialist at UCSC's Center for Adaptive Optics, used his image processing skills to help NASA in its investigation of the space shuttle <i>Columbia</i> disaster.
</p>
<p>
  <i>Columbia</i> broke up during reentry on February 1, killing all seven astronauts aboard.
</p>
<p>
  Christou, who has done pioneering work on a method of image processing called "blind deconvolution," contacted former colleagues at Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico in February to see if he could help enhance images of the shuttle.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The Air Force referred Christou to NASA, which sent him two photos taken at Kirtland two minutes before the shuttle broke up. Using his blind deconvolution technique, Christou was able to make the images much clearer for investigators.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "It was very helpful," said Lt. Col. Woody Woodyard, spokesman for the Columbia Accident Investigation Board.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The investigation board has been examining the photos for anything out of the ordinary, Woodyard said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The enhanced images were discussed in the investigation board's March 18 <a href="http://www.caib.us/news/press_briefings/">press briefing</a>. They were also featured in an article about the investigation that appeared in <i>Aviation Week and Space Technology.<br></i><a href="#farm"><i>back to top</i></a><br>

  <a name="agriculture" id="agriculture"></a>U.S. agriculture is focus of series of panel discussions
</p>
<p>
  Make informed decisions about personal food choices and learn more about agricultural public policy and how to get involved in sustainable agriculture advocacy. The UCSC Center for Agroecology &amp; Sustainable Food Systems is holding a series of panel discussions during the next few weeks, titled Critical Perspectives on the U.S. Agro-Food System. The discussions have three aims:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>To provide undergraduate students and the broader campus community with a historical context for current issues in the U.S. food and agricultural system;
  </li>
  <li>To introduce the most significant social and environmental risks and consequences associated with the development of U.S. agriculture; and
  </li>
  <li>To introduce the various concepts of sustainable agriculture, the work of the Center for Agroecology &amp; Sustainable Food Systems, and anticipated directions for sustainable agriculture's development.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The first session, the Shaping of the U.S. Agro-Food System, will take place on Wednesday, April 30, from 7:30 to 9 p.m. in Room 240, College Eight. The panel will be Bill Friedland, professor emeritus of community studies, and Andrew Marshall, a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Environmental Studies. Friedland's research interests include the political economy of agriculture and globalization; Marshall's interests include alternative and community food systems, political economy of agricultural biotechnology, and U.S. agricultural policy.
</p>
<p>
  Subsequent panels will be held on May 7, 14, and 21, all in Room 240 at College Eight from 7:30 to 9 p.m. For more information, contact Martha Brown at <a href="mailto:mtbrown@ucsc.edu">mtbrown@ucsc.edu</a>.<br>
