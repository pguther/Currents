  The third annual Honored Faculty, Honored Books Program this week will celebrate the bond between the written word and the achievement of scholars.

  The campus community is invited to attend a ceremony and reception in the Science &amp; Engineering Library at 2:30 p.m. on Thursday, November 13, to celebrate the honored faculty and their selected books.<br>
</p>

  Each honored book is added to the library collection and inscribed with a personalized bookplate in honor of the scholar who selected it.

<p>
  The library maintains a commemorative <a href="http://library.ucsc.edu/science/honor/2003/index.html">web site</a> that showcases the titles faculty have selected along with their descriptions of the significance of the books to their lives and careers.<br>
