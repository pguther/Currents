  The UC Santa Cruz police are participating in a countywide campaign targeting drivers who are impaired due to intoxication. The holiday campaign this year begins on December 17 and ends January 3.
</p>
<p>
  UCSC police officers will be working the west side of Santa Cruz in addition to the campus, as the campus will be closed for much of the time, according to Nancy Carroll, assistant police chief.
</p>
<p>
  Posters for the campaign (at right), showing the badges of the nine participating enforcement agencies, will be on display throughout the county.<br>
