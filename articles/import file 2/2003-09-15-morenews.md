</p>
<p>
  UCSC faculty and students in the <a href="http://csl.cse.ucsc.edu/">Storage Systems Research Center</a> (SSRC) met with computer industry representatives last week to exchange ideas on the future of data storage. The SSRC is focused on improving the performance, security, and reliability of data storage systems.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Attending the SSRC Retreat were industry sponsors of the center's research, including Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, OnStor, Overland Storage, and Veritas. Industry sponsors provide about $250,000 a year in support of SSRC research. The center also receives major funding from the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy. Researchers from Lawrence Livermore and Los Alamos National Laboratories also attended the meeting.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "The retreat is an opportunity for us to present our research and get feedback from industry sponsors. We want to know what they think the most interesting problems are for us to work on," said SSRC director Darrell Long, a professor of computer science in the Baskin School of Engineering.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The SSRC includes eight faculty members and more than 20 graduate students working on a range of projects involving storage system architecture, real-time systems, security, data mining, performance evaluation, and reliability.<br>
