  More than 100 tables for student organizations, services, and sports teams will be set up at the annual fall festival from 3 to 6 p.m. at the East Field House Upper Field on September 21.
</p>
<p>
  Cosponsored by the Office of Physical Education, Recreation, Sports, and Wellness (OPERS) and the Office of Student Life, the event includes a barbecue dinner and music by the band Dub Congress. The barbecue dinner will be free for students with a meal card and $8 for others. (Campus dining halls will be closed the evening of September 21.)
</p>
<p>
  The fall festival is designed to familiarize new students with OPERS programs and facilities and provides a chance for student organizations and student services units to meet and talk with students in an informal setting. It also provides a festive environment for new students to meet other new students.
