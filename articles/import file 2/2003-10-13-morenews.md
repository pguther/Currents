  <a name="lecture" id="lecture"></a>Lecture examines possibility of life on other planets
</p>
<p>
  If life exists on Mars, how would we know? Scientists have been grappling with this deceptively simple question for years. Kenneth Nealson, the Wrigley Professor of Geobiology at the University of Southern California, is a leading authority on this issue, which he will address in a public lecture on Thursday, October 16.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Nealson's talk is the third Halliday Lecture, a public lecture series sponsored by the UCSC Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics and the UC Observatories/Lick Observatory. The lecture, "Recognizing Life Under Strange and Distant Rocks," begins at 8 p.m. in the Music Center Recital Hall. It is free and open to the public.Link to earlier <a href="http://currents.ucsc.edu/03-04/10-06/halliday.html"><i>Currents</i> story.</a><br>

  <a name="marine" id="marine"></a>UCSC marine mammal experts to speak at forum for teachers
</p>
<p>
  Three faculty experts on marine mammals will discuss their research at the California Academy of Sciences next month at the academy's <a href="http://www.basa.info/pub/basa_res/13">19th Annual BioForum for Science Teachers</a>.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Terrie Williams, James Estes, and Daniel Costa, all professors of ecology and evolutionary biology (Estes is an adjunct professor), will talk about "Marine Mammals: Exceptional and Endangered." Their discussion will be moderated by David Lindberg, chair of the Department of Integrative Biology at UC Berkeley.<br>
</p>
<p>
  All three researchers are based at the Center for Ocean Health at Long Marine Laboratory. Williams studies the physiology of marine mammals ranging from sea otters to dolphins. Estes is an expert on sea otters and the ecology of coastal marine ecosystems. Costa's research focuses on the foraging ecology and energetics of pinnipeds (seals and sea lions) and seabirds. Costa, a fellow of the California Academy of Sciences, is currently featured in an article about his research on the <a href="http://www.calacademy.org/science_now/academy_research.html">academy's web site</a>.<br>
</p>
<p>
  BioForum, now in its 19th year, is a series on current science topics of interest to educators. Most attendees are high school science teachers, although the audience also includes middle school teachers, community college teachers, docents, and student teachers. Each BioForum includes three presentations by renowned scientists related to the selected topic.<br>
