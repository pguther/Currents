</p>
<p>
  The new <a href="http://ucenter.ucsc.edu/">University Center</a> will officially open its doors on Thursday, January 30, and faculty and staff are invited to join in the grand-opening festivities. Between 11:30 a.m. and 1:30 p.m., center staff will serve a complimentary sampling of food from the restaurant's menu, and there will be drawings for prizes. (A late-afternoon event, originally scheduled, has been postponed until the center can obtain a liquor license.)
</p>
<p>
  The center is located on the top floor of the Colleges Nine/Ten Dining Hall Commons. Parking is very limited at Colleges Nine/Ten, so people are encouraged to take the bus. "Perimeter" campus shuttles and Metro buses drop off and pick up passengers on a regular basis on McLaughlin Drive adjacent to Colleges Nine/Ten (on the north side) and the Health Center (on the south side).
