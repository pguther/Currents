  The next Staff Advisory Board-sponsored forum to keep campus employees informed about the work of the Executive Budget Committee has been moved to Classroom Unit 2 on Wednesday, January 7. The time has also been changed; the forum will be from 12:30 p.m. to 1:30 p.m.
</p>
<p>
  Workers' compensation is the topic of the forum, which was originally scheduled for BayTree Conference Room D.
</p>
<p>
  On December 3, the UCSC team charged with streamlining campus purchasing operations presented its work to an overflow crowd of about 100 people. Sessions on November 5 and November 17 focused on campus efforts to streamline procedures in human resources and the time-and-attendance system.
