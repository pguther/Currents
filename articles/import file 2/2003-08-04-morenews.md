</p>
<p>
  The Baskin School of Engineering hosted 125 high school students from around the country in July as part of the National Youth Leadership Forum on Technology. The nine-day forum, based at the Fairmont Hotel in San Jose, included field trips to several universities and high-tech companies.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The students who visited UCSC got a sense of what it would be like to study engineering here, touring the campus and the engineering school and hearing presentations from engineering dean Steve Kang and other faculty members.<br>
