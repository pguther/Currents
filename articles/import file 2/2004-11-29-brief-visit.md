  After 38 years in the California Legislature, Senator John Vasconcellos is retiring. Before he leaves office, he is touring the state to say farewell to friends and supporters in what he has dubbed his "Victory Lap Tour." He will attend a UCSC reception in his honor on Monday, November 29, from 4 p.m. to 5 p.m. in the Ringold Rotunda Room of the University Center.

  The event, which is sponsored by Acting Chancellor Martin Chemers and the Center for Justice, Tolerance, and Community, will give the campus community an opportunity to recognize Vasconcellos's contributions to higher education. Guests are welcome.
