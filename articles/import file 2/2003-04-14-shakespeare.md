<p>
  Shakespeare Santa Cruz (SSC) has just announced the lineup for its 2003 Summer Festival. Noel Coward's <i>Private Lives</i> will join Shakespeare's <i>Hamlet</i> and <i>The Comedy of Errors</i> for a six-week run from July 15 to August 24 on the UCSC campus.
</p>
<p>
  "This is a season of the classics, entertaining plays that have shaped how we look at the world," noted Managing Director Marcus Cato. "These are all must-see plays."
</p>
<p>
  <i>Private Lives,</i> Coward's stylish and hilarious examination of love and marriage, kicks off the repertory season at the UCSC Mainstage. Directed by Kent Gash, this elegant and sharp-witted comedy will also feature Jonathan Brody at the piano singing Noel Coward songs.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Confusion, chaos, and comedy will ensue when Shakespeare's lively story of two sets of twins, <i>The Comedy of Errors,</i> hits SSC's Festival Glen. Director William Partlan celebrates Santa Cruz by setting this production in our very own locale.
</p>
<p>
  UCSC's unparalleled outdoor theater will also be the scene of Shakespeare's great psychological masterpiece, <i>Hamlet,</i> directed by SSC Artistic Director Risa Brainin.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "Shakespeare Santa Cruz is one of the few repertory companies in the country," Cato observed. "The fun of 'rep' is in seeing the same actors in two different roles--sometimes in the same day--or seeing the Festival Glen in two completely different moods. The plays reflect off each other, offering new and surprising insights."<br>
</p>
<p>
  SSC will also offer a newly commissioned world premiere of <i>The Emperor's New Clothes</i> for its holiday shows in November and December. Based on the Hans Christian Anderson fairy tale, this production will also be directed by Brainin.<br>
