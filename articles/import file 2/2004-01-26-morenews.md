</p>
<p>
  <img align="right" height="166" src="../art/earthslug_logo.gif" width="150" alt="">The campus community is invited to attend UCSC Earth Summit 2004, the third annual gathering of students, faculty, and staff to develop the campus's "Blueprint for a Sustainable Campus."<br>
</p>
<p>
  The event, sponsored by the Student Environmental Center, will take place Friday, January 30, from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. in Conference Room D of the Bay Tree Building. Featured speakers include California State Assemblyman and UCSC alum John Laird, Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood, UC Student Regent Mathew Murray, and San Francisco architect Anthony Bernheim. Because seating is limited, participants are asked to RSVP by sending e-mail to <a href="mailto:blueprint@ucsc.edu">blueprint@ucsc.edu</a>.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Summit participants will assess the campus's efforts to become more sustainable, including progress on action items that were identified at last year's summit. Working groups will address areas that include the UCSC Long-Range Development Plan, campus ecosystem preservation, campus food systems and social justice, renewable energy, curriculum development, waste prevention, green building, green purchasing, and transportation.<br>
</p>
<p>
  At the systemwide level, the UC Regents' policy on green building and clean energy is moving forward, and a working definition of sustainability is being developed.
