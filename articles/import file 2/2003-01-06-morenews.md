  <a name="natsci" id="natsci"></a><span class="sectionhead">Natural Sciences renamed the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences<br></span>
</p>
<p>
  The Division of Natural Sciences has changed its name to the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences. The new name is more reflective of the division's mission, is better understood by the general public, and is more consistent with other UC campuses, said the division's dean, David Kliger.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Formal approval of the name change was granted by UC's Office of the President in December.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The change was endorsed by the division's department chairs and the Committee on Planning and Budget. The renaming does not involve any programmatic changes, organizational changes, or changes in any instructional or research programs.<br>

  <a name="calendar" id="calendar"></a>Finalized campus calendar for 2003-04 now available
</p>
<p>
  The <a href="http://reg.ucsc.edu/calendar/2003_04.html">campus calendar</a> for the 2003-04 academic year has been finalized and is now available on the web at <a href="http://reg.ucsc.edu/calendar/2003_04.html">http://reg.ucsc.edu/calendar/2003_04.html.</a> The calendar includes several modifications and has been approved by Campus Provost Simpson. The three primary changes are:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>In fall 2003, classes begin on Thursday, September 25, rather than Wednesday, September 24, thus restoring valuable orientation time especially important for placing first-year students in appropriate writing classes.<br>
  </li>
  <li>In winter 2004, instruction begins on Monday, January 5, rather than Tuesday, January 6, and the advising day is eliminated, thus making it possible for classes to end on Friday, March 12, rather than Tuesday, March 16. As a result, there is no need for final exams to be scheduled on Saturday, and the quarter ends on Thursday, March 18, rather than Sunday, March 21, allowing for a spring break that includes a full week with two weekends.<br>
  </li>
  <li>In Spring 2004, instruction begins on Monday, March 29, rather than Tuesday, March 30, thereby restoring the required day of instruction lost by starting classes a day later in the fall.<br>
  </li>
</ul>

  <span class="sectionhead"><a name="pruning" id="pruning"></a>Learn how to get the most out of your fruit trees at a pruning workshop on January 11</span><br>
</p>
<p>
  Fruit tree expert Orin Martin will offer all the tips you need to prune your pome fruit trees (apples and pears) successfully at a morning workshop at the Farm on Saturday, January 11, from 10 a.m. to noon.
</p>
<p>
  Proper pruning will improve the health, appearance, and productivity of your fruit trees. Martin, a fruit tree expert and manager of the Alan Chadwick Garden at UCSC, has been cultivating trees at the Chadwick Garden for 25 years.<br>

  Fees for the workshop, which are payable the day of the class, are $5-$10 (sliding scale) for members of the Friends of the UCSC Farm &amp; Garden, and $10 for nonmembers. No preregistration is necessary. Wear warm clothes; heavy rain cancels. Note that the Stone Fruits Pruning Workshop, focusing on peaches and plums, will take place January 25.

  <span class="sectionhead"><a name="enron" id="enron"></a>Federal court rules to keep most defendants in Enron shareholders' lawsuit</span><br>
  <br>
  The federal judge handling the Enron Corp. securities lawsuit ruled December 20 against several major financial institutions, law firms, and the Arthur Andersen accounting firm, substantially denying most defendants' motions to be dismissed from the case. The ruling clears the way for Enron shareholders to begin the process of depositions and evidence discovery in the case.<br>
  <br>
  In April 2002, the University of California, as lead plaintiff, filed a consolidated complaint that added nine financial institutions, two law firms, and other new individual defendants to a list that already included 29 current and former Enron executives and Arthur Andersen LLP.
