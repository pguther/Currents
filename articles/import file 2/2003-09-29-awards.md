  <span class="sectionhead"><a name="pettigrew" id="pettigrew"></a>Thomas Pettigrew to advise German government on immigration issues</span>
</p>
<p>
  The German government has appointed Thomas F. Pettigrew, research professor of social psychology, to the advisory committee of the Science Center of Berlin's project, "Intercultural Conflict and Societal Integration."<br>
</p>
<p>
  The appointment is the latest accolade for Pettigrew, who specializes in racial prejudice. As a New Century Scholar named earlier this year by the U.S. Fulbright Foreign Scholarship Board, he has been conducting research on the reactions to the millions of new immigrants to Western Europe. He has been hosted by Ulrich Wagner, a professor at Philipps University at Marburg, Germany.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Since 1988, Pettigrew has studied attitudes toward Europe's new immigrants, which he said reflect "all the things we have learned about prejudice around the world."<br>
