  David Kliger, dean of the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences, in a memo to the division, announced the appointment of two faculty members as associate deans for research. Eli Silver, professor of Earth sciences and director of the Center for Remote Sensing, will focus on research endeavors for the physical sciences; and chemistry professor and department chair Joseph Konopelski will focus on research efforts within the biological and biomedical sciences.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The highest priorities for both associate deans for 2004-05, according to the memo, will be engaging department chairs and faculty in discussions to initiate and pursue potential research endeavors with the University Affiliated Research Center (UARC) (see recent <a href="http://currents.ucsc.edu/04-05/10-04/uarc.asp">Currents article</a>) and to identify needs for core facilities that could enhance our faculty's competitiveness when seeking extramural grants.
</p>
<p>
  Both associate deans will also be available to facilitate the flow of information and interactions with the Office of the Vice Chancellor for Research, including requests for matching funds.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Once UARC and core facilities opportunities have been sufficiently explored, the associate deans for research will facilitate meetings between groups of faculty to define and prioritize collaborative projects with high potential for impact, visibility, and fundability, Kliger said.<br>
