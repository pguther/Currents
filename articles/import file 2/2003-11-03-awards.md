  Sociologist's book on high school girls receives Critics' Choice Award
</p>
<p>
  <img align="right" height="230" src="../art/bettie_book.150.jpg" width="150" alt="">Julie Bettie, associate professor of sociology, has received the Critics' Choice Award from the American Educational Studies Association (AESA) for her book <i>Women Without Class: Girls, Race, and Identity</i> (Berkeley, Calif.: University of California Press, 2003).<br>
</p>
<p>
  The award was announced during AESA's annual conference, which was held in Mexico City October 29 through November 2. Based on research conducted with girls at a Central Valley high school, Bettie's book shows the many ways in which young women's lives are shaped by class, race, and gender.<br>
</p>
<p>
  AESA is an academic organization comprised primarily of college and university professors who teach and conduct research in the field of education using one or more of the liberal arts disciplines of philosophy, history, politics, sociology, anthropology, or economics. Each year, several members participate on the Critics' Choice Committee, nominating books they feel are outstanding titles that may be of interest to scholars.
