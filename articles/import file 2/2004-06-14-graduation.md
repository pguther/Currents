  Caps and gowns seemed to be everywhere as UCSC's 10 colleges and the Jack Baskin School of Engineering held commencements over the weekend.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Starting things off on Friday, June 11, was the Graduate Division commencement, with Acting Chancellor Martin M. Chemers the keynote speaker.
</p>
<p>
  Commencements at Merrill, Porter, Cowell, and Oakes Colleges, as well as College Eight, College Nine, and College Ten, were held on Saturday.
</p>
<p>
  Crown College and the Jack Baskin School of Engineering commencements were celebrated on Sunday.
</p>
<p>
  Nearly 2,000 students were candidates for bachelor of arts, music, or science degrees. Also this spring, 232 students were eligible to receive master of arts or science degrees (of these students, 114 will complete UCSC's Department of Education master's program in late summer), and 64 students were candidates for doctorates. A small number of students received graduate certificates.<br>
</p>
<p>
  In the two prior quarters of the current academic year, many other UCSC students earned undergraduate or graduate degrees: 738 undergraduates earned bachelor's degrees at the end of the fall or winter quarters, 70 students earned master's degrees, and 37 students earned Ph.D.s. An undetermined number of other UCSC students will also complete their work toward degrees this summer, in the academic year's fourth quarter.<br>
