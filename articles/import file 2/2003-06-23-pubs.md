  Patricia Zavella

<p>
  <img align="right" height="272" src="../art/zavella_bookcover.180.jpg" width="180" alt="">Patricia Zavella, professor of Latin American and Latino studies, coedited the new book, <i>Perspectives on Las Americas: A Reader in Culture, History, and Representation</i> (Oxford, England: Blackwell Publishing, 2003).<br>
</p>
<p>
  The book examines the historical, cultural, economic, and political integration of Latina/os across the Americas and demonstrates the limits of neatly demarcating the regions of "Latin America" and the "United States."<br>
</p>
<p>
  The field of area studies has been transformed in recent years as political economies have changed and new theoretical frameworks have gained influence. Zavella and her coeditors compiled a collection designed to challenge the barriers between Latina/o studies and Latin American/Caribbean studies. Perspectives on Las Americas provides a core text that offers instructors, students, and interested readers the theoretical tools and case studies necessary to rethink transnational realities and identities.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Zavella's coeditors are Matthew C. Gutmann, Felix V. Matos Rodriguez, and Lynn Stephen.
