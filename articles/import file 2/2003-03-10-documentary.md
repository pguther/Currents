  <i>The Roots of California Photography: The Monterey Legacy,</i> an hourlong documentary chronicling the contributions of internationally known Monterey Bay Area photographers who profoundly influenced the world of photography and art, is the culmination of a three-year effort by the <a href="http://www.montereyart.org">Monterey Museum of Art,</a> in association with <a href="http://www.ucsc-extension.edu">UCSC Extension.</a>
</p>
<p>
  The film will be distributed nationally by American Public Television. KTEH in Silicon Valley is the presenting station for the film, which will be broadcast on 53 PBS stations. KTEH first aired the film in January, and it will be rebroadcast at 5 p.m. on Sunday, March 23, on KTEH/Silicon Valley Public Television's "video i" independent film showcase. It will be made available nationwide in April to other public television stations.
</p>
<p>
  The film captures the contributions of photographers whose work shaped thinking not only about photographic style and techniques, but also art in general. It features Ansel Adams, Wynn and Edna Bullock, and the Westons--Edward, Brett and Cole--among others, whose work in the 1920s, '30s and beyond taught the world new ways of seeing everything from simple everyday objects to California's majestic forests and rugged coastline.<br>

  According to Marc D'Estout, director of UCSC Extension's Art and Design Department, the development of the program was a labor of love. "We wanted to capture the great talent and vision of these photographers, but we also wanted to encourage others to learn from the roots they planted here--to continue experimenting, learning and innovating."<br>
</p>
<p>
  UCSC Extension has been offering a photography program since 1965, and several photographers featured in the film have taught or currently teach Extension classes.<br>
