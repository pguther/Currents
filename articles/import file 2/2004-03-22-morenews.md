</p>
<p>
  Do you enjoy gardening, learning about food and farming issues, and sharing your enthusiasm and knowledge with others? If the answer is "yes," then consider becoming a volunteer docent at the 25-acre organic farm and 3-acre Alan Chadwick Garden.<br>
</p>
<p>
  A docent training will take place on six Tuesday afternoons from 4 to 7 p.m., beginning April 6 and ending May 11, at the Farm's Louise Cain Gatehouse. The first session will include a no-obligation orientation for those who want to know more about the opportunities available to docents.<br>
</p>
<p>
  During the training sessions, participants will learn about organic farming and gardening practices, issues in sustainable agriculture, and the research that takes place at the Farm. Docents will also have the chance to do hands-on work in the Farm &amp; Garden's greenhouses, gardens, and fields. After completing the training, docents are asked to lead one to two tours a month and will be encouraged to take part in enrichment meetings on such topics as bee keeping, crop planning, birds of the Farm, and pest control.<br>
</p>
<p>
  A $30 fee covers the cost of materials, a docent manual, parking passes, and an organic cotton T-shirt. Docents will receive a yearlong membership to the Friends of the UCSC Farm &amp; Garden, which includes discounts at plant sales, and reduced or free entry to Farm &amp; Garden classes and events.<br>
</p>
<p>
