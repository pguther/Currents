  The Staff Advisory Board and Staff Human Resources are sponsoring the 2005 Thumbs Up Award Program. A Thumbs Up Award is a small form of recognition that can be given to an individual staff member, a team, or an academic in an administrative role (dean, department chair, etc.) for special service rendered as a member of the campus community. Each nominee wins an award.
</p>
<p>
  To nominate someone, go to the <a href="http://sab.ucsc.edu/thumbsup">Thumbs Up web site.</a> Each person may make up to five nominations. Nominators and nominees must be staff employees. Student employees and faculty are not eligible to make or receive Thumbs Up Awards. Nominations must be received by 5 p.m. on December 23.
