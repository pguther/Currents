  Six new IT senior directors will be introduced, and the new IT organization name will be announced at a September 21 <a href="http://its.ucsc.edu/transformation/news_and_events/townhall.php">Town Hall meeting</a>. At press time, the names of all of the new directors had not been announced. But the six will be introduced at the meeting and will address the audience and answer questions. The winner of the organization-naming contest (see earlier <a href="http://currents.ucsc.edu/04-05/08-09/morenews.html#IT">Currents story</a>) will be announced and awarded an iPod.

  IT staff members are especially encouraged to attend the meeting from 2 to 4 p.m. in the Kresge Town Hall Building, but the entire campus community is welcome.
