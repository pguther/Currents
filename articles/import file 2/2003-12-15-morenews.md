  <br>
  Sammy Slug will be on duty at the base of campus December 15-16, weather permitting, to encourage the campus community to contribute cash, checks, or food to the Second Harvest Food Bank. A campus mail truck will be in the Granary parking lot between 7:30 and 9 a.m. both days to accept donations.<br>
</p>
<p>
  <img align="right" height="129" src="../art/second_harvest.jpg" width="176" alt="">The Food Bank provides food to 120 local agencies serving more than 45,000 people every month, 45 percent of whom are children. For every dollar donated, Second Harvest is able to distribute more than $10 worth of food. A $15 cash donation provides over 63 meals to hungry families.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The drive concludes on December 17, when a Metro bus at the base of campus will be loaded with the donations.<br>

  <a name="cosmos" id="cosmos"></a>UC receives $400,000 to expand successful math and science summer school
</p>
<p>
  The University of California has been awarded a $400,000 grant by the Toyota USA Foundation to expand its California State Summer School for Mathematics and Science program (COSMOS) to a fourth UC campus.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The funding will cover 50 percent of the planning costs to establish a new site, and half of the operating costs of the monthlong summer school's first year of operation.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The university has yet to determine which of its campuses will host the new summer school program, which is expected to be in place for students in 2005. Last summer, about 450 high-achieving students entering the 9th to 12th grades took part in COSMOS's residential program at UC Irvine, UC Santa Cruz, and UC Davis.<br>
