  A piece by music professor David Evan Jones, <i>Eemulnori: Memory and Reflection</i> for violin and piano--was selected as one of six winning compositions in the Korean-American Music Composition Competition.
</p>
<p>
  The winning compositions will be used in upcoming performance competitions by young Korean students of classical music. The ultimate goal is to disseminate Korean cultural heritage to younger generations growing up in the United States. Composers are invited to submit original pieces incorporating traditional Korean themes--written for Western musical instruments and suitable for student performers.
</p>
<p>
  Jones is a composer of instrumental, vocal, and electronic music and a theorist writing about relationships between phonetics and music. His first chamber opera, <i>Bardos</i>, was staged in Seoul by the Seoul Contemporary Opera Company in 2004, and he is currently at work on his third opera.
</p>
<p>
  Jones was recently invited to contribute to a festschrift for Korean composer Sung Jae Lee, a professor emeritus of Seoul National University. A festschrift is a complimentary publication, often symbolizing the results of research, which is created in honor of a person on the occasion of an anniversary celebration. In honor of Lee's 80th birthday, Jones composed a musical composition in the shape of the characters of Lee's name.
