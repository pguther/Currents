  A film by Renee Tajima-Pena, associate professor of community studies, has won a CINE Golden Eagle Award in the people and places category of the Professional Telecast Non-Fiction Division. The award will be presented during the 46th annual awards ceremony on April 14.

  Tajima-Pena's film, <i>My Journey Home</i>, debuted on PBS television last year. The two-hour documentary tells the stories of four Americans who travel to their ancestral homelands, featuring writer Faith Adiele, journalist Andrew Lam, and Tajima-Pena's husband and brother-in-law, Armando and Carlos Pena.
