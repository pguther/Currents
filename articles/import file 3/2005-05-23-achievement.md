  "Recognition of the outstanding achievements of our students is one of the ways in which UCSC demonstrates its commitment to excellence in teaching and research," said interim vice provost and dean of undergraduate education William Ladusaw.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The Undergraduate Achievement Awards ceremony is a highlight of the annual celebration showcasing the scholarly and creative activities of UCSC's undergraduate and graduate students, Ladusaw said.

  "It is an opportunity to pay tribute to their success and to honor the commitment of the faculty who so successfully engage students in learning through discovery," he said. Hundreds of students will be honored at the ceremony on Friday, June 3, from 3 to 5 p.m. at the Colleges Nine and Ten Multipurpose Room.<br>
