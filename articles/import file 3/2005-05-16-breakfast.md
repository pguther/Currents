  Chancellor Denice D. Denton underscored her appreciation of university staff at the annual Staff Appreciation Breakfast last week by pledging to continue the special awards program begun four years ago.
</p>
<p>
  Employees will receive a $210 bonus for their "continued dedication and hard work," announced Denton. The award will appear in June 8 checks after "noticing obligations" for represented employees are met, she said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Denton greeted many employees as they arrived at the breakfast, held at the Stevenson Event Center, and she thanked them for their commitment and enthusiasm during brief remarks.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "I really want to thank every one of you for the great work you're doing," said Denton, adding that the university would not be able to fulfill its mission of service to students without the dedication of staff. She acknowledged the "good feedback and ideas" she's received from members of the UCSC Staff Advisory Board (SAB), which sponsors the annual breakfast, and presented each outgoing SAB member with a Chancellor's Service Award.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Denton sparked a round of warm applause for Dining Services staff, who arrived before dawn to prepare the buffet of eggs, tofu scramble, pancakes, potatoes, bacon, sausage, pastries, doughnuts, and fresh fruit. " It's not easy to feed 1,100 people," she said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Dozens of raffle prizes were awarded, including gift certificates to Macy's, Bay Tree Bookstore, Circuit City, O'mei, Trader Joe's, Well Within, Gabriella Cafe, Olitas Cantina &amp; Grille, the Crow's Nest, and Bittersweet Bistro. Many local businesses and campus administrators, including Denton, contributed prizes to the raffle.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The band Split Shift, made up entirely of UCSC employees, performed rock and blues for the crowd, which spilled over to the patio. Three of the five musicians work in Transportation and Parking Services: vocalist Carolyn Stark, drummer Tracy Freeman, and keyboardist David Ford. In addition, Patrick North of the Registrar's Office played bass, and guitarist Bob Oberg of Information Technology Services made his debut with the band, which has been performing at weddings and private parties for about four years.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Funded by the Award and Recognition Program, bonuses will be distributed to employees with career, partial-year career, by-agreement, and limited appointments. Awards will be proportionate to each staffer's appointment percentage time in effect on May 1, 2005. Employees with academic, student, or senior management appointments are excluded.<br>
