  The University of California College Prep program's innovative "cybertutoring" project has been recognized as an outstanding use of technology in higher education.
</p>
<p>
  WCET, formerly the Western Cooperative for Educational Telecommunications, selected CyberTutor from among dozens of nominations for its second annual WCET Outstanding Work (WOW) award. Recipients will receive their awards at WCET's annual conference in San Francisco on November 2-5.

  Through CyberTutor, which employs UC undergraduates as tutors, hundreds of high school students have received immediate online academic assistance in their homework assignments, exam preparation, and college application process.

  WCET advances the effective use of technology in higher education. Each year, the organization recognizes five institutions and higher education systems for their innovative and effective uses of technologies in educating and serving students.

  "WCET members are always on the cutting edge in using educational technologies for instruction both on and off campus," said Sally Johnstone, executive director of the cooperative. "This award recognizes several significant advances and creative uses of technology to assure educational quality and better serve students."
