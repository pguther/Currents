  An effort to move a storage container behind the police station went badly awry on Friday morning when the truck rolled down a steep incline near the main entrance to campus.
</p>
<p>
  The truck turned and came to rest before reaching Coolidge Drive across from the Cook House. There was no driver in the truck when the accident occurred about 10 a.m., police said.
</p>
<p>
  No one was injured in the accident, which drew considerable attention from nearby drivers and pedestrians.
</p>
<p>
  Drip pans were set up quickly at the site to avoid seepage of chemicals, such as transmission fluid, into the soil before the vehicle was towed away.
</p>
<p>
  On its way downhill, the truck struck and destroyed one of the small historic buildings dating to the time before UCSC's arrival, when the land was part of the Cowell Ranch. The building apparently housed at least one skunk, and the area smelled strongly of skunk Friday morning.<br>
