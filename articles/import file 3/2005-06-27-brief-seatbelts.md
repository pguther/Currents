<p>
  Stepped-up enforcement resulted in 134 seat-belt violation citations being written May 16-June 5, campus police reported.
</p>
<p>
  UCSC's officers joined local and state police in the nationwide "Click it or Ticket" campaign administered by the National Highway Traffic Safety campaign.
</p>
<p>
  Surveys were conducted before and after the enhanced enforcement to gauge the impact of the effort. The first survey, conducted on May 11, showed a 92 percent seat belt usage rate, police said. After the campaign, a June 8 survey showed seat belt usage by drivers had risen to 98 percent, police said.

<p>
  Two UCSC police officers, Tony Contreras and Steve Garcia, were nominated for California Office of Traffic Safety awards for their outstanding efforts during the campaign.
