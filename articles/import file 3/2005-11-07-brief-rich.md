  B. Ruby Rich, assistant professor of community studies, attended the Toronto International Film Festival in September. In October, she held a conversation with Palestinian filmmaker Hany Abu-Assad on stage at the Clay Theatre in San Francisco. His film, <i>Paradise Now</i>, seeks to increase understanding of the mindsets of Palestinian suicide bombers. It is being released by Warners Independent, which Rich said shows a "new mainstreaming of this kind of material."
