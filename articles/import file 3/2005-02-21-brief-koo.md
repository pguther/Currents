  <a href="http://www.ucolick.org/%7Ekoo/home.html">David Koo</a>, professor of astronomy and astrophysics, will discuss how astronomers are using telescopes to explore the history of the universe in a lecture at the Science &amp; Engineering Library on Tuesday, March 1. Koo's talk, titled " What is our universe? How large is it? What was the universe like in the past?," will begin at 4 p.m. in the library's Current Periodicals Room. It is part of the library's <a href="http://library.ucsc.edu/science/synergy">Synergy Lecture Series</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Koo will describe an ongoing research project called the Deep Extragalactic Evolutionary Probe (DEEP), in which the giant telescopes at the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii and the Hubble Space Telescope are being used to survey more than 40,000 distant galaxies. Because it takes billions of years for light from distant galaxies to reach the Earth, scientists see these galaxies as they appeared when the universe was young.
</p>
<p>
  The DEEP project is led by UCSC astronomers in collaboration with researchers at UC Berkeley, the University of Hawaii, Johns Hopkins University, the University of Chicago, and the California Institute of Technology.
</p>
<p>
  The Synergy Lecture Series is designed to provide a platform for exchanging ideas and showcasing the exciting research in science and engineering currently in progress at UCSC.
