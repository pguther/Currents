  Join a moonlight kayaking paddle, a day hike from Big Basin State Park to Waddell Creek beach on the north coast, a wine tasting trip in Monterey County, or a backpacking trip to Yosemite. The Recreation Department is offering these and many other outdoor adventures this fall. There are also classes in a wide variety of interest areas, including Thai cooking, meditation, salsa dancing, survival skills, surfing, and guitar. The fall 2005 <i>Recreation, Intramural &amp; Sports Guide</i>, available all over campus, describes the offerings in detail.
