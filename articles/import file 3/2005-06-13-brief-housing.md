  Plans to begin construction on 45 single-family homes at Ranch View Terrace, Phase I, the latest on-campus housing for faculty and staff, were approved May 25 by the UC Board of Regents.
</p>
<p>
  Groundbreaking on the project is expected in middle to late August, with completion scheduled for fall 2006, said Faculty and Staff Housing manager Steve Houser.
</p>
<p>
  The first phase of Ranch View Terrace will be composed of 20 three-bedroom houses and 25 four-bedroom houses. <a href="http://housing.ucsc.edu/housing/rvtbrochure.pdf">Additional details on the project</a> (pdf file).<br>
