  The campus community is invited to attend the annual Lionel Cantu Memorial Colloquium on Tuesday, May 24, at 4 p.m. in the College Eight Red Room. The event will be followed by a reception at 5:30 p.m.
</p>
<p>
  This year's featured guest is Mattie Richardson, a doctoral candidate in African American studies at UC Berkeley. Richardson is the recipient of the UC Office of the President's 2005-06 Lionel Cantu Postdoctoral Fellowship. Her talk is entitled "Listening to the Archives: Black Lesbian Literature and Film."

  The colloquium honors the memory of Cantu, an assistant professor of sociology who died unexpectedly in 2002. At UCSC, the Lionel Cantu Memorial Award Fund was established to support a campus graduate student who is pursuing studies in one or more of the areas in which Cantu worked: immigration studies, transnational/cross-border studies, Latino/Latina sociology, gender and sexuality, or gay men and masculinity. This year's recipient of the $500 award will be announced at the colloquium. The selection committee was made up of sociology professor Candace West, anthropology professor Olga Najera-Ramirez, Latin American and Latino studies professor Patricia Zavella, and sociology graduate student Sarita Gaytan.

  In addition, the gathering will recognize the accomplishments of graduating seniors in sociology, including Jennifer Meissonnier, who was awarded the Dean's Undergraduate Award and a Chancellor's Award for her thesis, and Kara Deyhle, who has received a $10,000 public service award from the Donald A. Strauss Scholarship Foundation.
