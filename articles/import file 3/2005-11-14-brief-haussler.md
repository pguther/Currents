  David Haussler, professor of biomolecular engineering and director of the Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering (CBSE), will speak at the opening session of the 2005 World Technology Summit this week in San Francisco.
</p>
<p>
  Haussler, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator, will discuss health, medicine, and biotechnology. His talk is one of six technology overviews by leaders in various fields on Monday, November 14, the opening day of the summit. Haussler will also take part in a panel discussion of the technology overviews moderated by Adam Lashinsky, senior writer for <i>Fortune</i> magazine.
</p>
<p>
  The two-day summit is organized by the World Technology Network, which brings together individuals and companies deemed by their peers to be the most innovative in the science and technology world. Areas of interest range from information technology and communications to biotech, energy, materials, and space, as well as related fields such as finance, marketing, policy, law, design, and ethics.
</p>
<p>
  The annual World Technology Summit concludes on Tuesday evening with the World Technology Awards. The awards are the culmination of a global judging program through which new members are nominated and selected. Haussler, as one of six finalists in the category of information technology software, is a new fellow of the World Technology Network and is eligible for the award in his category. Winners will be announced at the ceremony Tuesday night.
</p>
<p>
  "This year's group of fellows represent what is imminent, possible, and important in and around emerging technologies," said James P. Clark, founder and chairman of the World Technology Network.
</p>
<p>
  Haussler's genome bioinformatics group at UCSC participates in collaborative efforts to produce, assemble, and annotate the first mammalian genomes. His group designed and built the program that assembled the first working draft of the human genome sequence from information produced by sequencing centers worldwide and helped produce the finished sequence. The group also created the UCSC Genome Browser, a powerful web-based tool for investigating the genome sequences of humans and other organisms. Haussler's ongoing research addresses a range of questions in comparative and evolutionary genomics.
