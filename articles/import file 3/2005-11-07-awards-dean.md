  "Hybridity and its Discontents: Considering Visual Culture in Colonial Spanish America" (<i>Colonial Latin American Review</i> vol. 12., no. 1, pp. 5-35, June 2003), coauthored by UCSC professor of history of art and visual culture Carolyn Dean and Smith College associate professor of art history Dana Leibsohn, has been awarded the Franklin Pease G. Y. Memorial Prize for the best article published in <i>Colonial Latin American Review</i> in 2003 and 2004. This same article also received the 2004 Conference prize for the best article on Latin American history from the AHA Conference on Latin American History.

  The jury for the 2003-04 <i>Colonial Latin American Review</i> prize consisted of three distinguished scholars of colonial Latin America, all members of CLAR's Advisory Board: Mercedes Lopez-Baralt, Universidad de Puerto Rico, Rio Piedras; Stuart B. Schwartz, Yale University; and Eric Van Young, University of California, San Diego. The article was praised as "well written, thoughtful, wide-ranging, and interesting," with one reader observing that in the essay "a winning combination of erudition and theoretical deconstruction humbles the contemporary scholar into accepting the complexity of a reality that will never completely unveil its mysteries." The Pease Prize will be announced in the upcoming (December 2005) issue of the journal.
