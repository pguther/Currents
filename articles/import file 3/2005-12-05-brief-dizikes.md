  John Dizikes, a professor emeritus of American studies, will give this year's Emeriti Faculty Lecture on December 8 in the UCSC Media Theater at 7 p.m. The presentation, which will include music, is free and open to the public.
</p>
<p>
  Dizikes's talk, titled "Nation and Homeland in Nineteenth Century Italian Opera," is about the response of Italian opera composers to the rise of nationalism in 19th-century Italy. The major theme of aspiring to create a unified homeland, found throughout Italian history and opera, will be his focus.
</p>
<p>
  Dizikes's teaching and research interests range from politics to history of the arts. He is the author of numerous books and articles, including <i>Opera in America: A Cultural History</i> (Yale University Press, 1993), which won the 1993 National Book Critics Circle Award for criticism, and <i>Yankee Doodle Dandy: The Life and Times of Tod Sloan</i> (University of Nebraska Press, 2004).
</p>
<p>
  Dizikes came to UCSC in 1965. A winner of the UCSC Alumni Association's Distinguished Teaching Award, Dizikes served as Cowell College provost, and mentored thousands of students during his career at UCSC. He continues to be an active member of the campus community.
