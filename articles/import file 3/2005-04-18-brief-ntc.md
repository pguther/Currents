<p>
  The pace of growth and expansion at the UCSC New Teacher Center will accelerate thanks to a $300,000 grant from the Goldman Sachs Foundation.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The funding will bolster the center's organizational infrastructure and support the rapid growth of the New Teacher Center (NTC), which leads the nation in the development of support programs for new teachers. Since opening in 1998, the NTC has become a national resource for teacher training.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Research shows that teacher quality is the most important variable in student performance, and the NTC provides support during the critical first two years of a new teacher's career. The NTC model pairs beginning teachers with carefully selected veteran teachers, who are trained to become skillful "teachers of teachers." This infusion of support has resulted in substantial decreases in teacher attrition.<br>
</p>
<p>
  NTC works with school districts, universities, policy makers, and educational leaders in more than 30 states to create support systems for new teachers and principals. Services include consultation, professional development, research, program evaluation, and product development.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The Goldman Sachs Foundation awarded grants to several educational organizations that support innovative programs in youth development, business education, and teacher development.
