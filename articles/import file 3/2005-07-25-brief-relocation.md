  During seismic renovation of the Hahn Student Services Building the Financial Aid Office will relocate to Baskin 391A. Office entry will be off the third-floor patio.
</p>
<p>
  The Financial Aid Office will be closed on Tuesday, August 2, and Wednesday, August 3, for the move. Faxes and phones will not be operational those days.
</p>
<p>
  Phone and in-person services will resume on Thursday, August 4. There will be no change in phone or fax numbers or mailing addresses. Paper mail will be automatically delivered to the new location by campus mail services.
</p>
<p>
  The seismic work on Hahn is expected to take approximately a year.
