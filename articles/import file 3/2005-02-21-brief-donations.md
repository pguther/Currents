  Late contributions to the Second Harvest Food Drive have boosted UCSC's final tally to 40,206 pounds, up from the 32,723 pounds presented by campus organizers on December 17, the "official" end of the drive.
</p>
<p>
  Second Harvest Food Bank credits UCSC with three pounds worth of food for every dollar contributed. Second Harvest is a nonprofit organization providing food and basic necessities to people in need. The drive is cosponsored by the Academic Senate and the Staff Advisory Board.

<p>
  Faculty, staff, and students contributed, with many students donating dining hall meals or their dining program "flexi dollars."
