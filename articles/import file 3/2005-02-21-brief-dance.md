  Instructor Isaura Oliveira introduces the dances of the Orixas in a class on Afro-Brazilian dance on February 26, from 1 to 3 p.m. in the Multipurpose Room at the East Field House. The warm-up for the class includes a system of progressive physical conditioning, incorporating yoga asanas for muscles, flexibility, strength, and building self-confidence. The dances selected will be from Baiana cultures, such as Orixas, Samba, and Afoxe, and the special movements from Oliveira's own choreography repertoire.

  Oliveira is a master teacher, choreographer, dancer, actress, costume designer, and artistic director. She holds a B.F.A. in dance performance and has dedicated her career to the dissemination of the wisdom of Afro-Brazilian dance.<br>
