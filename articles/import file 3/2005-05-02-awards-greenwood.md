  Two scholars affiliated with UCSC have been elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (AAAS), one of the most prestigious honors bestowed upon the world's leading scientists, academics, artists, businesspeople, and public leaders.
</p>
<p>
  Former chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood and Michael Soule, professor emeritus of environmental studies, were among the 213 new Fellows and Honorary Members announced last week.
</p>
<p>
  Greenwood, now UC provost and senior vice president of academic affairs, served as chancellor of the UCSC campus from 1996 to 2004. She also holds a UCSC appointment as professor of biology. In her current post, she is UC's highest-ranking woman.
</p>
<p>
  Soule, who joined the UCSC faculty in 1989, has been called "the father of conservation biology." He is a cofounder of the Wildlands Project and the Society for Conservation Biology. Now living in Colorado, Soule has written and edited many books on biology and conservation biology, including <i>Conservation Biology: An Evolutionary-Ecological Perspective</i> with B. A. Wilcox; <i>Conservation and Evolution</i> with O. H. Frankel; <i>Conservation Biology: The Science of Scarcity and Diversity; Viable Populations for Conservation; Research Priorities for Conservation Biology</i> with K. A. Kohm; <i>Reinventing Nature? Responses to Postmodern Deconstruction</i> with Gary Lease, a UCSC professor of history of consciousness; and <i>Continental Conservation: Scientific Foundations of Regional Reserve Networks</i> with John Terborgh.
</p>
<p>
  Soule has conducted pioneering research in various fields, including population and evolutionary biology, population genetics, island biogeography, environmental studies, biodiversity policy, and ethics. His most recent work focuses on the genetic basis of fitness and viability in natural populations, on the impacts of "keystone" species, and on the social causes of the destruction of nature worldwide. He was previously elected a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and he has received a Guggenheim Fellowship, as well as the Archie Carr Medal.
</p>
<p>
  "It gives me great pleasure to welcome these outstanding leaders in their fields in this, the Academy's 225th year," said Academy President Patricia Meyer Spacks. "Fellows are selected through a highly competitive process that recognizes individuals who have made preeminent contributions to their disciplines and to society at large."
</p>
<p>
  Fellows and Foreign Honorary Members are nominated and elected to the Academy by current members. The Academy will welcome this year's new Fellows and Foreign Honorary Members at its annual induction ceremony on October 8 at the Academy's headquarters in Cambridge, Massachusetts.
</p>
<p>
  Founded in 1780, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences is an international learned society composed of the world's leading scientists, scholars, artists, businesspeople, and public leaders.
