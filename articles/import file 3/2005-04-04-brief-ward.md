  Adventure-naturalists Kennan and Karen Ward will show slides and share stories from their recent four-month trip to the Antarctic on April 22 at 7 p.m. at the Rio Theater. The slide show, titled "Antarctica: 100 days in the Wildest Place on Earth," focuses on the extraordinary wildlife and beauty of the Weddell Sea. The massive expanses of tabular ice in this region serve as a barometer to the world for the effects of global warming.

  Proceeds will benefit local members of the California Wild Heritage Campaign as well as the UCSC Recreation Department. CWHC is a broad coalition of conservation groups, businesses, and individuals committed to protecting California's remaining wild public lands and rivers. The current priority of the campaign is to build support for legislation that would protect 300,000 acres of public land on California's north Coast.<br>
