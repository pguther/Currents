<p>
  Daniel Press, a professor of environmental studies, has been reappointed by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger to the Central Coast Regional Water Quality Control Board.
</p>
<p>
  Press, chair of environmental studies, recently completed a partial term to which he was appointed by former governor Gray Davis in 2002. His appointment to a full, four-year term was announced in December. It is a volunteer, part-time appointment.
</p>
<p>
  The Central Coast group is one of nine Regional Water Quality Control Boards that meet every six weeks under the auspices of the State Water Resources Control Board, which oversees water allocation and water quality protection in California.
</p>
<p>
  Regional boards set waste discharge standards, monitor water quality, and take enforcement action against violators.
</p>
<p>
  Regional board members evaluate water quality goals and implementation plans proposed by staff for each jurisdiction, recognizing local differences in climate, topography, geology, and hydrology and balancing factors such as the needs of industry, agriculture, municipal districts, recreation, and the environment.
