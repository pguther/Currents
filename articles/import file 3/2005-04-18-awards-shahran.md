  Morteza Shahram, a graduate student in electrical engineering, was selected as a winner of the student paper contest at a major international conference. Shahram's paper was chosen in the category of Signal Processing Theory and Methods at the 2005 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing, held in Philadelphia last month. (IEEE is the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.)
