</p>
<p>
  UCSC's Interdisciplinary Sciences Building was the site of several coordinated training exercises by campus firefighters and the Santa Cruz Fire Department recently.
</p>
<p>
  The departments come to UCSC to work on rappelling and ladder truck training, said UCSC assistant fire chief Jeff Trapp.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "We get an opportunity to cross train with Santa Cruz firefighters and equipment," he said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  City firefighters brought their ladder engine--with a 104-foot ladder--to the August 5 training session.<br>
</p>
<p>
  UCSC firefighters Phil Kleinheinz and Todd Meyer were among several firefighters rappelling down the side of the Interdisciplinary Sciences Building.
</p>
<p>
  One declining to take part was veteran Paul Babb, who has been with UCSC for 30 years and is retiring this month. Babb just shook his head when asked if he wanted to try it "one last time."<br>
