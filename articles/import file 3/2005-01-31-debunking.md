  Sara Solovitch, a lecturer in UCSC's science writing program, was looking forward to working with a modern-day hero when she drove to San Jose last August for her first meeting with Jumana Mikhail Hanna.
</p>
<p>
  In July 2003, the <i>Washington Post</i> had run a powerful front-page story about Hanna, an Iraqi woman who said she had endured torture and rape in an Iraqi prison in the mid-1990s.
</p>
<p>
  Her harrowing story was cited in Senate testimony by Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz, and Hanna had been granted refugee status and resettled in San Jose.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Solovitch had just signed a contract to coauthor a book with Hanna about her horrific experiences under Saddam Hussein's regime. But Hanna's story soon began to unravel as Solovitch tried to confirm the details. In a lengthy article in the January issue of <i>Esquire</i> magazine, Solovitch describes how she gradually came to the realization that Hanna had fabricated the entire story and fooled everyone from the Pentagon to the <i>Washington Post.</i><br>
</p>
<p>
  Since the publication of Solovitch's <i>Esquire</i> article, the <i>Washington Post</i> has published a report acknowledging that the original story was based on false claims, as well as an article by the <i>Post's</i> ombudsman about the newspaper's investigation of the story. In addition, Solovitch's debunking of the <i>Post</i> story has been covered by the <i>New York Times, Chicago Sun-Times, USA Today,</i> National Public Radio, and other media.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Solovitch, who lives in Santa Cruz and teaches a course on "The Science Profile" for the Science Communication Program, is a freelance magazine writer and former staff writer for the <i>Philadelphia Inquirer.</i> Her stories have appeared in <i>Esquire, Outside, Wired, Omni, Legal Affairs,</i> and other publications, and she has won numerous awards, including the 2002 Outstanding Magazine Article by the American Society of Journalists and Authors.<br>
