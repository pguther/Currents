<p>
  UC employees have a rare opportunity to enroll in the UC-sponsored Supplemental Disability Plan during the annual open enrollment period for health and welfare plans, November 1 through November 30.
</p>
<p>
  The disability plan will be open for new enrollments, and those already enrolled may change their waiting period. No statement of health will be required. The plan has not been open for enrollment in nearly 15 years and is not likely to be open again.
</p>
<p>
  A representative from the supplemental disability insurance company, Liberty Mutual, will be on campus on Thursday, November 3, to make brief presentations regarding the program and to answer questions. There will be two sessions--one from 10:30 to 11 a.m. and another from noon to 12:30 p.m.--in the Bay Tree Conference Center, Room D. Seating is limited, so <a href="http://bas.ucsc.edu/events">sign up online</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The new year will also bring changes in health costs, including changes in copayments and fluctuations in premiums.
