  State senator Jackie Speier (D-San Francisco/San Mateo) spent Friday, April 29, on campus meeting with Chancellor Denton, students, faculty, and members of the senior administration. Speier's visit was part of a listening tour of all the UC campuses that she has undertaken to better understand the impacts of state budget cuts. Speier's meetings on Friday covered a wide range of topics, including enrollment, diversity in faculty hiring, and the ethics of genomics, in addition to the effects of budget cuts on the UCSC campus. She also participated in a roundtable discussion with students, pictured above.
