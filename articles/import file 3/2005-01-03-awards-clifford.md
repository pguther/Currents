  James Clifford, chair of the History of Consciousness Department, was awarded an honorary degree, Doctor of Letters Honoris Causa, by Haverford College at a special academic convocation held on December 4.
</p>
<p>
  Clifford joined the UCSC faculty in 1978. He has effectively utilized the campus's unique interdisciplinary environment to shape a body of work that links history, anthropology, literature, and cultural studies.
</p>
<p>
  The degree citation noted that Clifford has "for three decades challenged and changed the terms of humanistic inquiry as one of his generation's most original cultural interpreters," adding that "noted for its intellectual coherence, conceptual daring, and clarity of expression, his writing has reshaped the field of sociocultural anthropology while enjoying international influence among a wide range of scholars and students concerned to understand the fate of all cultures in the crucible of global modernity."
