  Chancellor Denice D. Denton will be sworn in as UCSC's ninth chancellor as part of a series of fall events that will be short on ceremony and long on substance.
</p>
<p>
  "Instead of spending resources on pomp and circumstance, we will invest in our academic priorities and our students," Chancellor Denton said. "The goal of the investiture period is to create an opportunity to celebrate UC Santa Cruz, advance diversity and excellence, support our students, engage our community partners, and stimulate and herald our future accomplishments."
</p>
<p>
  UC President Robert C. Dynes will participate in a brief ceremony investing Denton as UCSC's chancellor on Friday, November 4, followed immediately by her inaugural address.
</p>
<p>
  A symposium, "Achieving Excellence through Diversity," will take place on Thursday and Friday, November 3 and 4. On Thursday afternoon, Shirley Ann Jackson, 18th president of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, will deliver the keynote address; Jackson will also receive the third annual UCSC Foundation Medal.
</p>
<p>
  On Saturday, November 5, Chancellor Denton will host UCSC's annual Scholarships Benefit Dinner--an event at which it was announced last year that more than $1 million in scholarships and fellowships for students had been raised. At this year's dinner, UCSC benefactor Jack Baskin will receive the foundation's first-ever Fiat Lux Award for service to the campus.
