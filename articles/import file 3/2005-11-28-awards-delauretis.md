  Born and educated in Italy, de Lauretis came to the United States shortly after completing her doctorate in modern languages and literatures at Bocconi University in Milan. Before joining the History of Consciousness Department at UCSC, she taught Italian and comparative literature, semiotics, women's studies, and film studies at several American universities, including the University of Colorado and the University of Wisconsin. She has also held visiting professorships in Canada, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands, as well as the United States.

Her works have been translated into 14 other languages of Western and Eastern Europe, Latin America, and Asia. Her books in English include <i>Alice Doesn't: Feminism, Semiotics, Cinema</i> (1984), <i>Technologies of Gender</i> (1987), <i>The Practice of Love</i> (1994), and three edited or coedited volumes of essays, <i>Feminist Studies/Critical Studies</i> (1986), <i>The Cinematic Apparatus</i> (1980), and <i>The Technological Imagination</i> (1980).
