  Bruce McPherson and his wife, Mary McPherson, are pictured here with the Ansel Adams photo presented to them on behalf of the campus by Acting Chancellor Martin M. Chemers. A plaque on the photo recognizes McPherson's consistent support of higher education issues during his service as a California Assembly Member and State Senator. He left the latter position in December under term limit rules. The presentation was made on December 15 at a reception honoring McPherson.
