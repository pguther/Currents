  Two faculty members of the Baskin School of Engineering have been elected Fellows of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). They are J. J. Garcia-Luna-Aceves, Baskin Professor of Computer Engineering, and Darrell Long, Malavalli Professor of Storage Systems.
</p>
<p>
  The IEEE Board of Directors confers this honor on a select group of recipients with an extraordinary record of accomplishments in designated fields. In electing Garcia-Luna-Aceves and Long as IEEE Fellows, the board cited Garcia-Luna-Aceves's "contributions to theory and design of communication protocols for network routing and channel access" and Long's "contributions to storage systems architecture and performance." Both are recognized internationally as leaders in their respective fields.
</p>
<p>
  Garcia-Luna-Aceves heads the Computer Communication Research Group (CCRG) at UCSC. His current research projects focus on wireless networks and Internetworking, including a $5.2 million collaborative project sponsored by the U.S. Army Research Office to develop a general theory of complex and dynamic wireless communication networks.
</p>
<p>
  Garcia-Luna-Aceves is a principal scientist at the Palo Alto Research Center and was formerly a center director at SRI International, a visiting professor at Sun Microsystems Labs, and a principal of protocol design for Nokia. He received the SRI International Exceptional Achievement Award in 1985 for his work on multimedia communications and again in 1989 for his work on adaptive routing algorithms. He coauthored the book <i>Multimedia Communications: Protocols and Applications</i> (Prentice-Hall, 1998) and has published nine U.S. patents and 300 papers on computer communication.
</p>
<p>
  Garcia-Luna-Aceves earned his B.S. in electrical engineering from the Universidad Iberoamericana in Mexico City and his M.S. and Ph.D. in electrical engineering from the University of Hawaii. He joined the UCSC faculty in 1993.
</p>
<p>
  Long serves as associate dean for research and graduate studies in the Baskin School of Engineering and is director of the Storage Systems Research Center (SSRC), a leading center for research on data storage and storage systems. He also serves on a standing committee of the National Research Council on technology and security issues.
</p>
<p>
  Research in the SSRC focuses on caching, storage systems hierarchies, peta-scale storage systems, distributed storage systems, and security and performance. Long has broad research interests in the area of computing systems, including operating systems, distributed systems, high-performance storage systems, fault tolerance, performance evaluation, and mobile computing. He has received an IBM Faculty Award and several IBM Research Invention Achievement Awards. He has more than 125 research publications and numerous patents related to storage systems.
</p>
<p>
  Long earned his B.S. in computer science from San Diego State University and M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in computer science from UC San Diego. He joined the UCSC faculty in 1988.
