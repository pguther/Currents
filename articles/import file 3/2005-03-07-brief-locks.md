  If your office or building is getting new locks and keys, don't forget about the campus police. The police need to have copies of keys for all campus buildings in case emergency access is required, but sometimes this step is being overlooked.

  Those responsible for key control or making changes to a security alarm in office areas, classrooms, labs, or housing areas on campus should notify the UCSC Police Department prior to rekeying doors or making changes to alarm systems. Key and alarm changes (for current alarm service only) should be directed to Elisabet Hiatt at (831) 459-2897 or <a href="mailto:lazo@ucsc.edu">lazo@ucsc.edu</a>.
