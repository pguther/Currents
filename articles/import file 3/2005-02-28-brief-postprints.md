  The University of California Office of Scholarly Communication has announced the public launch of its new eScholarship postprints service.
</p>
<p>
  Scholars have been increasingly seeking new ways to distribute the results of their research, and postprints--peer-reviewed articles that have been previously published in academic journals--have recently been at the center of this movement to reshape scholarly publishing. The new eScholarship postprints service provides scholars with another option for regaining control of their scholarship and maximizing its availability and influence.
</p>
<p>
  In addition, the academic community and general public gain an unprecedented opportunity to study the published results from the research happening at all UC campuses and research centers. The repository can be accessed free at <a href="http://repositories.cdlib.org/escholarship/about.html">repositories/cdlib.org/escholarship/about.html</a>.
