  Sociology professor John Brown Childs will discuss ways to honor and strengthen the celebration of Black History Month during a free lecture for the campus community at noon on Thursday, February 10, in Room D of the Bay Tree Conference Center.
</p>
<p>
  Childs will discuss intersections among African American history and Native American and Latino histories in the Americas. Those intersections offer ways to enrich Black History Month and honor connections between the populations. Childs, author of <i>Transcommunality: From the Politics of Conversion to the Ethics of Respect,</i> believes greater understanding of the commonalities among African Americans, Native Americans, and Latinos can enhance cooperation.
</p>
<p>
  Childs's talk is part of the Diversity Lecture Series, which continues with two more talks, both of which begin at noon in Room D of the Bay Tree Conference Center.
</p>
<p>
  On March 3, award-winning filmmaker Renee Tajima-Pena, a professor of community studies, will talk about her efforts to document social change and social justice issues in a lecture entitled, "Documenting Social Change, Working for Social Justice." Tajima-Pena's films include <i>Who Killed Vincent Chin?, My America (Or Honk If You Love Buddha)</i>, and the recent PBS series, <i>The New Americans</i>.
</p>
<p>
  On April 7, Catherine Ramirez, a professor of American studies, will discuss "Hidden History: Lady Zoot Suiters."
