<p>
  Six faculty members and 11 graduate teaching assistants who have demonstrated "exemplary and inspiring teaching" have received top honors from the UC Santa Cruz Academic Senate Committee on Teaching and the Graduate Council.
</p>
<p>
  The 2004-05 Excellence in Teaching Awards were presented by Chancellor Denice D. Denton and Committee on Teaching chair Charles McDowell on May 27 at University House.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Nominations for the annual honor are submitted by students. The committee also reads a statement on teaching written by the nominee, as well as a letter from the department chair. The committee looks for evidence that the nominee has thought deeply about teaching and learning, and effectively applies that thinking in the classroom.
</p>
<p>
  Teaching assistant award winners are selected by the Graduate Council from nominations by faculty.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The awards include $500 in cash for faculty members and $200 for graduate students.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Faculty winners, followed by the text on their certificates, are:<br>
