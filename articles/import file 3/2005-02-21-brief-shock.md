  UCSC's Institute for Advanced Feminist Research (IAFR) will present a reading from <i>Shock and Awe: War on Words</i> on Tuesday, March 1, at 7:30 p.m. at Capitola Book Cafe.
</p>
<p>
  Coedited by Bregje van Eekelen, Jennifer Gonzalez, Bettina Stotzer, and Anna Tsing, with Jody Greene as the managing editor, <i>Shock and Awe: War on Words</i> is the first book to be published in the IAFR series, "Feminist Provocations," as well as the first book by New Pacific Press, a venture recently started by David Watson, owner of The Literary Guillotine in Santa Cruz.

<p>
  <i>Shock and Awe: War on Words</i> grew out of the activities of the IAFR's working group, Feminisms and Global War. Its contributors are both local and global. For more information about the book, go to the <a href="http://currents.ucsc.edu/04-05/10-11/words.asp">Currents story</a>.
