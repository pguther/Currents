  Student accomplishments in the Humanities Division will be highlighted on June 1 and 2 at three separate events during UCSC's Student Achievement Week.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Linguistics Undergraduate Research Conference</b>
</p>
<p>
  The Linguistics Undergraduate Research Conference is an annual event that features presentations of the most significant research by students majoring in linguistics or language studies during the current academic year. A large number of linguistics undergraduates, as well as most of the department's graduate students and faculty, attend this conference.<br>
</p>
<p>
  A highlight of the event is a keynote presentation by a graduate with a B.A. in linguistics or language studies from UCSC. This year's keynote speaker is Gina Taranto, who graduated in 1994 with a B.A. in linguistics from Kresge College with honors. She went on to earn a Ph.D. in linguistics at UC San Diego and currently holds the position of discourse analyst/linguist at H5 Technologies in San Francisco.<br>

  The conference will take place on Wednesday, June 1, from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. in the Silverman Conference Room at Stevenson College.<br>
