  Shujaat Husain Khan will perform on sitar with Abhiman Kaushal on tabla on Saturday, January 22, at 7:30 p.m. at the Music Center Recital Hall.<br>
  <br>
  Considered one of the greatest North Indian classical musicians of his generation, Shujaat Husain Khan is the son and disciple of master sitarist Ustad Vilayat Khan. In 2003, Khan performed at Santa Cruz's Rio Theater with the acclaimed Ghazal Ensemble. His style, known as the gayaki ang, is imitative of the subtleties of the human voice.<br>
