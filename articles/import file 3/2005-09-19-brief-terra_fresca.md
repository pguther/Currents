  The restaurant at the University Center has a new name and new management. UC Dining Services took over management from Sodexho in June and renamed the restaurant Terra Fresca to reflect the new emphasis on fresh local foods.
</p>
<p>
  Restaurant staff spent the summer testing the menu, creating a more warm and inviting space, tightening procedures to quicken service time, and training staff, according to Julie Mitravich, head of operations and events at the restaurant.
</p>
<p>
  Terra Fresca is open for lunch Monday through Friday, from 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. Over the summer, while staff were fine tuning the menu and operations, they offered a buffet lunch one day a week. It was so popular that they decided to make it a regular Friday feature this fall.
</p>
<p>
  "The buffet is popular because it is a great value, with a large variety of choices. People can pace their lunch on their own timeline," said Mitravich.
</p>
<p>
  Focusing on fresh, organic, and sustainable foods from Santa Cruz and the Central Coast region, the menu includes a selection of appetizers, soups, salads, sandwiches, entrees, and desserts, along with daily specials and a fresh catch of the day.
</p>
<p>
  Terra Fresca's staff is headed by Mitravich and chef Greg Kuhn. The staff also includes sous chef Chris Wenger, line/pastry cooks Luis Fernando and Doug George, busser/dishwasher Miguel Cisneros, and daily operations coordinator Josh Martin.
