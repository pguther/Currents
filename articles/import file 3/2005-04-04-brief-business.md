<p>
  A forum on the Business Transformation process, which will consolidate 26 service centers into one, will be held from 10:30 a.m. to noon on Wednesday, April 13, at the Music Center Recital Hall.
</p>
<p>
  Campus controller Kirk Lew will provide an overview of the process, and the five project managers will give updates. The event will include time for questions and answers.
</p>
<p>
  Sponsored by the Staff Advisory Board and the Business Transformation Program, the forum is designed to let the campus community know how the consolidation will affect everything from travel reimbursements to purchasing and staff hiring.
