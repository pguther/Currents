  Assistant professor of art Lewis Watts was given an Outstanding Alumni Award by the College of Environmental Design at UC Berkeley, and he presented the commencement speech to that college at the Greek Theater in May of 2005. The award is given to recognize exceptional achievements by alumni in professional, social, academic, artistic, or other areas with a local, national, or international impact.

  Watts's speech to the graduates covered his experience and influence as a student and teacher in the College of Environmental Design and at Berkeley for over 25 years before coming to UC Santa Cruz in 2001.
