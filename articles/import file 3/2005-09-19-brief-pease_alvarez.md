  Lucinda Pease-Alvarez, an associate professor of education at UCSC, is one of 17 educators around the country named to an innovative project that will develop a "virtual apprenticeship" for novice teachers.
</p>
<p>
  The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching has selected Pease-Alvarez and 16 others as the first Goldman-Carnegie Quest Fellows, charged with developing new tools for teaching. The fellows will document the work of accomplished classroom teachers and showcase their practice in multimedia products that will help student teachers learn from veteran teachers. Pease-Alvarez and her peers will integrate these new materials into their courses as alternative texts and materials.
</p>
<p>
  By documenting the work of classroom teachers and teacher educators like Pease-Alvarez, the Quest Project is committed to making the practice of K-12 teaching--and the preparation of novice teachers--public. Multimedia materials will help students connect theory and practice, and understand the hard work that goes into making good teaching look easy.
</p>
<p>
  Materials gathered by Pease-Alvarez and other fellows will be evaluated by the Carnegie Foundation, which will develop an interactive gallery and library archive. Educators will be able to follow individual cases from the originating K-12 classroom, through their use in colleges and university professional schools, and ultimately to their application in the classrooms of new teachers.
</p>
<p>
  Joining Pease-Alvarez as Goldman-Carnegie Quest Fellows are teacher educators affiliated with Stanford University, UC Berkeley, Mills College, San Jose State University, Sonoma State University, Brandeis University, City College of New York, the University of Pennsylvania, and Teachers College, Columbia University.
</p>
<p>
  The Quest Project is supported jointly by $3 million from the Richard and Rhoda Goldman Fund and the Carnegie Foundation. The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, located in Stanford, California, is an independent policy and research center dedicated to doing "all things necessary to encourage, uphold, and dignify the profession of the teacher and the cause of higher education." The Richard and Rhoda Goldman Fund is a private, charitable, family foundation that supports nonprofit organizations that enhance the quality of life, primarily in the San Francisco Bay Area.
