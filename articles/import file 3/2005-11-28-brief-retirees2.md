  All UCSC retirees--and those planning to retire--are invited to the UCSC Retirees Association annual holiday event December 6, at the Aboretum Horticultural Hall.
</p>
<p>
  The group will gather at 11:30 a.m. and have a potuck lunch buffet at noon. Audrey Stanley, professor of theater arts emerita and cofounder of Shakespeare Santa Cruz, will read the holiday classic <i>A Child's Christmas in Wales</i> by Dylan Thomas. For more information on the event, call Cathe Harris at (831) 423-7422.
</p>
<p>
  The UCSC Retirees Association has begun a campaign to inform and actively recruit retired staff members, including those about to retire. Founded in 1988, the UCSC Retirees Association holds quarterly social events and is represented in the systemwide Council of University of California Retirees Associations. The council's goal is advocacy for retirees' interests, especially health insurance and pension benefits.
</p>
<p>
  Monthly board meetings are open to all. For more information, contact the membership chair, Mary Kay DelBianco, at (831) 438-3899.
