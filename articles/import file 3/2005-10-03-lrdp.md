<p>
  As part of the LRDP process, UCSC is planning to release the Draft 2005 LRDP Environmental Impact Report (EIR) in mid-October for public review. The Draft EIR will assess the potential environmental effects related to the implementation of the Draft 2005 LRDP.
</p>
<p>
  To date, UCSC has hosted five public LRDP meetings and three public EIR "scoping" sessions. But there is still time to participate.
</p>
<p>
  Two public hearings will take place during the public comment period, permitting people to submit oral or written comments in person. Written comments may be submitted at any time during the 60-day public comment period.
</p>
<p>
  For more information on ways to review the Draft 2005 LRDP and the accompanying Draft EIR, and for information on the public meetings and instructions on how to submit comments, please go to the <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/lrdp/">LRDP web site.</a><br>
