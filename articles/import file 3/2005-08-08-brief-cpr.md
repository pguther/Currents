  The UCSC Fire Department is offering one-day American Red Cross CPR/First Aid, infant CPR, and AED (automated external defibrillator) classes in English or Spanish. These are great skills to have and could save a life.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Classes with openings are as follows:<br>
  * Wednesday, August 10, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.<br>
  * Thursday, August 18, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.<br>
  * Saturday, September 24, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.<br>
  Additional class dates and times will be offered depending on class requests and scheduling.

  The cost is $40 per person, payable by cash or check (made out to UC Regents). Recharges will be sent from the Fire Department at the conclusion of the class. Certificates from the Red Cross will be mailed out approximately two weeks after class completion.<br>
