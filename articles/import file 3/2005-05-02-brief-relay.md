<p>
  Walkers, joggers, skippers, hoppers, and/or runners are welcome to try to predict their teams' collective times at the 18th Annual Prediction Walk/Run relay race on Tuesday, May 17, from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m.
</p>
<p>
  The lighthearted competition involves four-member relay teams traveling two miles (one-half mile per person) around the East Field track. Participants do not have to walk or run fast to win the event--the closest actual time to the predicted time wins.
</p>
<p>
  Participants will all receive free t-shirts, and multiple prizes will be awarded, including one for best baton. While the emphasis is on fun, the event also has a serious side, with wellness activities and health information as well as refreshments offered. The event is open to all staff and faculty members.
</p>
<p>
