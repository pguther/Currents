        <title>Manganese exposure may speed the emergence of Parkinson's disease symptoms</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 11 Dec 2000 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  A new study suggests that too much manganese, an essential element required by the body in tiny amounts but toxic at elevated levels, may contribute to the early development of Parkinson's disease symptoms in susceptible people. Recent epidemiological studies have suggested an association between Parkinson's disease and elevated exposure to manganese. The new study in animals shows that exposure to low levels of manganese does not directly contribute to the disease, but affects a different part of the brain in a way that exacerbates the effects of Parkinson's. UCSC researchers evaluated the effects of low-level exposure to manganese using rats with a condition that mimics pre-Parkinsonism, an early stage of the disease in which no symptoms are apparent. Their findings were published in the current issue of the scientific journal <i>Neurotoxicology and Teratology.</i> The study highlights the importance of looking at the effects of toxic substances on sensitive subsets of the population who may be most vulnerable, said Donald Smith, an associate professor of environmental toxicology and a coauthor of the paper. "We are concerned about how chronic low-level exposures to toxic substances may accelerate the emergence of neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's," Smith said. The possibility that people in the early stages of Parkinsonism could be especially sensitive to moderately increased levels of manganese is disturbing for several reasons, he said. Manganese is ubiquitous in the environment, and its increasing use in industrial processes may cause some people to take in greater amounts from water, food, and airborne sources. In addition, increased exposure to airborne manganese could result from the use of the manganese compound MMT as a gasoline additive. MMT gained approval for use in the U.S. after its manufacturer, Ethyl Corporation, sued the Environmental Protection Agency and won. Currently, none of the major oil refineries are using MMT, but that could change, Smith noted. "We need better information about the potential risk to sensitive populations when we make decisions about things like MMT," Smith said. Parkinson's disease and manganese toxicity seem to affect different parts of the neurological pathway involved in muscle control, he said. In Parkinson's disease, loss of brain cells in a region called the substantia nigra results in reduced production of dopamine, a chemical involved in communication between nerve cells. The substantia nigra is part of the basal ganglia, the brain region responsible for fine-muscle control. Other parts of the basal ganglia, including the striatum and globus plallidus, are the targets of manganese toxicity. "If two areas in the same pathway are weakened, you get an additive impact, and that's what we believe occurred in this experiment," Smith said. In the experiment, rats were treated with a substance toxic to dopamine-producing nerve cells to induce a pre-Parkinson's condition. The treatment moderately reduced dopamine levels in the substantia nigra region of the rats' brains, but did not cause symptoms detectable in a battery of tests. This created a condition of pre-Parkinsonism mimicking the early neurodegenerative state in the progression of Parkinson's disease. Treated and untreated rats were then given low doses of manganese. The manganese had no effect on dopamine levels in the substantia nigra, but caused significant impairment of neurologic functions. Furthermore, some of the neurologic effects of manganese were more pronounced in the rats with pre-Parkinsonism. The toxic effects of manganese have long been known from studies of miners, steelworkers, and others with high occupational exposures. Chronic overexposure to manganese can lead to a disease known as manganism with symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease. But lower doses of manganese that can cause more subtle health effects are not well known, said Roberto Gwiazda, a research toxicologist and coauthor of the study. In the new study, rats showed impaired muscle control at manganese doses much lower than those used in previously published animal studies of manganese toxicity. But Gwiazda cautioned that the exposure regimen and route (a series of injections) were not comparable to typical environmental exposures in humans. Smith and his coworkers are currently conducting follow-up studies to determine the effects of different doses of manganese and to better understand the mechanisms underlying those effects. In addition to Smith and Gwiazda, the paper is coauthored by Ryan Witholt, who worked on the project as a UCSC undergraduate researcher.

<p>
  , UCSC;Bill Gordon, UCSF; and Catherine Zandonella, UCB
</p>UC Santa Cruz will play a key role in one of three new <a href="http://www.ucop.edu/california-institutes/">California Institutes for Science and Innovation</a> established today (December 7) by Governor Gray Davis. The Institute for Bioengineering, Biotechnology and Quantitative Biomedical Research (QB3) will be centered at UC San Francisco with major research components at UC Santa Cruz and UC Berkeley.<br>
<br>
The institute promises to lead the next revolution in biomedical research. It will integrate physical, mathematical, and engineering sciences to create powerful new techniques for attacking biological problems of such enormous complexity that they have simply remained unapproachable--until now. This integration of sciences could open the way for discovery of treatments and cures for some of our most intractable diseases, such as brain disorders, cancer, and diabetes.<br>
<br>
UC Santa Cruz is also a partner in a fourth institute that Gov. Davis said he would urge the state legislature to fund next year. (See Governor Davis's <a href="http://www.governor.ca.gov/briefing/pressreleases/dec00/pr00325127.html">press release</a>.) The <a href="http://www.citris.berkeley.edu">Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society</a> (CITRIS) will be headquartered at UC Berkeley, with partners at UCSC, UC Davis, and UC Merced.<br>
<br>
The <a href="http://pubaffairs.ucsf.edu/qb3/">QB3 institute</a> will foster new technology and collaborations for projects such as development of artificial tissues that mimic those found in the human body, to be used to make replacement blood vessels, bone implants, and synthetic replacement organs. Better imaging techniques and computer-assisted analysis developed at the institute will improve the detection and treatment of diseases such as prostate and breast cancer.<br>
<br>
Another focus will be bioinformatics--computing methods to sift through the volumes of data generated by the human genome project and other new developments in biomedical research. Bioinformatics includes techniques that may allow scientists to do experiments on computers rather than in the lab. The institute's bioinformatics program will be based at UC Santa Cruz.<br>
<br>
"The sequencing of the human genome and other advances in molecular genetics have ushered in an exciting and promising new era in biomedical research," said UCSC Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood. "Through creative interdisciplinary collaborations, this institute will deliver new discoveries, new products, and new technologies for the benefit of human health, and we are very pleased that some of the research strengths of UC Santa Cruz will contribute."<br>
<br>
Each of the three partner campuses brings unique strengths to the institute. UCSF is a world-wide leader in biomedical research, with strong programs in both fundamental biological research and in research directly related to disease. UCSC is internationally recognized as a leader in the mathematical and computer sciences related to genomics. And UC Berkeley will provide expertise in both the biological sciences and in analytical fields including physics, chemistry, engineering, and computer science.<br>
<br>
"This institute will represent an unprecedented collaboration among the three campuses, breaking down the traditional boundaries of scientific disciplines. The result should be a greatly enhanced understanding of the human organism, new approaches to the prevention and treatment of disease, and powerful stimuli to the economy of California," said UCSF Chancellor J. Michael Bishop.<br>
<br>
UC Berkeley Chancellor Robert M. Berdahl said, "Tackling today's most challenging health problems requires scientists and scholars from many fields building upon one another's expertise. This institute does just that. Equally important, it will help us to train students to excel in this new way of doing health science research."<br>
<br>
Organized around three research and education modules--Bioengineering and Biotechnology, Structural and Chemical Biology, and Bioinformatics and the Analysis of Complex Biological Systems--the institute will focus on developing techniques for storing and analyzing vast quantities of biological information and using imaging and mathematical modeling to view molecules, cells, and single organ systems as parts of functional networks. These technologies will allow scientists to understand interactions and predict outcomes and to reconstruct parts of living systems in the laboratory to improve human health.<br>
<br>
The sequencing of the human genome is one of several major advances that are revolutionizing biomedical research. Genome sequencing and other "high-throughput" investigative techniques, such as DNA "chips" or microarrays, are enabling scientists to gather enormous amounts of data on gene regulation, protein interactions, and other aspects of the intricate biomolecular ballet that makes life possible.<br>
<br>
These powerful techniques, however, present major computational challenges because they generate such large and complex datasets. The field of bioinformatics has emerged to meet those challenges, applying advanced information technology to complex problems in biology. QB3's Bioinformatics module will provide the mathematical and computational expertise essential for much of the institute's work.<br>
<br>
"As experimental methods become more sophisticated and the amount of data skyrockets, the role for bioinformatics is dramatically expanding," said David Haussler, professor of computer science and director of the Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering at UC Santa Cruz.<br>
<br>
Haussler, who holds a UC Presidential Chair and is a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator, is a codirector of the institute. He and his colleagues at UCSC have played a key role in the Human Genome Project, assembling the first publicly available working draft of the human genome sequence. They have also designed a web-based human genome browser that investigators can use to view genes and regions of interest on the assembled genome together with related information in other databases. The <a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu">web site</a> has drawn the attention of biomedical researchers worldwide. On a typical day, the site receives more than 10,000 requests for information. Researchers are using it to find genes that may someday lead to new treatments for disease.<br>
<br>
The use of human genomics in the development of new drugs and new diagnostic tools will undoubtedly require new computational methodologies. The institute will provide unique opportunities for collaborative efforts in these areas, Haussler said.<br>
<br>
"Bioinformatics has applications ranging from basic molecular biology to clinical diagnostics and medical imaging. Through the institute, top researchers in all these areas from the three UC campuses will join forces to develop novel technologies for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases," Haussler said.<br>
<br>
QB3 will occupy 90,000 square feet of the first building at the new UCSF Mission Bay campus, now under construction about a mile south of San Francisco's Financial District. The 43-acre teaching and research campus is expected to attract one of the nation's most important concentrations of biotechnology and life sciences companies to a private research and development zone surrounding the site. The UCSF buildings will house the Instituteis Bioengineering and Biotechnology module and will include a High-field Magnetic Resonance Imaging system that will be the most powerful in the state and promises to serve as a unique regional resource.<br>
<br>
The institute's multidisciplinary approach to health science also complements UC Berkeley's ambitious $500 million Health Sciences Initiative, which seeks to advance health science research through collaboration. The Berkeley campus plans to use QB3 funding to build a new research facility, the first building on campus dedicated to multidisciplinary health sciences research.<br>
<br>
At UC Santa Cruz, the Institute's Bioinformatics and Analysis of Complex Biological Systems module will be housed in 11,250 square feet of a new Physical Sciences Building, scheduled for completion in 2002, and in the Baskin Engineering Building.<br>
<br>
"Promising advances that will benefit human health in ways we can only imagine today, the QB3 Institute will generate new breakthroughs in science, and will also contribute dramatically to the 21st-century economy. The bioinformatics research strengths of UC Santa Cruz provide a unique and integral element for the new institute," said Gordon Ringold, CEO of Surromed and a UCSC alumnus.<br>
<br>
David Agard, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator and UCSF professor of biochemistry and biophysics, will direct the institute, and the codirectors will be Haussler and Graham R. Fleming, UC Berkeley professor of chemistry and director of the Physical Bioscience Division at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.<br>
<br>
As one of three UC institutes selected by the Governor, QB3 will receive state funds totaling $100 million across the three campuses. For every dollar from the state, the institute will provide $2 of outside funding, mainly from private donors.<br>
<br>
CITRIS, the fourth institute which Gov. Davis hopes will be funded next year, aims to bring the benefits of information technology to challenging problems in areas such as transportation, education, emergency preparedness, and health care.<br>
<br>
"This project is about solving society's most challenging problems, about improving the quality of people's lives," said UC Berkeley Chancellor Berdahl.<br>
<br>
"There will be a lot of very interesting technology springing out of CITRIS that will benefit all areas of society," added Richard A. Newton, dean of the UC Berkeley College of Engineering and a professor of electrical engineering and computer sciences.<br>
<br>
A small-scale prototype of one type of system envisioned by CITRIS was developed at UCSC. The Real-time Environmental Information Network and Analysis System (REINAS) gathers data on the Monterey Bay coastal environment from an extensive network of remote sensors, stores it in a distributed database, and displays data on command via powerful graphics techniques. With REINAS, weather forecasters and environmental scientists can observe, monitor, and analyze regional oceanographic and meteorological phenomena in real time from their desktops.<br>
<br>
Systems based on the REINAS model have a wide range of potential applications, said Patrick Mantey, dean of UCSC's Baskin School of Engineering, who directs the REINAS project.<br>
<br>
"In this case it's environmental conditions in Monterey Bay, but it could just as well be traffic patterns or earthquake information," Mantey said.<br>
<br>
In addition to UCSC researchers, REINAS also involves scientists at the Naval Postgraduate School and the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute.<br>
<br>
Business and private donors have pledged CITRIS more than $173 million over four years, including nearly $50 million from industry and $124.5 million in individual donations. Along with the $100 million from the state and an expected $83 million in private and federal research grants and contracts, CITRIS would receive total funding of more than $356 million over four years. Among the 13 corporate sponsors are Intel Corp., Microsoft Corp., Nortel Networks Corp., and Sun Microsystems, Inc.

<p>
  The UCSC Farm regularly hosts visitors from all around the world, from academics to home gardeners. But the group that showed up on December 6 from the Culinary Institute of America was uniquely popular among staff of the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems (CASFS).
</p>Twenty-five students from the institute's Hyde Park campus in New York toured the Farm as part of their education about sustainable agriculture and food-production issues. The visit was one stop during their four-week field trip in California, and it ended with preparation of a luscious six-course meal they shared with CASFS faculty and staff.
<p>
  The buffet was impressive, overflowing with pork ribs; chicken with garlic sauce; roasted squash; braised Asian greens; potato salad with an apple, bacon, and mustard vinaigrette; and a mixed-green salad with pear, walnut, and blue cheese dressing. Not enough? Don't forget the dessert: persimmon bread pudding with whipped cream.
</p>
<p>
  "The potatoes were my favorite," said Farm manager Jim Leap. "I don't know what it was, but it was delicious."
</p>
<p>
  "The dessert was <i>sooo</i> good," said CASFS senior editor Martha Brown.
</p>
<p>
  "It was awesome," said John Fisher, CASFS outreach coordinator. "The food was good, but what's really great is that we expose them to quality food production, and they expose us to quality food preparation. The visit makes that connection vivid for everyone."
</p>
<p>
  The kitchen was a scene of organized chaos in the final moments of cooking, with white-jacketed students and instructors tasting, stirring, pouring, and heaping piles of food on platters.
</p>
<p>
  Hovering over a steaming pot, student chef Peter Kielec said the Farm tour was a great stop on their trip, which has included five cities and visits to wineries, farms, and even the Jelly Belly factory.
</p>
<p>
  "Anything having to do with food, we're learning about," said Kielec, a junior in the Culinary Institute's restaurant-management program. "We're totally into sustainable agriculture and organic foods--making sure there's earth to grow the food we feed everybody."
</p>
<p>
  The group's previous stops included an introduction at UC Davis to genetically modified organisms, which advocates say are necessary to feed an expanding world population.
</p>
<p>
  "After they saw our Farm and heard about our work, the students were shaking my hand and saying how refreshing our work is," said Fisher. "It was gratifying. The Culinary Institute definitely sees the value of exposing their students to organic farming."
</p>
<p>
  Although the institute brings student groups to the Farm twice yearly, this trip marked the first time the aspiring chefs got to cook.
</p>
<p>
  "We hope to continue with the cooking," said Fisher, who added that some Culinary Institute graduates have been inspired to enroll in the Farm's organic farming apprenticeship program after their visit.

<p>
  <br>
  Thanks to an inspired engineer-turned-artist, what could have been a routine class assignment has instead produced a lasting piece of elegant public art for the Life Lab Science Program's Garden Classroom at the UCSC Farm.<br>
  <br>
</p>The "History Tree" project, as conceived by 20-year-old sophomore Evan Holm, honors the passage of time and the cycles of nature while providing visitors with a place to meet, rest, learn, and reflect. The project is the culmination of a class assignment given by Nobuho (Nobi) Nagasawa, an associate professor of art who taught a fall-quarter public art class titled <i>Site Works-- Four-Dimensional Approaches.</i>
<p>
  In collaboration with Life Lab, Nagasawa assigned her students the task of designing a work of art for the garden. A five-member jury heard the proposals and selected Holm's project for construction.
</p>
<p>
  The handcrafted circular concrete bench, 16 feet in diameter, will be permanently installed next spring around the seedling of a native oak tree. Carved in the bench surface, three concentric circles mark--from the center outward--the 300-year life span of the oak tree, the four seasons of nature, and the days of a single year.
</p>
<p>
  The bench--made up of eight 400-pound arcs of cast concrete and brass--is designed to be educational as well as beautiful. The surface has been adorned with brass compass points, a children's recipe for Native American acorn mush (complete with an indentation for pounding acorns), an explanation of photosynthesis, an Ohlone poem, and whimsical elements such as pennies and smooth, colorful glass shards that accent the bench.
</p>
<p>
  An integral part of the project is the oak seedling, the slow growth of which inspired Holm to encourage visitors to reflect on history and the future.
</p>"The project won't be finished until the tree is grown," said Holm. "I'm not going to see it. I'm going to be dead. But I wanted people to look farther into the future and farther into the past."
<p>
  The new children's garden, funded in part by the Packard Foundation, is slated to begin construction early in 2001. Erika Perloff, education coordinator for the Garden Classroom, initially approached Nagasawa, asking if she would design a piece for the garden. It was Nagasawa who suggested making it a public art competition for the students.
</p>
<p>
  During the design process, students had to consider the needs stipulated by Life Lab, including that the artwork be educational, vandalproof, and safe.
</p>
<p>
  With $500 from Life Lab and a $500 Irwin Project Grant that Holm secured himself with Art Department assistance, Holm worked tirelessly to see the project through. Members of the class pitched in, too, and Nagasawa stayed until 5 a.m. to oversee construction on the day before Open Studios on campus. Even Holm's parents, who visited from Seattle over Thanksgiving, were "put to work."
</p>
<p>
  One of the great strengths of the bench, currently in a temporary location outside the Life Lab offices at the UCSC Farm, is that it embodies the best aspect of "functional public art by engaging the public at a very human level with cultural references," said Nagasawa.
</p>
<p>
  "The concept of this project was very strong," she said. "It will enhance the experience of visiting the garden and provide an educational narrative while acknowledging and reinforcing ecological awareness. The work is not just an 'aesthetic object' created for a physical site, but a symbolic connector that will play an integral role in Life Lab's new children's garden, providing a vital link to the past and to the future."
</p>
<p>
  The underlying theme of time, which will be reinforced by the growth of the tree, gives the piece a "four-dimensional quality," Nagasawa added. The outside ring of the bench is made up of small brass plaques, on which each farmer caretaker will annually engrave a significant event that took place during the previous 12 months. Holm and his classmates participated by creating "hypothetical history," engraving a number of plates with their own speculations, including the election of the first woman president in 2008, the birth of "The United Nation of Earth" in 2150, and the abolition of global nuclear testing in 2320.
</p>
<p>
  "As people add their words as the years go by, it will become a growing public art," said Nagasawa. In addition, the Life Lab staff will mark the passage of time by hammering a small brass peg in the innermost ring of the bench.
</p>
<p>
  Gail Thomson, project director of Life Lab's Garden Classroom, is thrilled by the bench, which she said far exceeded her expectations. Indeed, her sentiment is shared by all members of the five-member jury, which included the two landscape architects from the office of Joni Janecki and Associates, who designed the Garden Classroom.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  , UCSC;Bill Gordon, UCSF; and Catherine Zandonella, UCB UC Santa Cruz will play a key role in one of three new <a href="http://www.ucop.edu/california-institutes/">California Institutes for Science and Innovation</a> established today (December 7) by Governor Gray Davis. The Institute for Bioengineering, Biotechnology and Quantitative Biomedical Research (QB3) will be centered at UC San Francisco with major research components at UC Santa Cruz and UC Berkeley. The institute promises to lead the next revolution in biomedical research. It will integrate physical, mathematical, and engineering sciences to create powerful new techniques for attacking biological problems of such enormous complexity that they have simply remained unapproachable--until now. This integration of sciences could open the way for discovery of treatments and cures for some of our most intractable diseases, such as brain disorders, cancer, and diabetes. UC Santa Cruz is also a partner in a fourth institute that Gov. Davis said he would urge the state legislature to fund next year. (See Governor Davis's <a href="http://www.governor.ca.gov/briefing/pressreleases/dec00/pr00325127.html">press release</a>.) The <a href="http://www.citris.berkeley.edu">Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society</a> (CITRIS) will be headquartered at UC Berkeley, with partners at UCSC, UC Davis, and UC Merced. The <a href="http://pubaffairs.ucsf.edu/qb3/">QB3 institute</a> will foster new technology and collaborations for projects such as development of artificial tissues that mimic those found in the human body, to be used to make replacement blood vessels, bone implants, and synthetic replacement organs. Better imaging techniques and computer-assisted analysis developed at the institute will improve the detection and treatment of diseases such as prostate and breast cancer. Another focus will be bioinformatics--computing methods to sift through the volumes of data generated by the human genome project and other new developments in biomedical research. Bioinformatics includes techniques that may allow scientists to do experiments on computers rather than in the lab. The institute's bioinformatics program will be based at UC Santa Cruz. "The sequencing of the human genome and other advances in molecular genetics have ushered in an exciting and promising new era in biomedical research," said UCSC Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood. "Through creative interdisciplinary collaborations, this institute will deliver new discoveries, new products, and new technologies for the benefit of human health, and we are very pleased that some of the research strengths of UC Santa Cruz will contribute." Each of the three partner campuses brings unique strengths to the institute. UCSF is a world-wide leader in biomedical research, with strong programs in both fundamental biological research and in research directly related to disease. UCSC is internationally recognized as a leader in the mathematical and computer sciences related to genomics. And UC Berkeley will provide expertise in both the biological sciences and in analytical fields including physics, chemistry, engineering, and computer science. "This institute will represent an unprecedented collaboration among the three campuses, breaking down the traditional boundaries of scientific disciplines. The result should be a greatly enhanced understanding of the human organism, new approaches to the prevention and treatment of disease, and powerful stimuli to the economy of California," said UCSF Chancellor J. Michael Bishop. UC Berkeley Chancellor Robert M. Berdahl said, "Tackling today's most challenging health problems requires scientists and scholars from many fields building upon one another's expertise. This institute does just that. Equally important, it will help us to train students to excel in this new way of doing health science research." Organized around three research and education modules--Bioengineering and Biotechnology, Structural and Chemical Biology, and Bioinformatics and the Analysis of Complex Biological Systems--the institute will focus on developing techniques for storing and analyzing vast quantities of biological information and using imaging and mathematical modeling to view molecules, cells, and single organ systems as parts of functional networks. These technologies will allow scientists to understand interactions and predict outcomes and to reconstruct parts of living systems in the laboratory to improve human health. The sequencing of the human genome is one of several major advances that are revolutionizing biomedical research. Genome sequencing and other "high-throughput" investigative techniques, such as DNA "chips" or microarrays, are enabling scientists to gather enormous amounts of data on gene regulation, protein interactions, and other aspects of the intricate biomolecular ballet that makes life possible. These powerful techniques, however, present major computational challenges because they generate such large and complex datasets. The field of bioinformatics has emerged to meet those challenges, applying advanced information technology to complex problems in biology. QB3's Bioinformatics module will provide the mathematical and computational expertise essential for much of the institute's work. "As experimental methods become more sophisticated and the amount of data skyrockets, the role for bioinformatics is dramatically expanding," said David Haussler, professor of computer science and director of the Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering at UC Santa Cruz. Haussler, who holds a UC Presidential Chair and is a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator, is a codirector of the institute. He and his colleagues at UCSC have played a key role in the Human Genome Project, assembling the first publicly available working draft of the human genome sequence. They have also designed a web-based human genome browser that investigators can use to view genes and regions of interest on the assembled genome together with related information in other databases. The <a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu">web site</a> has drawn the attention of biomedical researchers worldwide. On a typical day, the site receives more than 10,000 requests for information. Researchers are using it to find genes that may someday lead to new treatments for disease. The use of human genomics in the development of new drugs and new diagnostic tools will undoubtedly require new computational methodologies. The institute will provide unique opportunities for collaborative efforts in these areas, Haussler said. "Bioinformatics has applications ranging from basic molecular biology to clinical diagnostics and medical imaging. Through the institute, top researchers in all these areas from the three UC campuses will join forces to develop novel technologies for the diagnosis and treatment of diseases," Haussler said. QB3 will occupy 90,000 square feet of the first building at the new UCSF Mission Bay campus, now under construction about a mile south of San Francisco's Financial District. The 43-acre teaching and research campus is expected to attract one of the nation's most important concentrations of biotechnology and life sciences companies to a private research and development zone surrounding the site. The UCSF buildings will house the Instituteis Bioengineering and Biotechnology module and will include a High-field Magnetic Resonance Imaging system that will be the most powerful in the state and promises to serve as a unique regional resource. The institute's multidisciplinary approach to health science also complements UC Berkeley's ambitious $500 million Health Sciences Initiative, which seeks to advance health science research through collaboration. The Berkeley campus plans to use QB3 funding to build a new research facility, the first building on campus dedicated to multidisciplinary health sciences research. At UC Santa Cruz, the Institute's Bioinformatics and Analysis of Complex Biological Systems module will be housed in 11,250 square feet of a new Physical Sciences Building, scheduled for completion in 2002, and in the Baskin Engineering Building. "Promising advances that will benefit human health in ways we can only imagine today, the QB3 Institute will generate new breakthroughs in science, and will also contribute dramatically to the 21st-century economy. The bioinformatics research strengths of UC Santa Cruz provide a unique and integral element for the new institute," said Gordon Ringold, CEO of Surromed and a UCSC alumnus. David Agard, a Howard Hughes Medical Institute Investigator and UCSF professor of biochemistry and biophysics, will direct the institute, and the codirectors will be Haussler and Graham R. Fleming, UC Berkeley professor of chemistry and director of the Physical Bioscience Division at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. As one of three UC institutes selected by the Governor, QB3 will receive state funds totaling $100 million across the three campuses. For every dollar from the state, the institute will provide $2 of outside funding, mainly from private donors. CITRIS, the fourth institute which Gov. Davis hopes will be funded next year, aims to bring the benefits of information technology to challenging problems in areas such as transportation, education, emergency preparedness, and health care. "This project is about solving society's most challenging problems, about improving the quality of people's lives," said UC Berkeley Chancellor Berdahl. "There will be a lot of very interesting technology springing out of CITRIS that will benefit all areas of society," added Richard A. Newton, dean of the UC Berkeley College of Engineering and a professor of electrical engineering and computer sciences. A small-scale prototype of one type of system envisioned by CITRIS was developed at UCSC. The Real-time Environmental Information Network and Analysis System (REINAS) gathers data on the Monterey Bay coastal environment from an extensive network of remote sensors, stores it in a distributed database, and displays data on command via powerful graphics techniques. With REINAS, weather forecasters and environmental scientists can observe, monitor, and analyze regional oceanographic and meteorological phenomena in real time from their desktops. Systems based on the REINAS model have a wide range of potential applications, said Patrick Mantey, dean of UCSC's Baskin School of Engineering, who directs the REINAS project. "In this case it's environmental conditions in Monterey Bay, but it could just as well be traffic patterns or earthquake information," Mantey said. In addition to UCSC researchers, REINAS also involves scientists at the Naval Postgraduate School and the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute. Business and private donors have pledged CITRIS more than $173 million over four years, including nearly $50 million from industry and $124.5 million in individual donations. Along with the $100 million from the state and an expected $83 million in private and federal research grants and contracts, CITRIS would receive total funding of more than $356 million over four years. Among the 13 corporate sponsors are Intel Corp., Microsoft Corp., Nortel Networks Corp., and Sun Microsystems, Inc.

<p>
  The theater was packed and the audience let out a roaring cheer as last week's special late-morning performance of <i>Cinderella</i> began. The audience of nearly 500 youngsters from regional schools was treated to the show by UCSC as part of the campus's ongoing effort to expose young children to the educational and cultural opportunities of college.
</p>The show was a resounding hit.
<p>
  "If I were the president, I would let everyone see <i>Cinderella</i> for free," said Jose Cervantes, a seventh grader from Markham Middle School in San Jose.
</p>
<p>
  His classmate Jose Magana also gave the show his seal of approval. "I loved seeing a professional show like this one," he said. "It's the first I have been to, and I would like to take my mom and dad back to see it, too."
</p>
<p>
  Students from schools in Watsonville, Moss Landing, Castroville, and San Jose attended the show, which was one of two free performances of <i>Cinderella</i> that Shakespeare Santa Cruz offers each season to make the arts and theater experience available to a wider audience.
</p>
<p>
  The Early Academic Outreach Program (EAOP) was founded on the belief that experiencing the college environment at a young age makes a lasting impression and can help motivate students to prepare for and pursue a college education. A majority of the students who attended the performance participate year-round in EAOP programs at their schools. The EAOP is administered by UCSC's Educational Partnership Center (EPC).
</p>
<p>
  The EPC organized the trip, and the cost of tickets was covered by J. Michael Thompson, associate vice chancellor for outreach, admissions, and student academic services, and Carrol Moran, director of the EPC. The center and EAOP sponsored meals and transportation for the event.

        <title>Manganese exposure may speed the emergence of Parkinson's disease symptoms</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 04 Dec 2000 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  A new study suggests that too much manganese, an essential element required by the body in tiny amounts but toxic at elevated levels, may contribute to the early development of Parkinson's disease symptoms in susceptible people. Recent epidemiological studies have suggested an association between Parkinson's disease and elevated exposure to manganese. The new study in animals shows that exposure to low levels of manganese does not directly contribute to the disease, but affects a different part of the brain in a way that exacerbates the effects of Parkinson's. UCSC researchers evaluated the effects of low-level exposure to manganese using rats with a condition that mimics pre-Parkinsonism, an early stage of the disease in which no symptoms are apparent. Their findings were published in the current issue of the scientific journal <i>Neurotoxicology and Teratology.</i> The study highlights the importance of looking at the effects of toxic substances on sensitive subsets of the population who may be most vulnerable, said Donald Smith, an associate professor of environmental toxicology and a coauthor of the paper. "We are concerned about how chronic low-level exposures to toxic substances may accelerate the emergence of neurodegenerative diseases like Parkinson's," Smith said. The possibility that people in the early stages of Parkinsonism could be especially sensitive to moderately increased levels of manganese is disturbing for several reasons, he said. Manganese is ubiquitous in the environment, and its increasing use in industrial processes may cause some people to take in greater amounts from water, food, and airborne sources. In addition, increased exposure to airborne manganese could result from the use of the manganese compound MMT as a gasoline additive. MMT gained approval for use in the U.S. after its manufacturer, Ethyl Corporation, sued the Environmental Protection Agency and won. Currently, none of the major oil refineries are using MMT, but that could change, Smith noted. "We need better information about the potential risk to sensitive populations when we make decisions about things like MMT," Smith said. Parkinson's disease and manganese toxicity seem to affect different parts of the neurological pathway involved in muscle control, he said. In Parkinson's disease, loss of brain cells in a region called the substantia nigra results in reduced production of dopamine, a chemical involved in communication between nerve cells. The substantia nigra is part of the basal ganglia, the brain region responsible for fine-muscle control. Other parts of the basal ganglia, including the striatum and globus plallidus, are the targets of manganese toxicity. "If two areas in the same pathway are weakened, you get an additive impact, and that's what we believe occurred in this experiment," Smith said. In the experiment, rats were treated with a substance toxic to dopamine-producing nerve cells to induce a pre-Parkinson's condition. The treatment moderately reduced dopamine levels in the substantia nigra region of the rats' brains, but did not cause symptoms detectable in a battery of tests. This created a condition of pre-Parkinsonism mimicking the early neurodegenerative state in the progression of Parkinson's disease. Treated and untreated rats were then given low doses of manganese. The manganese had no effect on dopamine levels in the substantia nigra, but caused significant impairment of neurologic functions. Furthermore, some of the neurologic effects of manganese were more pronounced in the rats with pre-Parkinsonism. The toxic effects of manganese have long been known from studies of miners, steelworkers, and others with high occupational exposures. Chronic overexposure to manganese can lead to a disease known as manganism with symptoms similar to Parkinson's disease. But lower doses of manganese that can cause more subtle health effects are not well known, said Roberto Gwiazda, a research toxicologist and coauthor of the study. In the new study, rats showed impaired muscle control at manganese doses much lower than those used in previously published animal studies of manganese toxicity. But Gwiazda cautioned that the exposure regimen and route (a series of injections) were not comparable to typical environmental exposures in humans. Smith and his coworkers are currently conducting follow-up studies to determine the effects of different doses of manganese and to better understand the mechanisms underlying those effects. In addition to Smith and Gwiazda, the paper is coauthored by Ryan Witholt, who worked on the project as a UCSC undergraduate researcher.

        <title>Academic Senate endorses written evaluations</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>
  Faculty rejects plan to make 'narratives' optional
</h4>

<p>
  UCSC's Academic Senate last week reaffirmed its commitment to the campus's longstanding Narrative Evaluation System. The special session of the senate produced two critical votes on the subject: one rejecting a proposal that would have made the writing of "narratives" optional for faculty, and a second that supported UCSC's "commitment to multidimensional assessment of student performance." The votes drew a thunderous ovation from the students who were able to squeeze into the lecture hall and from the dozens more who listened to the proceedings via a speaker system set up outside. "We're doing some things right at UCSC, and part of what we're doing right is the NES [Narrative Evaluation System]," noted professor of linguistics James McCloskey, one of many faculty who rose to speak during the course of the nearly two-hour debate. The meeting on Monday (November 27) appeared to bring to a close 12 months of senate discussion about the manner in which UCSC assesses student performance. As a result of the pro-NES vote--and a vote on letter grades that was finalized only a month ago--students who enter UCSC next fall will receive letter grades in most of their courses and narratives in all of them. Some of the speakers at Monday's meeting said the NES requirement leads to the production of a large number of narratives that are not "meaningful" to the students for whom they are written. Manfred Warmuth, a professor of computer science and coauthor of the proposal to make the writing of narratives optional, argued that the campus's founders never intended for narratives to be required in all classes. More faculty, however, said the NES provides an important source of feedback for students. Carol Freeman, chair of UCSC's Writing Program and the senate's Committee on Educational Policy, said CEP had considered--and rejected--a handful of suggestions for reforming the Narrative Evaluation System. Requiring narratives in only small classes, for example, could reduce feedback in the classes students take in their majors, Freeman said. Requiring narratives in only upper-division courses, she added, would delay the feedback that NES supporters say the system provides. Making narratives optional, Freeman concluded, would have "unpredictable consequences" while devaluing "what UCSC stands for." In a voice vote reaffirming the NES, senators strongly endorsed a resolution authored by psychology professor Barbara Rogoff and linguistics professor William Ladusaw and cosigned by approximately 200 other faculty members. "Our decision today can provide leadership nationally," said Rogoff, noting that other campuses are considering expanding their student assessment systems beyond grades. The Rogoff-Ladusaw Reform Resolution did more than endorse the principle of written evaluations. According to a summary distributed at the meeting, the resolution proposed:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>That the senate's "Committee on Educational Policy issue revised guidelines for writing evaluations, emphasizing that evaluations should succinctly report the quality and characteristics of student performance and stressing flexibility for instructors in determining the extent of their evaluations."
  </li>
  <li>That the "administration provide support to simplify the process of writing evaluations, with software and transitional staff consultants to assist interested faculty with templates and records."
  </li>
  <li>That "fair policies for oversight of timeliness, if any are necessary, be devised jointly by faculty and administration."
  </li>
  <li>"Continuing support for the Registrar's work to reformat the transcript as a concise and professionally formatted document."
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Last December, UC Santa Cruz's Academic Senate postponed a vote on the campus's Narrative Evaluation System at a meeting that attracted approximately 1,000 student supporters of the longstanding practice. That special session had been prompted by a petition signed by more than 170 members of the senate who recommended that the campus's Narrative Evaluation System be replaced by the conventional UC grading system.<br>
  <br>
  At the senate's next meeting, on February 23, the senate approved the grades portion of the legislation. That legislation continues to permit UCSC undergraduate students to take courses on a Pass/No Pass (P/NP) basis. But, beginning with new undergraduates entering in fall 2001, no more than 25 percent of the UCSC course work that they apply toward graduation credit can be taken on a P/NP basis. No such threshold will exist for current students or new students entering UCSC before then.<br>
  <br>
  On March 31, the senate office received a letter from 27 members of the senate requesting that a "mail ballot" be issued asking all members to weigh in on the proposal to implement UC's conventional grading system next fall.<br>
  <br>
  At the senate's spring-quarter meeting, a discussion of the NES was postponed after a student protest blocked the entrances to the meeting hall.<br>
  <br>
  Just last month, the results of the mail ballot on grades were announced by senate chair Roger Anderson. By a 240-154 vote, the senate reaffirmed the February vote implementing UC's conventional grading system.

        <title>NAACP president Kweisi Mfume to address UCSC King Memorial Convocation</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 04 Dec 2000 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>2773</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_2772" align="alignright" width="180"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/12/mfume_kweisi.00-11-20.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2772" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/12/mfume_kweisi.00-11-20.jpg" alt="Kweisi Mfume" width="180" height="240" /></a>Kweisi Mfume[/caption]
<p>
  NAACP President Kweisi Mfume will be the keynote speaker at UC Santa Cruz's Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Convocation on January 24. The event begins at 7 P.M. at the Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium, 307 Church Street. It is free and open to the public.
</p>Mfume, who has led the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People since 1996, will speak on "Reaffirming America's Agenda." He will focus on the presidential election and the legacy of the nation's civil rights movement.<br>
<br>
"We feel extraordinarily fortunate in being able to secure him as a speaker," said John Holloway, executive director of student development and community service at UCSC and a member of the convocation planning committee. "I'm certain the community is in for a delight."<br>
<br>
The convocation is being presented in collaboration with the Santa Cruz chapter of the NAACP. Deborah Hill-Alston, president of the chapter, described Mfume as "a very dynamic personality" and praised his stewardship of the NAACP. "I think he's going to be a very inspirational speaker."<br>
<br>
Holloway said that Mfume was selected in part because of his political astuteness, especially appropriate after the presidential campaign. Voter registration and get-out-the-vote efforts were a major emphasis for Mfume and the NAACP during the recent campaign, and Mfume has urged a U.S. Justice Department investigation of allegations that some African Americans were hampered in their efforts to vote in Florida.<br>
<br>
Before becoming NAACP president and chief executive officer, Mfume represented Maryland's Seventh District in the U.S. House of Representatives for ten years, chairing the Congressional Black Caucus for two years and working in the House Democratic Caucus leadership.<br>
<br>
Mfume gave up his seat in Congress to assume the presidency of the NAACP. At the time, the organization was plagued by financial debts. Mfume has presided over elimination of the debt and carried out a number of new initiatives. Under his leadership, the NAACP has prodded television networks to increase diversity and launched the Economic Reciprocity Initiative, designed to monitor companies' performance in employment, community reinvestment, and other areas involving the African American market and African American consumers.<br>
<br>
The NAACP is the nation's oldest and largest civil rights organization. It was founded in 1909 and has 500,000 members.<br>
<br>
Mfume, whose West African name means "conquering son of kings," was born and raised in the Baltimore area and became politically active as head of the Black Student Union during his freshman year at Morgan State University. He returned to the university as an adjunct professor, teaching political science and communications. He later received a master's degree, with a concentration in international studies, from Johns Hopkins University.<br>
<br>
The annual Martin Luther King Jr. convocation celebrates the life of Dr. King by presenting speakers who discuss current civil rights issues of freedom, justice, and opportunity. The convocation also seeks to develop dialogue within the campus community and with the local communities served by UCSC. The 17th annual program does not require admission tickets. For more information or for disability-related needs, please call (831) 459-4058.<br>
<br>
Cosponsors include the City of Santa Cruz, KUSP-FM, and the <i>Santa Cruz Sentinel.<br></i><br>
<hr>
<br>
<br>
In a separate event, the Santa Cruz NAACP will present its annual Martin Luther King Banquet and Dance, on January 20, in honor of the slain civil rights leader.
<p>
  Set in the Sunroom at the Cocoanut Grove in Santa Cruz, it will begin with a social hour from 6 to 7 p.m., followed by a dinner and program from 7 to 9 p.m., and dancing from 9 to 11 p.m. Tickets are $35 per person, and may be ordered by calling the NAACP office at (831) 454-1478.

        <title>Chancellor holds fall forum with staff</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  Higher salaries for university employees are on the horizon, according to UCSC Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood, who attended the first staff forum of the academic year on November 20. More than 250 people turned out for the meeting, which addressed topics that included salaries, parking rates, campus growth, and union negotiations. The university is working in Sacramento to get an additional $24 million to "close the gap" and make staff salaries more competitive, said Greenwood, who was hopeful that the negotiations will be successful. "I do believe the Regents, the chancellors, and many legislators understand the significant need to enhance staff salaries," said Greenwood. "The time to close the gap is right now and in the next year or so." That news, coupled with the anticipated ratification by employees of a new contract with clerical union members, prompted Greenwood to announce that she believes the university has entered a "new era" of working with unions. Clerical employees can expect to see bigger paychecks beginning as early as February, if all goes well, said Greenwood, noting that some retroactive increases go back to 1999. All of the topics that were discussed during the hour-long meeting had been submitted in writing in advance to the Staff Advisory Board (SAB). Topics that were unaddressed due to time constraints will be posted on the SAB <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/sab/tree">web site</a> soon, said Willeen McQuitta, director of Staff Human Resources. One query focused on the upcoming winter closure, which its author disliked. In response, Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor John Simpson said his own research into the matter had suggested that the break is "enjoyed, indeed treasured, by most UCSC staff." Greenwood echoed that impression. "<i>Most</i> of what I hear is that many staff want the discretion to be with their families this time of year," she said. This year, the closure will require most employees to take two vacation days--or two days of unpaid leave, as Simpson pointed out. Employees also have the option of using compensatory time off to cover the two days<b>.</b> Both administrators expressed a willingness to revisit the issue, however. "People do differ in their opinions on this," said Greenwood. Regarding recruitment and retention of staff, Greenwood said the campus is considering the feasibility of offering bonuses to employees who recruit new staff members. In addition, changes have been made to simplify and streamline the reclassification system, she noted. A question about parking fees, which Greenwood jokingly described as her "favorite topic," prompted Greenwood to clarify that ongoing union negotiations with two groups of campus employees--faculty and clerical workers--have created disparities in what some employees are paying for "close-in" parking. Until negotiations are completed, faculty will continue to pay $32 per month and clerical workers will pay $29 per month, compared to the $54 per month that a standard "A" permit costs. Greenwood expressed her hope that those negotiations would be resolved soon. In the meantime, Transportation and Parking Services (TAPS) has bolstered <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/currents/99-00/03-20/bike.html">alternative transportation options</a> and introduced a cost-free <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/currents/00-01/09-25/taps.html">parking alternative</a> for employees who are willing to park at the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk and take a university shuttle up to campus. "Nobody is requiring you to spend $650 a year to be able to park next to your building," said TAPS director Wes Scott. "There are options." Scott advised against a graduated, or sliding scale, parking fee system, which he said is in use at only two universities in the country. They report that the system "sets people against each other," said Scott. "I'm not sure you want to go there."
</p>

<p>
  Regarding campus growth, Greenwood emphasized that a recent systemwide proposal to increase enrollment of community college transfer students has not yet been approved, and even if it is, it will not increase UCSC's long-range enrollment targets. The campus, which has 12,100 students enrolled this quarter, is poised to grow to 15,000 students by 2005-06 and 16,900 students by 2010-11.<br>
  <br>
  Such growth is necessary to meet "the responsibility we have as a public institution" to provide access to a UC education to the growing number of qualified students in the state, said Simpson.<br>
  <br>
  Systemwide, the university is speeding up the scheduled opening of the Merced campus. Locally, Greenwood emphasized that plans to accommodate the jump from 15,000 to 16,900 students do not include "growing" the Santa Cruz campus. Instead, students will be accommodated by:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Enrolling at the new regional center in Silicon Valley
  </li>
  <li>Participating in the Education Abroad Program
  </li>
  <li>Taking advantage of increased summer course offerings
  </li>
  <li>Enrolling in distance-learning classes and "testing out" of some courses
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  To bolster the academic side of the campus, nearly 50 new faculty members are being recruited this year, and staff are being hired, too, said Simpson.<br>
  <br>
  "I don't want people to get the feeling that the students are coming but the staff, faculty, and buildings are not coming," said Greenwood. "They are, but there is a lag."<br>
  <br>
  Finally, responding to a question from an audience member, Greenwood said she could not promise not to build housing at the site of Long Marine Laboratory formerly known as Terrace Point.<br>
  <br>
  "I wish I could justify not planning housing of any sort on that site," she said. Given the current housing crisis in Santa Cruz County, though, she said: "I'm not prepared to give up any option now." Any development on the site would, however, be modest and situated away from the bluffs toward the railroad tracks, she said.

  <b>PROFESSOR RONALD W. HENDERSON DIES AT 67</b><br>
  <br>
  Ronald W. Henderson, a professor emeritus of education and psychology at UCSC whose research focused on improving educational opportunities for underrepresented minorities, died at his Santa Cruz home November 24 after a lengthy battle with melanoma. He was 67. <img align="right" border="0" height="200" src="../art/henderson_ron.180.jpg" width="180" alt="">Henderson's dual academic interests in child development and education fueled his research on social and cultural influences on development, academic motivation, cognition, and mathematics and science education. His specific research interest was in the development of instructional approaches that would increase achievement and participation in mathematics by Latino students, women, and other groups that are underrepresented in math and the sciences. He specialized in the development of motivation to achieve and participate in mathematics. "Ron did a great deal of work in the schools that focused on the needs of underrepresented students," said close friend Edward Landesman, a professor emeritus of mathematics who collaborated with Henderson on numerous projects in Watsonville schools. "He had a strong desire to make sure those children were successfully prepared for higher education and careers." Henderson joined the UCSC faculty in 1977 and made numerous contributions to the campus during his tenure. He was named provost of Crown College in 1989 and served until 1993. He was a charter faculty member of UCSC's Bilingual Research Group and was active in the Monterey Bay Area Mathematics Project administered by UCSC. He served as chair of the UCSC Academic Senate from 1986 to 1988 and served on the senate's Academic Personnel Committee and the Committee on Budget and Planning. Henderson retired in 1994 but returned to campus on a part-time basis in 1995 to serve as dean of the Division of Graduate Studies. His illness, which had been diagnosed in 1995, forced him to retire in 1999. Henderson was an early advocate of educational collaborations and considered his greatest professional contribution his work with numerous local and regional elementary and high schools, especially in Watsonville and Salinas. Such collaborations are recognized today as valuable enhancements to both K-12 education and university research, but Henderson took the initiative for UCSC in facilitating school partnerships. Early in his career, Henderson concluded that a child's learning environment is a much stronger influence than socioeconomic status in developing intellectual competence. Henderson devised the Henderson Environmental Learning Process Scale (HELPS) to measure the characteristics of home environments. His early research revealed that the majority of variance in intellectual performance among Mexican American and Anglo American first graders could be accounted for by two factors: How much the parents valued language and school-related behavior, and the degree to which they provided a supportive environment for school learning. In research based on their work with predominantly Latino students on the Central Coast, Henderson and Landesman described the complex interrelationship of factors that contribute to student academic achievement in mathematics, including the student's own motivation, his or her approach to tasks, home influences, and the nature of classroom instruction. Motivating children to study math will require a broad-based partnership among educators, business leaders, and community members, they advised. Henderson and Landesman's highly regarded work received several grants from the National Science Foundation and the California Academic Partnership Program. Reflecting his early interest in school partnerships, Henderson in 1985 was named chair of a new committee charged with developing policy for the campus's outreach to schools. He described his goal at the time to "try to encourage faculty to work with schools in any variety of ways which could result in an improvement in the K-12 system." Henderson, who was born January 20, 1933, in Pocatello, Idaho, to the late Wilber T. Henderson and Delta Mae Howell-Henderson, received a doctorate in education from the University of Arizona, where he was a professor of educational psychology and coordinator of the Office of Child Research at the Arizona Center for Educational Research and Development before coming to UCSC. He was an assistant professor of education at the University of Oregon from 1966 to 1967. He earned a bachelor's degree in anthropology from Sacramento State College (now California State University, Sacramento). Henderson served in the United States Air Force from 1951 to 1955, including overseas service in Japan, the Philippine Islands, and Vietnam. He remained on Active Reserve status in the U.S. Air Force until 1960. Henderson is survived by his wife of 41 years, Miriam Leatrice Peterson Henderson; his daughter and her husband, Paige and Mark of Lathrop, CA; his son and his wife, Tom and Jill of Alamo, CA; his daughter and her husband, Holly and Adrian of Santa Cruz; and six grandchildren: Amanda Nichole, Richard Joseph, Michael Lee, Maya Rose, Ryan Thomas, and Kevin Ronald.

        <title>Academic Senate endorses written evaluations</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>
  Faculty rejects plan to make 'narratives' optional
</h4>

<p>
  UCSC's Academic Senate on Monday reaffirmed its commitment to the campus's longstanding Narrative Evaluation System. The special session of the senate produced two critical votes on the subject: one rejecting a proposal that would have made the writing of "narratives" optional for faculty, and a second that supported UCSC's "commitment to multidimensional assessment of student performance." The votes drew a thunderous ovation from the students who were able to squeeze into the lecture hall and from the dozens more who listened to the proceedings via a speaker system set up outside. "We're doing some things right at UCSC, and part of what we're doing right is the NES [Narrative Evaluation System]," noted professor of linguistics James McCloskey, one of many faculty who rose to speak during the course of the nearly two-hour debate. The meeting on Monday (November 27) appeared to bring to a close 12 months of senate discussion about the manner in which UCSC assesses student performance. As a result of the pro-NES vote--and a vote on letter grades that was finalized only a month ago--students who enter UCSC next fall will receive letter grades in most of their courses and narratives in all of them. Some of the speakers at Monday's meeting said the NES requirement leads to the production of a large number of narratives that are not "meaningful" to the students for whom they are written. Manfred Warmuth, a professor of computer science and coauthor of the proposal to make the writing of narratives optional, argued that the campus's founders never intended for narratives to be required in all classes. More faculty, however, said the NES provides an important source of feedback for students. Carol Freeman, chair of UCSC's Writing Program and the senate's Committee on Educational Policy, said CEP had considered--and rejected--a handful of suggestions for reforming the Narrative Evaluation System. Requiring narratives in only small classes, for example, could reduce feedback in the classes students take in their majors, Freeman said. Requiring narratives in only upper-division courses, she added, would delay the feedback that NES supporters say the system provides. Making narratives optional, Freeman concluded, would have "unpredictable consequences" while devaluing "what UCSC stands for." In a voice vote reaffirming the NES, senators strongly endorsed a resolution authored by psychology professor Barbara Rogoff and linguistics professor William Ladusaw and cosigned by approximately 200 other faculty members. "Our decision today can provide leadership nationally," said Rogoff, noting that other campuses are considering expanding their student assessment systems beyond grades. The Rogoff-Ladusaw Reform Resolution did more than endorse the principle of written evaluations. According to a summary distributed at the meeting, the resolution proposed:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>That the senate's "Committee on Educational Policy issue revised guidelines for writing evaluations, emphasizing that evaluations should succinctly report the quality and characteristics of student performance and stressing flexibility for instructors in determining the extent of their evaluations."
  </li>
  <li>That the "administration provide support to simplify the process of writing evaluations, with software and transitional staff consultants to assist interested faculty with templates and records."
  </li>
  <li>That "fair policies for oversight of timeliness, if any are necessary, be devised jointly by faculty and administration."
  </li>
  <li>"Continuing support for the Registrar's work to reformat the transcript as a concise and professionally formatted document."
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Last December, UC Santa Cruz's Academic Senate postponed a vote on the campus's Narrative Evaluation System at a meeting that attracted approximately 1,000 student supporters of the longstanding practice. That special session had been prompted by a petition signed by more than 170 members of the senate who recommended that the campus's Narrative Evaluation System be replaced by the conventional UC grading system.<br>
  <br>
  At the senate's next meeting, on February 23, the senate approved the grades portion of the legislation. That legislation continues to permit UCSC undergraduate students to take courses on a Pass/No Pass (P/NP) basis. But, beginning with new undergraduates entering in fall 2001, no more than 25 percent of the UCSC course work that they apply toward graduation credit can be taken on a P/NP basis. No such threshold will exist for current students or new students entering UCSC before then.<br>
  <br>
  On March 31, the senate office received a letter from 27 members of the senate requesting that a "mail ballot" be issued asking all members to weigh in on the proposal to implement UC's conventional grading system next fall.<br>
  <br>
  At the senate's spring-quarter meeting, a discussion of the NES was postponed after a student protest blocked the entrances to the meeting hall.<br>
  <br>
  Just last month, the results of the mail ballot on grades were announced by senate chair Roger Anderson. By a 240-154 vote, the senate reaffirmed the February vote implementing UC's conventional grading system.

        <title>Chancellor holds fall forum with staff</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  Higher salaries for university employees are on the horizon, according to UCSC Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood, who attended the first staff forum of the academic year on November 20. More than 250 people turned out for the meeting, which addressed topics that included salaries, parking rates, campus growth, and union negotiations. The university is working in Sacramento to get an additional $24 million to "close the gap" and make staff salaries more competitive, said Greenwood, who was hopeful that the negotiations will be successful. "I do believe the Regents, the chancellors, and many legislators understand the significant need to enhance staff salaries," said Greenwood. "The time to close the gap is right now and in the next year or so." That news, coupled with the anticipated ratification by employees of a new contract with clerical union members, prompted Greenwood to announce that she believes the university has entered a "new era" of working with unions. Clerical employees can expect to see bigger paychecks beginning as early as February, if all goes well, said Greenwood, noting that some retroactive increases go back to 1999. All of the topics that were discussed during the hour-long meeting had been submitted in writing in advance to the Staff Advisory Board (SAB). Topics that were unaddressed due to time constraints will be posted on the SAB <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/sab/tree">web site</a> soon, said Willeen McQuitta, director of Staff Human Resources. One query focused on the upcoming winter closure, which its author disliked. In response, Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor John Simpson said his own research into the matter had suggested that the break is "enjoyed, indeed treasured, by most UCSC staff." Greenwood echoed that impression. "<i>Most</i> of what I hear is that many staff want the discretion to be with their families this time of year," she said. This year, the closure will require most employees to take two vacation days--or two days of unpaid leave, as Simpson pointed out. Employees also have the option of using compensatory time off to cover the two days<b>.</b> Both administrators expressed a willingness to revisit the issue, however. "People do differ in their opinions on this," said Greenwood. Regarding recruitment and retention of staff, Greenwood said the campus is considering the feasibility of offering bonuses to employees who recruit new staff members. In addition, changes have been made to simplify and streamline the reclassification system, she noted. A question about parking fees, which Greenwood jokingly described as her "favorite topic," prompted Greenwood to clarify that ongoing union negotiations with two groups of campus employees--faculty and clerical workers--have created disparities in what some employees are paying for "close-in" parking. Until negotiations are completed, faculty will continue to pay $32 per month and clerical workers will pay $29 per month, compared to the $54 per month that a standard "A" permit costs. Greenwood expressed her hope that those negotiations would be resolved soon. In the meantime, Transportation and Parking Services (TAPS) has bolstered <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/currents/99-00/03-20/bike.html">alternative transportation options</a> and introduced a cost-free <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/currents/00-01/09-25/taps.html">parking alternative</a> for employees who are willing to park at the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk and take a university shuttle up to campus. "Nobody is requiring you to spend $650 a year to be able to park next to your building," said TAPS director Wes Scott. "There are options." Scott advised against a graduated, or sliding scale, parking fee system, which he said is in use at only two universities in the country. They report that the system "sets people against each other," said Scott. "I'm not sure you want to go there."
</p>

<p>
  Regarding campus growth, Greenwood emphasized that a recent systemwide proposal to increase enrollment of community college transfer students has not yet been approved, and even if it is, it will not increase UCSC's long-range enrollment targets. The campus, which has 12,100 students enrolled this quarter, is poised to grow to 15,000 students by 2005-06 and 16,900 students by 2010-11.<br>
  <br>
  Such growth is necessary to meet "the responsibility we have as a public institution" to provide access to a UC education to the growing number of qualified students in the state, said Simpson.<br>
  <br>
  Systemwide, the university is speeding up the scheduled opening of the Merced campus. Locally, Greenwood emphasized that plans to accommodate the jump from 15,000 to 16,900 students do not include "growing" the Santa Cruz campus. Instead, students will be accommodated by:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Enrolling at the new regional center in Silicon Valley
  </li>
  <li>Participating in the Education Abroad Program
  </li>
  <li>Taking advantage of increased summer course offerings
  </li>
  <li>Enrolling in distance-learning classes and "testing out" of some courses
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  To bolster the academic side of the campus, nearly 50 new faculty members are being recruited this year, and staff are being hired, too, said Simpson.<br>
  <br>
  "I don't want people to get the feeling that the students are coming but the staff, faculty, and buildings are not coming," said Greenwood. "They are, but there is a lag."<br>
  <br>
  Finally, responding to a question from an audience member, Greenwood said she could not promise not to build housing at the site of Long Marine Laboratory formerly known as Terrace Point.<br>
  <br>
  "I wish I could justify not planning housing of any sort on that site," she said. Given the current housing crisis in Santa Cruz County, though, she said: "I'm not prepared to give up any option now." Any development on the site would, however, be modest and situated away from the bluffs toward the railroad tracks, she said.

<p>
  Among the large mammals that roamed prehistoric North America was a type of rhinoceros that seems to have lived in the water, much like a modern hippopotamus. The extinct rhinoceros, known as Teleoceras, ranged from Florida to the West Coast from about 17 million years ago until about 4.5 million years ago. Its semi-aquatic lifestyle, first suggested by its body shape, has been disputed by some researchers. But evidence preserved in fossil teeth now indicates that in some areas, at least, Teleoceras did spend much of its life in the water.
</p>"Morphologically, Teleoceras looked a lot like modern hippos, with large, squat bodies and short legs, and we now have evidence from isotope analysis that they were semi-aquatic like hippos," said Mark Clementz, a graduate student in Earth sciences, who presented his findings at the Geological Society of America meeting on November 14.<br>
<br>
Clementz and Paul Koch, an associate professor of Earth sciences, analyzed oxygen isotopes in fossil Teleoceras teeth for clues to the animals' habits. Oxygen occurs in nature as three different isotopes. The two heavy isotopes are very rare (together they make up less than 0.5 percent of all oxygen atoms), but their greater mass has interesting consequences. Evaporation, for example, acts preferentially to remove water molecules containing the common, light isotope of oxygen. The water left behind, whether in a puddle or in the body of an animal, ends up with a higher proportion of heavy oxygen isotopes.<br>
<br>
The Teleoceras study grew out of work Koch had done on modern mammals in East Africa comparing different species within the same ecosystem. Koch observed that hippo teeth contain a higher proportion of the light isotope of oxygen than the teeth of land animals, such as rhinos, zebras, and elephants. He attributed this to differences in the amount of water the animals lost through evaporation.<br>
<br>
"Hippos wouldn't evaporate much because they're in the water all day and only leave the water to graze at night when it's cool and humid," Koch said. "When we analyzed oxygen isotope compositions in fossil hippo teeth, we saw the same thing."<br>
<br>
But when Bruce MacFadden at the University of Florida applied this technique to Teleoceras several years ago, he found no significant difference in oxygen isotope compositions between Teleoceras and other animals in the same ecosystem. MacFadden concluded that Teleoceras were terrestrial grazers.<br>
<br>
In the new study, Clementz took a different approach, looking at the variability of isotope compositions within populations rather than averaging all the measurements for a given species. He analyzed teeth from a variety of modern terrestrial and aquatic mammals before applying the technique to Teleoceras.<br>
<br>
"We found very low variability in aquatic mammals, including dolphins, seals, and river otters, versus much higher variability in land mammals," Clementz said.<br>
<br>
The researchers attribute the low variability in aquatic mammals to the fact that all the water they take in comes from the same source, so the oxygen isotope composition in their bodies remains relatively stable. In land mammals, however, isotope composition varies between individuals and even within the same animal from hour to hour, Koch said.<br>
<br>
"In a population of deer, for example, one deer might drink from a puddle that's been evaporating in the sun, another from a creek, and some live in hotter environments than others, so their isotope compositions will vary," Koch said.<br>
<br>
Since a tooth forms within a relatively narrow window of time, the oxygen isotope composition in the body at that time gets locked into carbonate molecules in the tooth's enamel. Variability among samples can make it hard to obtain an accurate average value, but the variability itself turns out to be a useful source of information, Koch noted.<br>
<br>
Clementz analyzed fossil teeth of Teleoceras and other mammals from the <a href="http://www-museum.unl.edu/research/vertpaleo/ashfall.html">Ashfall Fossil Beds</a> in Nebraska, one of the most spectacular fossil sites in the world.Whole herds of Teleoceras and other animals died and were buried by volcanic ash at the Ashfall site, where paleontologists have uncovered numerous intact skeletons of North America's ancient fauna. Clementz found much less variability in the oxygen isotope compositions of Teleoceras teeth than in other animals, as would be expected for a semi-aquatic mammal.<br>
<br>
At two other sites, Clementz found somewhat more variability in Teleoceras, although it was still relatively low compared to known land mammals. This finding, together with the broad geographic range of Teleoceras, suggests they may have adapted their behavior to different environments. "In Nebraska, there's no question they were semi-aquatic, but they may have been more flexible in their ecological niche than modern hippos," Clementz said.

<p>
  Stanford University Press published two books this year by Harry Berger Jr., professor emeritus of literature and art history: <i>Fictions of the Pose: Rembrandt Against the Italian Renaissance</i> and <i>The Absence of Grace: Sprezzatura and Suspicion in Two Renaissance Courtesy Books</i> appeared in September. The former received a publication subsidy award of $8,000 from the Millard Meiss Publication Fund Committee of the College Art Association<i>.</i> Berger also published an essay entitled "Second-World Prosthetics: Supplying Deficiencies of Nature in Renaissance Italy," in <i>Early Modern Visual Culture,</i> ed. Clark Hulse and Peter Erickson (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2000)<b>.</b>
</p>

<p>
  Berger's book, <i>Making Trifles of Terrors: Redistributing Complicities in Shakespeare</i> (Stanford, Calif.: Stanford University Press, 1997), was the subject of a special forum in <i>Shakespeare Studies,</i> Volume 26, ed. Leeds Barroll (Cranbury, N.J., and London: Associate University Presses, 1999); contributors include Stanley Cavell and Angus Fletcher.
</p>

<p>
  In April 1999, Berger delivered the annual Shakespeare Birthday Lecture at the Folger Shakespeare Institute, and in June 1999, he delivered the annual Elizabeth Drew Lecture at the Bread Loaf School of English, Middlebury College. In May 2001, he will be the keynote speaker at two conferences: the Pacific Northwest Renaissance Conference in Vancouver and the Renaissance Conference of Southern California at the Huntington Library in San Marino.

</p>Professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology<br>
<br>
John Thompson studies how interactions among species organize the earth's biodiversity over broad geographic landscapes. His long-term goal is to understand how coevolution between plants and animals connects biological communities both locally and globally. He is also concerned with how humans are reshaping the ecology and evolution of species interactions by fragmenting landscapes and introducing new species. Thompson's work combines ecological, genetic, molecular, and evolutionary approaches to address questions on how evolution and coevolution affect ecological processes. Thompson received his B.A. in biology from Washington and Jefferson College and his Ph.D. in ecology from the University of Illinois, Urbana. Before joining the UCSC faculty, he was a professor of botany and zoology at Washington State University.<br>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_2756" align="alignright" width="180"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/11/mfume_kweisi.00-11-20.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2756" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/11/mfume_kweisi.00-11-20.jpg" alt="Kweisi Mfume" width="180" height="240" /></a>Kweisi Mfume[/caption]
<p>
  NAACP President Kweisi Mfume will be the keynote speaker at UC Santa Cruz's Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Convocation on January 24. The event begins at 7 P.M. at the Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium, 307 Church Street. It is free and open to the public.
</p>Mfume, who has led the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People since 1996, will speak on "Reaffirming America's Agenda." He will focus on the presidential election and the legacy of the nation's civil rights movement.<br>
<br>
"We feel extraordinarily fortunate in being able to secure him as a speaker," said John Holloway, executive director of student development and community service at UCSC and a member of the convocation planning committee. "I'm certain the community is in for a delight."<br>
<br>
The convocation is being presented in collaboration with the Santa Cruz chapter of the NAACP. Deborah Hill-Alston, president of the chapter, described Mfume as "a very dynamic personality" and praised his stewardship of the NAACP. "I think he's going to be a very inspirational speaker."<br>
<br>
Holloway said that Mfume was selected in part because of his political astuteness, especially appropriate after the presidential campaign. Voter registration and get-out-the-vote efforts were a major emphasis for Mfume and the NAACP during the recent campaign, and Mfume has urged a U.S. Justice Department investigation of allegations that some African Americans were hampered in their efforts to vote in Florida.<br>
<br>
Before becoming NAACP president and chief executive officer, Mfume represented Maryland's Seventh District in the U.S. House of Representatives for ten years, chairing the Congressional Black Caucus for two years and working in the House Democratic Caucus leadership.<br>
<br>
Mfume gave up his seat in Congress to assume the presidency of the NAACP. At the time, the organization was plagued by financial debts. Mfume has presided over elimination of the debt and carried out a number of new initiatives. Under his leadership, the NAACP has prodded television networks to increase diversity and launched the Economic Reciprocity Initiative, designed to monitor companies' performance in employment, community reinvestment, and other areas involving the African American market and African American consumers.<br>
<br>
The NAACP is the nation's oldest and largest civil rights organization. It was founded in 1909 and has 500,000 members.<br>
<br>
Mfume, whose West African name means "conquering son of kings," was born and raised in the Baltimore area and became politically active as head of the Black Student Union during his freshman year at Morgan State University. He returned to the university as an adjunct professor, teaching political science and communications. He later received a master's degree, with a concentration in international studies, from Johns Hopkins University.<br>
<br>
The annual Martin Luther King Jr. convocation celebrates the life of Dr. King by presenting speakers who discuss current civil rights issues of freedom, justice, and opportunity. The convocation also seeks to develop dialogue within the campus community and with the local communities served by UCSC. The 17th annual program does not require admission tickets. For more information or for disability-related needs, please call (831) 459-4058.<br>
<br>
Cosponsors include the City of Santa Cruz, KUSP-FM, and the <i>Santa Cruz Sentinel.<br></i><br>
<hr>
<br>
<br>
In a separate event, the Santa Cruz NAACP will present its annual Martin Luther King Banquet and Dance, on January 20, in honor of the slain civil rights leader.
<p>
  Set in the Sunroom at the Cocoanut Grove in Santa Cruz, it will begin with a social hour from 6 to 7 p.m., followed by a dinner and program from 7 to 9 p.m., and dancing from 9 to 11 p.m. Tickets are $35 per person, and may be ordered by calling the NAACP office at (831) 454-1478.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_2749" align="alignright" width="190"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/11/turkey.00-11-20.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2749" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/11/turkey.00-11-20.jpg" alt="Photo: Joy Von Tiedemann for Canadian Living" width="190" height="190" /></a>Photo: Joy Von Tiedemann for Canadian Living[/caption]
<p>
  Instead of turkey and mashed potatoes, imagine filling your holiday plate with fried spiders and rattlesnake. Sound yucky? Welcome to the world of food preferences, where what is considered delicious--and disgusting--is more a matter of culture than most people think.
</p>"People feel very strongly about what they will and won't eat," said sociologist Dane Archer. "Westerners cringe at the thought of some Asian cultures that eat dog meat, because dogs are sacred in our culture. But Hindus feel the same way about cows and are horrified by the 'dead animal' racks in our supermarkets."<br>
<br>
Food preferences and taboos are extremely emotional and value-laden, said Archer. People tend to regard their own diet as sensible and the diets of other cultures as bizarre or irrational, all of which makes food a "powerful way to teach about cultural diversity and tolerance," he said.<br>
<br>
Archer, a professor of sociology at UC Santa Cruz, has produced a new educational video about food, entitled <i>A World of Food: Tastes and Taboos in Different Cultures.</i> The engaging 35-minute video features interviews with people from different cultures and undercuts the dominant Western view that "what we eat is normal and what everybody else eats is strange."<br>
<br>
The video describes the prohibitions against certain foods in the major religions of the world and presents a seven-rung food ladder, or "hierarchy of eligible foods," that ranks what is considered edible, delicious, and disgusting in various cultures. Viewers learn the critical lesson that all cultures, including American culture, consume foods that people in other cultures see as highly debatable, inherently disgusting, or simply too bizarre to eat at all.<br>
<br>
"Many staples of the American diet, from hamburgers to Jell-O, are repulsive to non-Westerners," said Archer. "Once people appreciate that, it's easier to regard other cultural food choices with less suspicion. American food occupies one small point on a broad spectrum of possible diets."<br>
<br>
As described in the video, the traditional Thanksgiving meal of turkey, stuffing, and cranberry sauce caused misery for a Filipina who had recently emigrated to the United States. In the video, her daughter describes the woman's desire to be a polite guest despite the disgust she felt about the food she was served. After managing to consume her portion, she had to excuse herself to the bathroom, where she became physically ill.<br>
<br>
Western viewers may recoil at descriptions in the video of tacos made with cow eyeballs, meals that feature an animal's entire head, and "chocolate meat" (pork cooked with pig's blood and intestines), but they'll likely be surprised by interviews in which a young man of Mexican heritage describes the repulsive combination of celery and peanut butter, followers of Islam marvel at the prevalence of pork in the American diet, and a Hindu man describes the humiliation he felt upon learning that the Jell-O he is fond of is made with gelatin from cow hooves.<br>
<br>
Archer, who has produced a series of videotapes about nonverbal communication, said he tackled the subject of food prejudice as a way to address the themes of cultural differences and misunderstandings that emerged in his work on communication.<br>
<br>
"The key to the system is understanding that wherever you are on the food ladder, chances are you consider the lower rungs morally disgusting," explained Archer. "And wherever you are on the ladder, someone is viewing your choices with disgust, too. Understanding that hierarchy helps break down all those ethnocentric assumptions that 'our way is the right way.'"<br>
<br>
Or, as a Hindu woman in the video put it: "Every Hindu is taught to respect everyone's culture, because we are all rivers that come into an ocean."

        <title>UCSC Fire Department bolsters force</title>

<p>
  Todd Meyer has wanted to be a firefighter as long as he can remember. Now, the burly 30-year-old from Bonny Doon can claim his own bunk at UCSC's Fire Station.
</p>Meyer is one of four new members of UCSC's 13-member team, which is growing as the campus grows."We're elated," said Fire Chief Charles Hernandez. "These positions have been part of my business plan for five years, so it's great to have them on board."<br>
<br>
Meyer and his colleagues Zane Brown, Ron Esche, and Coleen Ulrich joined the department as permanent, full-time employees in October. For each of them, the job is not only a dream come true, it represents a triumph against incredible odds: At least 1,000 Fire Academy graduates typically vie for every job opening these days. The competition includes a written examination, physical agility testing, and, with luck, an oral interview.<br>
<br>
All four had extensive volunteer firefighting experience, and three had worked with the California Department of Forestry fighting seasonal wildfires.<br>
<br>
Brown, who grew up in the small Sonoma County town of Occidental, worked his way up to acting captain with the all-volunteer Occidental Fire Department. His father and uncle were both firefighters before him. Esche, too, is the son of a firefighter, while Ulrich caught the bug nine years ago from her exhusband, who volunteered with the Bonny Doon Fire Department.<br>
<br>
One of the big challenges of being a career firefighter is surrendering to the schedule. Each member of the UCSC department works a 24-hour shift, has a day off, works another 24-hour shift, has a day off, works a final 24-hour shift and then gets four days off. Working on holidays, birthdays, and anniversaries is part of the job, and the schedule supersedes attending school plays, recitals, and family reunions.<br>
<br>
But the rewards of a career in firefighting are many. A certain fourth-grader at Bonny Doon Elementary School idolizes Ulrich, who coordinates the fire-prevention program for the school. No two days are alike, said Esche. And there is infinite satisfaction in a job that every day entails helping people and literally saving lives.<br>
<br>
"I had a boy from the school tell me that my words came back to him when his Halloween costume caught fire," recalled Ulrich. "He remembered what I'd taught them about 'Stop, drop, and roll.' That was great. For me, if I can save one child's life, it has all been worth it."<br>
<br>
The new hires also help the department meet new state regulations that require a minimum of four firefighters on the scene of a structural fire before two can enter the building. The new "two in, two out" rule, adopted by California's Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Cal-OSHA), was designed to protect firefighters by ensuring that a backup team would be available to conduct a rescue, if necessary, explained Hernandez.<br>
<br>
Since 1993, the department has operated with only three firefighters per shift, and sometimes two, depending on illness and vacation schedules, said Hernandez, who was appointed chief in 1994.<br>
<br>
Although current higher staffing levels enhance firefighter protection, Hernandez hopes to hire two additional firefighters in the next two years.<br>
<br>
For Captain Mike Quinton, the allure of firefighting has not worn off. "When I was 24, I realized that this is what I've always wanted to do," he said. "I'm 53 now, and I really enjoy helping people. In an emergency, when everything is chaos, I get to help bring things back as near as possible to normal for people's lives."<br>
<br>
With luck, UCSC's four new firefighters will be saying the same thing 30 years from now.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  Like fire departments nationally, the vast majority of the 500 calls fielded annually by the UCSC Fire Department are not fire-related. About 80 percent are emergency medical services, or EMS, calls. Other calls include nuisance and false alarms, elevator rescues, hazardous materials spills, cave rescues, and water vacuuming to clean up leaks and flooding. The bulk of each workday is spent performing nonemergency fire-prevention services. With the exception of historic structures like the Blacksmith Shop, every building on campus is equipped with a fire alarm. "Early warning" systems, including alarms and fire and heat detectors, alert the campus's emergency dispatcher of potential problems. In addition, UCSC boasts many well-designed buildings that incorporate fire-rated walls, doors, windows, and utility shafts. Although smoking remains the most common cause of fires nationally, the biggest cause of fires on campus is candles, which UCSC policy technically allows only as decorative items. Some calls, like cave rescues, are due to UCSC's terrain. Others reflect the unique population of a college community. The range of medical calls at UCSC varies from sports injuries and muscle cramps to alcohol or drug-related calls and suicide attempts. Bicycle accidents are all too common, said Captain Mike Quinton. "Last year, a woman crashed her bike on the dirt road near the Farm," he said. "Her helmet was literally split in two. When the paramedics got there, they said, 'We told you to get a helmet.' It turned out she'd been in a bike accident in town the week before without a helmet. This time she had one, and it saved her head." Lots of the work is routine, including conducting safety inspections, servicing campus fire extinguishers and hydrants; providing campus CPR and first aid training; inspecting fire alarms, sprinklers, and smoke detectors; and conducting public education programs. Additionally, firefighters spend dozens of hours each year in training programs so they'll literally be ready for anything. "In the 30 years I've been a firefighter, we've added so many skills--hazardous material spills, releases, and response training; confined space rescues; and emergency medical response," said Quinton, who lately has been studying the hazards of cutting into electric cars to rescue victims of vehicle accidents. "That's the thrill of this job--the inventory of skills, knowledge, and education we have to maintain. You could never train enough." And every now and then, something truly bizarre happens. "We got a call one weekend that an aircraft was down over by Oakes College," said Quinton. "On the way over, I was trying to get more information, but it turned out the pilot of this two-seater plane had deliberately landed on the grass there. He was fine--he said he'd had carburetor trouble. When he wanted to take off, I pointed out that his 'runway' was full of gopher holes and rocks, but he did it anyway. That was something." UCSC firefighters work ten 24-hour shifts per month, rotating through four spare bedrooms and sharing meals in a combined kitchen/living area at the campus Fire Station near the Crown-Merrill Apartments. In addition to the obvious risks of fighting fires, on-the-job hazards lurk in unexpected places, such as on the scene of automobile accidents. Firefighters have suffered broken arms when air bags activated as they tried to rescue trapped motorists, said Quinton. Nevertheless, Quinton said he feels safer responding to calls today than when he became a firefighter three decades ago, largely because of advancements in the protective gear firefighters wear and the availability of more sophisticated firefighting and medical tools. The origins of the UCSC Fire Department lie in the ashes of the most spectacular fire the campus has experienced. In April 1971, Hahn Student Services burned to the ground, leaving only the concrete walls behind. With the flames went all of the registrar's historical records and admissions data. The fire, which broke out in the middle of the night, was caused by an extension cord that had become frayed by foot traffic in what was then the Chancellor's Office. The building lacked any early warning systems--no alarm, no fire detectors, no sprinklers. And the campus lacked a fire department. By the time a resident in town noticed the plume of smoke and called the city fire department, the building was completely engulfed by flames. Later that year, the UCSC Fire Department was established. The current station, located near the Crown-Merrill Apartments, opened in 1975 when that area was considered the center of what was then planned as a 27-college university.

  <font color="#003399">Yolanda Padron</font>
</h4>

<p>
  The UCSC-based Center for Research on Education, Diversity & Excellence (CREDE) has appointed Yolanda Padron as the first codirector of the center. Padron is a professor of curriculum and instruction at the University of Houston and a CREDE researcher. She specializes in resiliency among English language learners. As codirector, Padron will oversee the creation of working groups of CREDE researchers, policy makers, and teachers.
</p>

<p>
  "We're excited and happy Yolanda has joined our leadership team," said CREDE director Roland Tharp, a professor of psychology and education at UCSC. "She's a distinguished researcher, and her excellent work helps us broaden our institutional base and strengthen our regional affiliations."
</p>

<p>
  UCSC was selected by the federal Department of Education in 1996 to administer CREDE, a national center focused on the needs of students whose education is at risk due to factors such as limited English proficiency, race, poverty, and geographic location. CREDE's goals include identifying the most effective instructional standards for at-risk students and helping to shape federal educational policy to support their needs.<br>

        <title>UC's budget plan for 2001-02 invests in access to high-quality education</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  <a href="mailto:XX@cats.ucsc.edu"><br></a>UC Office of the President <b><br></b>The University of California Board of Regents today (November 16) approved a 2001-02 budget proposal that focuses on expanding UC's contributions to the California economy, improving student access to a UC education, and preserving high-quality teaching, research and public service. The budget proposal places special emphasis on increasing UC staff employee salaries that lag the marketplace, maintaining competitive faculty salaries, and improving financial support for graduate education. It also would provide the second installment of funding in a multi-year program to strengthen undergraduate education, while keeping mandatory systemwide student fees unchanged. "This budget reflects UC's continuing commitment to offering a place at the university to California's high-achieving students and providing them with an education of the highest quality," said UC President Richard C. Atkinson. "It also addresses the needs of our hard-working employees and furthers UC's investments in the economic health and well-being of California as a whole." UC's state-funded operating budget would rise 7.7 percent to $3.45 billion under the budget plan. The university's total budget--reflecting funds from all sources, including federal funds for the three national laboratories managed by UC--would be approximately $15.7 billion. Excluding the labs, the total budget would be approximately $12.5 billion. The university's state budget request is built on a "partnership agreement" reached this year with Governor Gray Davis. The partnership provides for predictable annual increases in state General Fund support for UC, along with the university's commitment to meeting accountability goals in specific areas of performance, which the university is currently meeting or exceeding. Below are highlights of the 2001-02 budget proposal.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Expanding UC's contributions to the California economy<br>
  <br></b>The university is placing a high priority on increasing financial support for graduate education this year. California's success in the global economy is tied to the research innovations and trained workforce provided by UC graduate education programs, but enrollments have not kept pace with the state's needs. The budget calls for a multi-year effort to increase UC graduate enrollments and expand financial support for graduate students (see separate <a href="grad_students.html">story</a>).<br>
  <br>
  Also, the budget includes funding for 1,000 additional undergraduate and graduate students in engineering and computer science, part of an eight-year plan to expand these enrollments by 50 percent to help meet California's high-tech workforce needs. In addition, UC plans to increase enrollments in its teacher credential programs by 500 students in 2001-02, part of a four-year effort to double these enrollments and provide more well-trained teachers for California's classrooms.<br>
  <br>
  The budget requests $75 million as the second of four installments of state funding for the California Institutes for Science and Innovation, three new research facilities that will be located on UC campuses. These institutes will bring together researchers from a variety of disciplines to develop the next generation of knowledge in specific scientific fields that are key to the future of the California economy. The locations of the institutes will be announced later this year.<br>
  <br>
  If state money is available, the budget also requests funding for several research initiatives in areas relevant to the state's economic health and well-being, including environmental science, engineering and computer science, pest management, public health and demographic change.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Ensuring access for all UC-eligible students<br>
  <br></b>The budget requests the funding necessary for UC to continue to admit all UC-eligible students and provide them with a high-quality education. The budget includes funding for an additional 5,700 students in 2001-02, or enrollment growth of 3.5 percent. This growth is part of a 12-year, population-driven enrollment expansion that is expected to add 63,000 UC students between 1998-99 and 2010-11.<br>
  <br>
  The budget requests $4 million above the basic partnership budget to expand programs aimed at increasing the number of students who transfer to UC from community colleges. These funds would increase the number of counselors providing guidance about the transfer process, expand a computerized information system aimed at transfer students, and develop new approaches to helping students become transfer-ready.<br>
  <br>
  In addition, the budget requests funding above the partnership budget to expand outreach and student retention programs. These include programs to prepare students from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds for graduate and professional school, to expand outreach services to K-12 students and teachers in the San Joaquin Valley and other rural areas of the state, and to provide more counseling and other programs aimed at keeping UC students on track toward a degree.<br>
  <br>
  For the seventh consecutive year, mandatory systemwide student fees would not increase under the budget plan. These fees would remain at $3,429 for resident undergraduates and $3,609 for resident graduate academic students, excluding miscellaneous campus-based fees. Between 1998-99 and 1999-2000, mandatory systemwide fees actually decreased 10 percent for resident undergraduates and 5 percent for resident graduate academic students.<br>
  <br>
  Nonresident tuition would increase 4.5 percent ($460), consistent with state policy that ties tuition for out-of-state students to the actual cost of instruction and to the nonresident charges at comparable universities.<br>
  <br>
  The budget also places an emphasis on efforts to strengthen the undergraduate educational experience for UC students overall by requesting an $8 million increase to the $6 million provided in the 2000-01 year for this purpose. This funding supports such efforts as reducing class sizes, offering additional lower-division seminars, providing more undergraduate research opportunities and offering more academic advising.<br>
  <br>
  Finally, the budget requests state support for summer instruction at three campuses--UC Berkeley, UCLA and UC Santa Barbara--which are taking the lead in expanding summer coursework as a response to enrollment growth. Historically, the state has not funded summer instruction. Additional campuses would be phased into this program in subsequent years.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Providing competitive compensation for UC employees<br>
  <br></b>The budget requests funding for an average 2 percent employee salary increase, along with funding for merit increases for eligible employees.<br>
  <br>
  In addition, UC is making a substantial effort in the 2001-02 budget to improve compensation for staff positions where pay levels currently lag the market. The budget requests an additional 2 percent funding to bring these salaries closer to levels that are competitive in the marketplace. Of this $24 million request, $14 million is above the basic partnership budget and thus not guaranteed. UC will argue for the full amount, however, as an important means of attracting and retaining talented staff.<br>
  <br>
  This effort comes on the heels of a similar $19 million augmentation in the 2000-01 budget for salaries of lower-paid staff employees. Actual distribution of salary increases varies by compensation program and is subject to collective bargaining requirements (see separate <a href="initiative.html">story</a>).<br>
  <br>
  Faculty would be given an additional 1 percent increase to keep their salaries competitive with those of UC's comparison institutions across the country.<br>
  <br>
  Additionally, UC is requesting $20 million in one-time state funds for the planning and construction of expanded childcare facilities at UC campuses. These facilities currently serve about 2,000 children of UC staff, faculty and students, but the demand for these services is much greater.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Addressing needed facilities improvements<br>
  <br></b>The Regents approved a $203 million bond-funded capital improvements budget, consistent with voter-approved Proposition 1A. The capital budget includes projects to replace aging facilities, renovate seismically vulnerable buildings and construct new facilities for enrollment growth at UC campuses. The university also is seeking $160 million in state General Fund money for construction of the first buildings and infrastructure at UC Merced.<br>
  <br>
  The operating budget proposal approved by the Regents also requests additional funding for building maintenance, instructional equipment, instructional technology and library materials, all areas that have suffered from recurring budget shortfalls.<br>
  <br>
  The operating and capital budgets serve as UC's annual funding request to the governor and Legislature. Final university spending decisions for the 2001-02 fiscal year will be made after the governor and Legislature complete the state budget process next year.

        <title>Regents act to improve salaries, benefits for UC staff</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  <b><br></b> The UC Board of Regents today (November 16) approved a proposed 2001-02 budget for the University of California that would significantly improve wages and benefits for UC employees by increasing staff salaries that lag the marketplace and by expanding UC's child care program. In a separate action, the Regents approved a new program to expand eligibility for UC retirement benefits to certain "casual" employees. Today's actions represent the second year of a multi-year effort by UC to improve its ability to recruit and retain talented employees. "As one of the largest public employers in the state, we recognize our obligation to find innovative ways to attract and retain excellent staff," said UC President Richard C. Atkinson. "Today's actions take a significant step forward by offering better wages for staff employees, a new child care initiative to make UC more attractive to working parents, and retirement benefits for thousands of casual employees." <b><br>
  Salary increases<br>
  <br></b> Among the key employee wage and benefit improvements contained in the Regents' 2001-02 budget proposal are faculty and staff salary increases as follows:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Average 2 percent employee salary increase<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Merit increases for eligible employees<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>2 percent funding increase to improve salaries for staff and non-faculty academic positions where pay levels currently lag the market. Part of the funding for this item is within the budget "partnership" between UC and Gov. Gray Davis, and part of it would be funding above the partnership amount.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>1 percent parity increase to keep faculty salaries market-competitive
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Actual distribution of salary increases varies by compensation program and is subject to collective bargaining requirements.<br>
  <br>
  Earlier this year, the university supported a $19 million augmentation in the 2000-01 state budget to raise the salaries of lower-paid employees. As a result, staff salary rates equal to or below $40,000 per year were increased 2 percent beyond the regular salary program, and staff salary rates between $40,000 and $80,000 were increased 1 percent beyond the normal program. (These increases varied based on the results of collective bargaining for union-represented employees.)<br>
  <br>
  With their approval of the 2001-02 budget proposal, the Regents requested another $24 million to continue moving staff wages closer to market averages.<br>
  <b><br>
  Expanded child care services<br>
  <br></b> Another significant proposal in next year's UC budget is the expansion of child care services. The university has identified child care as a high-priority area and requested $20 million in one-time state General Funds to expand its services through the construction of new facilities.<br>
  <br>
  Currently, the university serves approximately 2,000 children through these programs. However, there is a list of approximately 2,000 children waiting to enter UC child care. The funding requested in the budget would enable UC to accommodate an additional 1,000 children each year.<br>
  <br>
  Expanded child care for the children of university staff, faculty and students is a crucial component of the university's recruitment and retention strategy.<br>
  <b><br>
  Casual employment reforms<br>
  <br></b> Another initiative approved by the Regents is a program to expand UC Retirement Plan (UCRP) eligibility to certain casual employees who work enough hours to qualify, with exceptions for per diem, temporary pool and student employees. Casual employees are essentially workers who are hired to work on special projects or help with peak workloads for a limited term.<br>
  <br>
  Effective Jan. 1, 2001, a limited-term employee will become a UCRP member after accumulating 1,000 hours on pay status during a rolling 12-month period. Because eligibility for health and welfare benefits is based in part on UCRP membership, this UCRP change will result in an expansion of health and welfare eligibility for this group. UCRP membership will be effective the first of the month following the attainment of the 1,000-hour threshold.<br>
  <br>
  In addition, there will be a supplemental allocation of UCRP service credit in the future to individuals employed at UC on Jan. 1, 2001, and who have previously worked for the university in a casual appointment. The details of this element are still being developed and will be announced in the near future.<br>
  <br>
  Also, the university is proposing granting career employment status to casual employees who pass the 1,000-hour threshold. This proposed change must be negotiated with UC unions.<br>
  <b><br>
  Retirement plan improvements<br>
  <br></b> At their May and September meetings, the Regents discussed the possibility of making other improvements to UCRP, including increasing the "age factors" used in determining the amount of monthly retirement benefits faculty and staff receive. However, after consultation and discussions involving Regents and various segments of the UC community, it has been decided that further analysis must be completed on the impact of all the proposals, and that the results of a comprehensive UCRP asset and liability study are needed. UC Human Resources and Benefits expects the retirement age factor proposal to be submitted to the Regents in January 2001.<br>
  <br>
  The Regents did act today to improve the age factors for safety officers -- police and firefighters -- in order to maintain a competitive position with cities and counties the university competes with for talent.<br>
  <br>
  In the previous formula used to calculate a retired safety member's monthly retirement check, the age factor started at .020 at age 50 and increased to a maximum of .025 at age 55. The new retirement improvement sets the retirement age factor at .030 when retiring at age 50 or older, for safety members who retire Jan. 1, 2001, or later.

        <title>To help maintain state's economic growth, UC announces plans to add 11,000 graduate students</title>
        <pubDate>Thu, 16 Nov 2000 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  UC Office of the President In a move designed to maintain its leadership role in California's economy, the University of California announced plans today (November 16) to help meet the state's future workforce needs by adding 11,000 graduate students to the 10-campus UC system over the next decade. "As a high-technology state and innovation leader, California will rely on highly educated workers to provide a competitive advantage in the global marketplace," said Provost and Senior Vice President C. Judson King during a presentation to the UC Board of Regents, which met in Los Angeles. The university will pursue a combination of strategies to attract and retain graduate students in the coming years, including:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>More funding dedicated to research assistantships as research grants and contracts grow, including state-funded research initiatives proposed in the 2001-02 budget;
  </li>
  <li>More funding for teaching assistantships as undergraduate enrollments grow;
  </li>
  <li>Increased fee waivers for research assistants and teaching assistants, consistent with the university's contract with the union representing UC teaching assistants; and
  </li>
  <li>Examination by UC of other opportunities to augment graduate student financial support from other university fund sources, such as student fees and private gifts.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  King also announced the formation of a special commission that will develop strategies to provide more financial support for this graduate enrollment increase. The commission will be chaired by King and S. Sue Johnson, chair of the Board of Regents, and will report its findings by July 1, 2001.<br>
  <br>
  Despite the university's national reputation for excellence in graduate education, enrollment has been virtually level for decades. By comparison, undergraduate enrollment at UC has doubled during the past 30 years. As a consequence, the proportion of graduate students has steadily dropped from 30 percent of total enrollment in 1965 to just 17 percent today.<br>
  <br>
  "The university's percentage of graduate students is considerably lower than the percentages at UC's four public and four private comparison institutions and also is lower than at 11 public university members of the Association of American Universities," said King.<br>
  <br>
  California business leaders endorsed the university's graduate education initiative.<br>
  <br>
  "The University of California must keep pace by increasing graduate education programs to meet industry's thirst for knowledge-based workers," said Tom Burnham, vice president of human resources for Irvine, Calif.-based Allergan. "Failure to do so will diminish California's competitive position in the global economy."<br>
  <br>
  "Industry hires graduates with bachelor's degrees, but they lack two important attributes," said Ted Smith, founder and chairman of FileNet Corp., a $400 million Orange County software company based in Costa Mesa, Calif. "Students without graduate degrees lack experience in doing real design work in disciplined commercial or research organizations. They also lack the training and experience with advanced design tools and methodology taught in advanced degree programs."<br>
  <br>
  In addition to contributing to the California economy, King said that graduate students contribute to the broader society in a number of different ways. For instance, he said, graduate students are needed for their abilities to "think outside the box" in shaping California's future, to replace university faculty who are retiring, and to teach the increasing numbers of undergraduate students who already are arriving at the doors of UC and the California State University system.<br>
  <br>
  He told the Regents that graduate students are highly qualified to meet future state workforce demands because their programs "require intensive study, highly honed analytical skills and original contributions to knowledge that fosters creativity."

  UC Office of the President Sweatshirts produced in a country known for human rights violations have been returned to their licensee after they were found in a University of California at Berkeley bookstore. The return was made under the rules laid down in UC's Code of Conduct for Licensees. "The incident demonstrates that UC's Code of Conduct is working," said Judith Pacult, deputy to Senior Vice President of Business and Finance Joseph Mullinix. "Within hours of my notifying the Cal Student Store buyers that these sweatshirts were discovered in the store, the buyers pulled the products from shelves, other UC campuses were notified, and I started to work with the company that had sent the apparel to find out what had gone wrong," said Maria K. Rubinshteyn, director of the Office of Marketing and Management of Trademarks at UC Berkeley. The merchandise in question--two styles of sweatshirts--was spotted by a photographer with the <i>Daily Cal</i> student newspaper. The apparel bore labels indicating that the garments had been produced in Burma, now known as Myanmar. The material had been produced by JanSport, a company located in Wisconsin that is among the top 10 licensees of apparel for the University of California. JanSport officials notified UC officials that it has so far stopped more than 40,000 units of this product from being distributed to customers and had stopped several shipments from reaching the United States. James Koehne, a JanSport vice president, wrote in a letter received by university officials on Oct. 17 that his company first became aware that merchandise was being produced in Myanmar in June 2000. Their supplier had moved the factory location "without our knowledge and permission" from China to Myanmar, Koehne said in his letter. Despite efforts to isolate and stop shipments of the merchandise, some goods were mixed with goods made in other countries and a few items were missed during audits. "The products received by the Cal Student Store came from these two mistakes," said Koehne. "We hope this letter, along with the recall of all products produced in Myanmar, confirms our commitment to be a responsible vendor," said Koehne. Since the incident, Koehne and other representatives from JanSport have met on the Berkeley campus with university officials to discuss the error. Koehne is also slated to make a presentation at an upcoming meeting of the student/faculty monitoring group, appointed by Mullinix. "Our commitment to fair and humane work standards is strong,""said Mullinix. "We share the students' concern about this issue. We will continue to review our policies and make decisions that will make us a leader among institutions that strive for equitable work standards." In 1998, the University of California became one of the few universities in the country to adopt a code of conduct for its trademark licensees that manufacture products with the university's name. In January 2000, UC issued a strengthened code with input from an advisory group of students, faculty and campus administrators. Another committee of faculty and students has been named to study and make recommendations on enforcement and monitoring issues. UC also has participated in a five-university study of apparel manufacturing in seven countries. The report, the "Independent University Initiative," was released in October 2000.

[caption id="attachment_2737" align="alignright" width="200"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/11/seal.00-11-13.200.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2737" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/11/seal.00-11-13.200.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="150" /></a>[/caption]
<p>
  For years, anthropologist Diane Gifford-Gonzalez was pestered by nagging questions about some marine mammal bones that were part of UCSC's extensive archaeological archive. Why, she wondered, did the collection contain the remains of so many northern fur seals, a species that today is found primarily off Siberia and the Aleutian Islands in Alaska?<br>
  <br>
</p>The northern fur seal, one of the smallest of the eared seals, accounts for fewer than 1 percent of all pinniped strandings along the Central Coast today. But the presence of its bones accounted for about one-third of all sea mammals in local archaeological sites, suggesting to Gifford-Gonzalez that things had been very different some 2,000 years ago.
<p>
  Adding to the mystery was the prevalence of bones on the mainland. Today, the northern fur seal breeds only on islands. Like the California sea lions so abundant around the Monterey Bay Area today, modern northern fur seals give birth and rear their young on offshore islands where they are safe from predators such as grizzly bears, coyotes, mountain lions--and humans.
</p>
<p>
  Gifford-Gonzalez knew from the bones that the distribution of marine mammals around the Monterey Bay Area had undergone dramatic changes in the past 2,000 years. What she didn't know was why.
</p>
<p>
  Her quest for answers took off with the arrival on campus in 1996 of Paul Koch, an associate professor of Earth sciences. Koch is a paleontologist and geochemist who uses bone-chemical analysis to study the diet and environments of different animals. To hear Gifford-Gonzalez tell it, she had been waiting for someone with his expertise for years.
</p>
<p>
  Using the isotope chemistry of fragments of bones taken from the UCSC collection, Koch and his graduate student Robert Burton discovered that the northern fur seals found on the mainland in California were feeding far offshore, along the continental shelf. Furthermore, bone chemistry showed no signs that these animals had ever fed in Alaska. Unlike the northern fur seals found off the California coast today, who mostly swim down from Alaska, the ancient fur seals in Monterey Bay spent the entire year in the waters off California.<br>
</p>
<p>
  More significantly, the team ascertained the precise ages of very young animals at death, and Gifford-Gonzalez confirmed that adult females were birthing and rearing young on the mainland.
</p>
<p>
  The prehistoric presence of mainland seal rookeries triggers a host of interdisciplinary questions that have implications for marine biologists studying the life histories of seals, anthropologists interested in the hunting practices of prehistoric Indians, conservation biologists plotting habitat and species restoration plans, and environmental scientists studying climate change.
</p>
<p>
  Northern fur seals are perhaps best known for their fur, which was prized by hunters in the 1800s. At that time, the seals were breeding on San Miguel Island off the coast of Ventura and on the Farallon Islands 30 miles west of the Golden Gate Bridge, as well as on islands far to the north. Overhunting caused the disappearance of the seals from the Central Coast, and the animals only began to recolonize San Miguel in 1968, said Gifford-Gonzalez. Now, about 5 percent of the population is born on San Miguel, according to Koch.
</p>
<p>
  Long before the coming of the fur trade, however, something made the seals vanish from mainland beaches along the Central Coast. The population appears to have been sufficiently well established that Gifford-Gonzalez and Koch have ruled out the usual suspects: bears, coyotes, and other carnivores.<br>
</p>
<p>
  More likely, they believe, would be human overpredation or climate change--or a combination of the two.
</p>
<p>
  "Natural climate variability could impact the seals directly, or it could make things so terrible for humans on land that they would turn to ocean resources and take more than they had before," said Koch.
</p>
<p>
  When Gifford-Gonzalez and Koch teamed up on the project, they recruited Burton, then a doctoral candidate in Earth sciences and now doing postdoctoral research at Moss Landing Marine Laboratories, and anthropologist Josh Snodgrass, now a doctoral candidate in physical anthropology at Northwestern University, to join them. They collaborated with scientists at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory's Center for Accelerator Mass Spectrometry to obtain radiocarbon dates on the fur seal bones.
</p>
<p>
  Gifford-Gonzalez and Koch are gratified that the results of their small-scale pilot study have generated findings sufficiently provocative to attract support from the National Science Foundation.
</p>
<p>
  With new NSF funding, Gifford-Gonzalez and Koch plan to pinpoint the date of the seal's disappearance and fill in details of the environmental record. Ninety percent of what they need is already in the UCSC archaeology archives, where animal bones, shells, and other artifacts gathered during regional construction projects are stored.
</p>
<p>
  Isotope analysis of mussel shells gathered from the same archaeological sites as the bones will allow Koch to chart changes in ocean conditions, including temperature, salinity, and the intensity of upwelling, which affect food supplies. Eventually, they hope to expand their work to investigate whether the displacement of seals began here and continued north along the California coast into Oregon.
</p>
<p>
  "We want to know what happened to these seals long before the historic period fur trade began," said Gifford-Gonzalez. "It looks like the present distribution of elephant seals, Steller sea lions, and California sea lions could be a result of animals moving in to fill a niche that was opened up by displacement of the northern fur seal. The next phase will try to reveal the cause, whether it was climatic change, prehistoric human predation, or perhaps cascading ecosystem effects."
</p>
<p>
  For Koch, whose typical research subjects range from 250-million-year-old reptilelike mammals to mammals that lived as recently as 10,000 years ago, piecing together the mystery of the northern fur seal is one small part of the enormous task of reconstructing environmental and evolutionary history.
</p>
<p>
  <br>
  "It really does matter a lot why the seals are not here now," said Koch. "If their disappearance is a result of human predation, should we reintroduce them? If it was a result of catastrophic environmental changes, we want to know that, too, because it will give us a sense of how vulnerable the species is to future climatic changes."

<h2>
  <font color="#003399"><b>Let's Be Clear About Affirmative Action</b></font>
</h2>
<p>
  By Faye J. Crosby<br>
  <br>
  When George W. Bush referred to "affirmative access" during the final presidential debate, Vice President Al Gore candidly said he didn't know what that meant. Unlike most Americans, though, Gore does have a clear understanding of affirmative action.
</p>As Bush demonstrated, affirmative action has come to mean different things to different people. Yet research shows that people's ideas of what affirmative action is and how it works shape their reactions to it--more so, even, than their political affiliation, their gender, their race, and their affluence.
<p>
  That's why it's a pity that clear, accurate information is hard to come by. Some opposition to affirmative action is grounded in racial and gender prejudice, mixed with self-interest. But opposition also springs from miseducation.
</p>
<p>
  In employment, affirmative action has been the law of the land since 1965. Today, affirmative action regulations apply to tens of thousands of organizations, including most of the largest employers in the nation. Affirmative action affects one in four employed Americans. Yet virtually no textbook in American civics, politics, or government explains how the law operates.
</p>
<p>
  The gist of the 1965 law is simple: The federal government and all federal contractors above a certain size must be affirmative action employers. A federal contractor is an organization that does business with the federal government. The private organization that does not want to be an affirmative action employer has the option of declining government contracts.
</p>
<p>
  At the core of any affirmative action plan is a comparison between utilization of qualified individuals in designated categories and their availability in the workforce. Designated categories are determined by gender (females) and by ethnicity (African American, Asian American, Latino/a American, Native American). When utilization roughly matches availability, everyone is satisfied. When utilization falls short of availability, corrective actions must be considered.
</p>
<p>
  How is availability determined? The Office of Federal Contract Compliance (OFCC) helps employers determine the figures. So does the nonprofit American Association for Affirmative Action. Companies can now purchase computer programs that calculate the availability of people by category in certain occupations in defined regions.
</p>
<p>
  Political figures from Jesse Jackson to Gerald Ford point out that affirmative action is not about hiring people who fall below the grade. Even Ward Connerly, arch opponent of quotas, has publicly endorsed classical affirmative action.
</p>
<p>
  For many, the rub occurs when a well-qualified candidate from one of the designated groups is hired, retained, or promoted instead of another candidate who seems to be even better qualified. If a man scores 85 on the test, how can it be fair to hire the woman who scores 83?
</p>
<p>
  Tests sometimes contain bias. A raft of research studies document the persistence of bias in both the construction and the administration of numerous screening and other tests. Consider the studies showing that African Americans must meet more stringent requirements for housing mortgages than white Americans. If one has reason to suspect that bias may have crept into a test, then it is only fair to adjust the scores to correct for the bias.
</p>
<p>
  Moreover, diversity in talents and backgrounds is usually important to organizational vigor. When affirmative action operates through monitoring and correction, slow steady progress is made for women workers and for ethnic minorities. Economists have documented the progress. Economists have also documented that affirmative action employers are more profitable than comparison organizations.
</p>
<p>
  If considerations of fairness are important in employment situations, they are absolutely vital to the educational enterprise, especially in public education. Admission to the best universities is a matter of competition, especially for professional schools. It can feel galling when a white student with good grades and high test scores is refused admission to a law school while a competent student of color with lower scores is admitted. But if the school knows that it disproportionately admits white students and if it has reason to suspect bias in the educational system, the school may devise and deploy race-sensitive admissions procedures to assure diversity in the student body.
</p>
<p>
  A diverse student body benefits everyone. Some benefit is immediate: An important study at the University of Michigan shows that students in diverse educational settings think more creatively than students in homogeneous groups.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Some of the benefits are longterm. The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation sponsored a study of more than 80,000 students from 28 elite colleges and universities in 1951, 1976, and 1989, and contrasted the fates of ethnic minority students who were "special admits" with other students. The "special admits" differed in only one salient regard: Decades after graduation, they are more likely than their white counterparts to be active civic leaders. William Bowen and Derek Bok, authors of the study, note that universities, especially public universities, exist for the public good and conclude that race-sensitive admission policies are fairer to the nation than the supposed race-neutral policies advocated by the foes of affirmative action.
</p>
<p>
  Affirmative action is still needed in America. Statistics demonstrate that women still earn less than comparable men and that people of color earn less than their pale-skinned counterparts. No one favors discrimination or special privilege. In a truly great democracy, education and accurate information should play a greater role in political decisions than do polemics.<br>

        <title>Professor Russell Flegal receives Outstanding Faculty Award from Division of Natural Sciences</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 13 Nov 2000 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_2730" align="alignright" width="155"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/11/flegal_russ.00-11-13.155.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2730" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/11/flegal_russ.00-11-13.155.jpg" alt="Russell Flegal.

<p>
  The Division of Natural Sciences has awarded Russell Flegal, professor and chair of the Environmental Toxicology Department, its Outstanding Faculty Award for 1999-2000.
</p>The award recognizes Flegal's commitment to service, teaching excellence, and distinguished research career, said dean of natural sciences David Kliger.<br>
<br>
"He is an extremely respected scientist who is held in high regard by his colleagues for his excellence in research, teaching, and service," Kliger said. "He is truly an important asset to our local community, campus, and the Division of Natural Sciences."<br>
<br>
Flegal received his Ph.D. in oceanography from Oregon State University in 1979, then worked as a research scientist at the California Institute of Technology. He came to UCSC as a research geochemist in 1985 and joined the faculty as a professor of Earth sciences in 1992. He has served as associate dean of natural sciences since 1994 and has also served on numerous faculty committees.<br>
<br>
Flegal's service to campus and community includes active involvement in a wide range of programs. In 1997, he became regional director of the California Alliance for Minority Participation in Science, Engineering, and Mathematics (CAMP), a statewide program that supports and encourages undergraduates from underrepresented minorities to complete the B.S. degree. Each summer, Flegal meets with and lectures to students in the program, and many of the students work in Flegal's laboratory for several years under his direction. Flegal is also involved in overseeing a collaborative summer program with Cabrillo College. The program selects 25 community college students to participate for two weeks each summer in workshops to improve their math and science skills in preparation for transfer to a four-year institution.<br>
<br>
Flegal has also developed new teaching programs on campus. He spearheaded the development and implementation of an academic graduate degree program in environmental toxicology, which was recognized as a new department this year by the UC Office of the President.<br>
<br>
As a teacher, Flegal consistently receives outstanding student evaluations, which often describe him as a dynamic, well-prepared instructor. His evaluations are replete with statements attesting to his breadth of knowledge and his ability to actively engage students. In addition to classroom teaching, Flegal supervises a large number of graduate students. As a credit to his teaching, all of his students have found employment in their fields on completion of their degrees.<br>
<br>
Flegal is also a very productive scientist, maintaining an active research program that investigates a broad range of topics involving biogeochemistry of metal contaminants in aquatic and human environments. His research has many societal applications and often relates directly to state and federal policy issues. He has worked, pro bono, with the California Attorney General's Office in class-action environmental litigations for the past decade. He has also given many presentations at workshops in the service of state and national environmental agencies.<br>
<br>
Flegal maintains a world-class analytic facility that has exceptional capabilities for measuring trace element concentrations and stable lead isotope compositions. As a result of these superior capabilities, his laboratory has been selected by the National Science Foundation to accurately document trace element contamination in the world's oceans.<br>
<br>
The Division of Natural Sciences established the Outstanding Faculty Award in 1993 to honor excellence in service to the campus and community, teaching, and research. Recipients are selected by a committee made up of divisional department chairs.

        <title>UCSC hosts top economists at third annual conference</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 13 Nov 2000 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>2729</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  Prominent international economists gathered on campus recently for the third annual SCCIE International Economics Conference, where research in the areas of international finance and trade was presented. Sponsored by the <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/cgirs/sccie/">Santa Cruz Center for International Economics</a> (SCCIE), the conference November 3-4 included a series of workshops that attracted about 50 participants, including graduate students. Topics included:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>trade and global warming
  </li>
  <li>budget policy and currency crises
  </li>
  <li>an evaluation of intellectual property rights agreements enforced by the World Trade Organization
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  SCCIE's goal is to sponsor research and seminars on key policy issues in international economics. Its members include international economists from the UCSC Economics Department, as well as members of other departments on campus, graduate students, and affiliated research associates.<br>
  <br>
  "Our objective is to become one of the world's leading institutions in the field of international economics," said SCCIE coordinator Michael Hutchison, one of four economics professors who are codirectors of the center. "We want to study policy issues that are important to the state of California and to international economics generally."<br>
  <br>
  The center is poised to hire two more economists this year and to expand its programs, added Hutchison.<br>
  <br>
  In addition to the annual conference, SCCIE activities include workshops, sponsorship of a seminar series, publication of working papers, and hosting prominent visitors to campus. Recent workshops focused on the World Trade Organization and on international labor issues.<br>
  <br>
  SCCIE also cosponsors, with UC San Diego, the West Coast Japan Economic Seminar. Activities are coordinated closely with the Economics Department and the doctoral program in international economics. SCCIE is also working with College Nine, which has an international studies theme, to offer undergraduate research awards in the area of international studies.<br>
  <br>
  "As a research institute, SCCIE is in a position to involve more graduate and undergraduate students and to bring more visiting scholars to campus," said Hutchison. "We look forward to developing our programs and expanding our impact, both on campus and off."<br>
  <br>
  Hutchison is joined in administering the center by fellow economics professors Michael Dooley, K. C. Fung, and Nirvikar Singh. Hutchison and Singh share research interests that focus on international trade issues, while Hutchison and Dooley have expertise in international finance.

  UC Office of the President The University of California and Coalition of University Employees (CUE) have reached a tentative agreement on a first contract for the clerical and allied services bargaining unit. The tentative agreement provides wage increases for 1999-2000, 2000-2001 and 2001-2002 budget years. The contract would expire September 30, 2001. The university's 2001-02 proposed budget, which will be presented to the UC Board of Regents during the week of November 13-17, includes an additional augmentation for staff salaries that lag behind the market averages. The UC-CUE tentative wage agreement for clerical staff includes the following:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Effective 10-1-99--2.8 percent salary range adjustment.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Effective 10-1-99--Regular merit increase for eligible employees.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Effective 7-1-00--2 percent salary range adjustment.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Effective 10-1-00--2 percent salary range adjustment.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Effective 10-1-00--Regular merit increase for eligible employees.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Effective 10-1-00--An additional step to the maximum of the salary range.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Effective 9-1-01--1 percent salary range adjustment.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Plus $100 to each career employee on the date both parties sign the agreement.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  CUE represents approximately 18,000 clerical employees at UC.<br>
  <br>
  During the week of October 30-November 3, UC also reached tentative contract agreements with three other unions. On October 30, UC and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) reached a tentative agreement for 2000-01 wages and a new Veterans Day holiday for the service employees unit. Moreover, on November 6, UC reached a similar agreement with the AFSCME patient care technical unit.<br>
  <br>
  UC and the Federated University Police Officer Association (FUPOA) reached a tentative agreement for UC police officers on October 27 on 2000-01 wages and increasing family sick leave for officers.<br>
  <br>
  "We are very pleased to have reached tentative contract agreements in these four negotiations," said Judith W. Boyette, UC associate vice president for human resources and benefits. "We are particularly proud to have reached our first tentative agreement with CUE on the clerical unit contract. Many of these contracts contain the first steps in a multi-year plan to bring our employees' salaries up to market averages."

        <title>Inoperative mercury mines fingered as a major source of mercury contamination in California waters</title>

The New Idria mercury mine near Pinnacles National Monument is one of dozens of inoperative mercury mines in the Coast Ranges of California. It had one of the longest periods of operation (from 1854 to 1972) and was the second largest mercury producer in North America. Now, UCSC researchers have measured significant amounts of toxic mercury leaching into a creek that flows past the mine site.<br>
<br>
The mercury appears to be coming not from the mine tunnels but from the extensive piles of mine tailings on the site, said Priya Ganguli, lead author of the study, which was published in the current issue of the journal Environmental Science and Technology. Ganguli, who performed the research as a graduate student at UCSC, is currently an environmental specialist with the San Francisco Regional Water Quality Control Board.<br>
<br>
The findings have implications far beyond New Idria, said Russell Flegal, professor and chair of environmental toxicology and a coauthor of the study. Preliminary results from other mine sites indicate that inoperative mercury mines are a major source of mercury pollution in bodies of water such as San Francisco Bay that consistently exceed water quality standards for the toxic element, Flegal said. Methylmercury, the most hazardous form of the element, is a potent neurotoxin that has begun to get increased scrutiny from health scientists and regulatory agencies.<br>
<br>
"Methylmercury is dangerous because it enters the food chain and accumulates in fish, which can end up having concentrations of mercury in their tissues a million times higher than in the surrounding water," Flegal said.<br>
<br>
State health officials have issued fish consumption advisories due to mercury pollution for more than a dozen bodies of water in California, including San Francisco Bay and several areas in the Coast Ranges.<br>
<br>
At the New Idria site, San Carlos Creek is stained bright orange from iron oxides carried in acidic water that drains out of the mine. The creek flows northward, ultimately draining to an area near the Mendota Wildlife Refuge at the headwaters of the San Joaquin River. Ganguli analyzed mercury concentrations in the acid mine drainage as well as in samples collected from the creek upstream and downstream from the mine. The researchers measured total mercury concentrations, as well as the concentrations of specific forms of mercury, including methylmercury and elemental mercury.<br>
<br>
"Total mercury concentrations in the acid mine drainage were comparable to concentrations upstream from the mine, but downstream from the mine there were much higher concentrations," Ganguli said. "Based on where the highest concentrations are, we think the primary source of the mercury is runoff from the mine waste piles alongside the creek."<br>
<br>
At New Idria and other California mercury mines, the mercury was extracted from cinnabar ore in a process called calcination. This involved crushing the ore and roasting it to release elemental mercury, leaving behind waste rock known as calcine. Invariably, the calcine waste still contains some soluble mercury that may leach into surface water and flow into the creek, Ganguli said. Certain types of bacteria convert elemental mercury (the silvery liquid metal used in thermometers) into methylmercury, although the conversion can also occur without microbial activity.<br>
<br>
The researchers calculated a conservative estimate of 1.5 kilograms (a little over 3 pounds) of mercury entering San Carlos Creek from the New Idria mine each year. But Ganguli noted that this is a baseline figure that does not account for potentially large inputs during heavy rains. The annual mercury load from the mine site could be more than ten times higher than this preliminary estimate, she said.<br>
<br>
An important question not answered by this study is how far the mercury travels downstream from the mine. Studies in other locations have shown that metals from acid mine drainage can travel hundreds of miles downstream from their source, so it is possible that some of the mercury from the New Idria mine flows down the San Joaquin River into San Francisco Bay. But Ganguli said the amount that gets to the bay is probably insignificant compared to mercury inputs from sources much closer to the bay, such as the New Almaden mine in the Santa Cruz Mountains near San Jose.<br>
<br>
Substantial amounts of mercury are entering the Guadalupe River from the New Almaden mercury mine, according to Khalil Abu-Saba, a coauthor of the New Idria paper and, like Ganguli, a former graduate student in Flegal's lab and now an environmental specialist for the Regional Water Quality Control Board. Abu-Saba, who is working on regulations to control mercury pollution in San Francisco Bay, said he is convinced that the New Almaden mine is the biggest ongoing source of mercury in the bay.<br>
<br>
In addition to Ganguli, Abu-Saba, and Flegal, the paper's authors include Robert Anderson, professor of Earth sciences, and Robert Mason from the Center for Environmental Studies at the University of Maryland.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_2723" align="alignright" width="155"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/11/pastor.00-11-06.155.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2723" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/11/pastor.00-11-06.155.jpg" alt="Manuel Pastor Photo: r.r.jones" width="155" height="216" /></a>Manuel Pastor Photo: r.r.jones[/caption]
With interests as diverse as community development and Latin American economics, Manuel Pastor, professor of Latin American and Latino studies, works simultaneously on multiple projects. This year, two major ones have come to fruition with the publication of two new books.<br>
<br>
Pastor is coauthor of the new book <i>Regions That Work: How Cities and Suburbs Can Grow Together,</i> and he coedited <i>Modern Political Economy and Latin America: Theory and Policy.</i><br>
<br>
<i>Regions That Work</i> offers a new vision of community-based regionalism that emphasizes equity. The authors argue that metropolitan areas must reduce poverty in order to grow and that low-income individuals must make regional connections in order to escape poverty. Their analysis of Los Angeles demonstrates that the roots of the unrest of 1992 lay in regional economic deterioration and that the recovery was slowed by insufficient attention to the poor.<br>
<br>
The book provides a history and critique of community-development corporations, a statistical analysis of the poverty-growth relationship in 74 metropolitan areas, a detailed study of three regions that have produced superior equity outcomes, and a provocative call for new policies and new politics.<br>
<br>
Harvard sociologist William Julius Wilson has given the book rave reviews. "This is a remarkable and timely book," he said. "A number of scholars and policy analysts have argued the case for uniting city and suburb. However, no study provides more compelling arguments for regional economic integration."<br>
<br>
Pastor, director of the UCSC Center for Justice, Tolerance, and Community, was joined on the project by Peter Dreier, the E. P. Clapp Distinguished Professor of Politics at Occidental College and director of the Urban & Environmental Policy Program; J. Eugene Grigsby III, director of the Advanced Policy Institute and professor at UCLA's School of Public Policy and Social Research; and Marta Lopez-Garza, an assistant professor of women's studies and Chicano/Chicana studies at California State University, Northridge. The book is part of the Globalization and Community Series published by the University of Minnesota Press.<br>
<br>
Pastor's second book of the year, <i>Modern Political Economy and Latin America: Theory and Policy</i> (Boulder, CO: Perseus Books, 2000), consists of carefully selected readings in Latin American political economy. Pastor, along with coeditors Jeffry Frieden of Harvard University and Michael Tomz of Stanford University, include an introductory chapter and a concluding article, as well as brief introductions to each section.<br>
<br>
The publication of the book is well-timed, as Latin American economies undergo profound transformations. In the wake of the decade-long debt crisis that has plagued Latin America, reliance on the market is increasing and authoritarian rule is giving way to new or reborn democratic institutions. The field of Latin American studies needs to be brought up to date with recent developments in theoretical economics and political science.<br>
<br>
Pastor, whose background is in economics, has focused on such issues as distribution and stabilization, the political economy of trade reform, and the dynamics of transition in Cuba. Frieden, a professor of government at Harvard, specializes in the politics of international monetary and financial relations. Tomz, an assistant professor of political science at Stanford, specializes in relations between sovereign governments and foreign creditors during the 19th and 20th centuries.

  <b>Donald Smith,</b> associate professor of environmental toxicology, was quoted by a <i>San Jose Mercury News</i> reporter who sought his comments on a study suggesting that Beethoven suffered from lead poisoning based on an analysis of the composer's hair. Smith said the conclusions were interesting if true, but noted that it would be hard to prove that the hair sample was not contaminated with lead from an external source.

  <b>Peggy Downes Baskin</b> of women's studies was interviewed by TV Channel 7 in Philadelphia about the concept of mentoring into mid-life in conjunction with her participation in a national conference on The Spirit of Women, which took place in Philadelphia.

        <title>Mail ballot at UCSC reaffirms earlier grades vote</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 06 Nov 2000 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  The members of the Academic Senate at UC Santa Cruz, polled via a mail ballot this fall, have reaffirmed an earlier vote implementing UC's conventional grading system. The results of the most recent vote were announced in late October by senate chair Roger Anderson.<br>
  <br>
  The grading legislation continues to permit UCSC undergraduate students to take courses on a Pass/No Pass (P/NP) basis. But, beginning with new undergraduates entering in fall 2001, no more than 25 percent of the UCSC course work that they apply toward graduation credit can be taken on a P/NP basis. No such threshold will exist for current students or new students entering UCSC before then.<br>
  <br>
  In the mail-ballot tally released October 30, 240 senators voted in favor of changing UCSC's grading system; 154 opposed the legislation.<br>
  <br>
  A mail ballot, which can be requested following an in-session vote in order to secure the sentiment of the entire senate membership, had been sought by 27 senators following the senate's meeting last February. At that meeting, the senate voted 154-77 for the grading legislation. The mail ballots were first distributed to senators last spring. But the returned ballots were never tallied because a senate committee determined that the mail ballot language differed slightly from the legislation that had been voted on at the meeting.<br>
  <br>
  The language of the mail ballot was subsequently rewritten, and ballots were distributed to senate members earlier this month.<br>
  <br>
  The grading legislation that has been adopted does not affect UCSC's current requirement that narrative evaluations be written for all students in all courses. Still pending before the senate as unfinished business, however, is legislation proposed in a special meeting last December that would make the writing of "narratives" optional for faculty.
</p>

<p>
  The discussion of UCSC's Narrative Evaluation System will resume at a special meeting of the senate, scheduled for November 27; the senate's regular fall meeting will take place on November 9.

        <title>UCSC hosts statewide conference for beginning teachers</title>

        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  For the first time, beginning teachers from across the state have the opportunity to meet for a daylong professional conference that will offer tips on issues such as classroom management, curriculum development, student assessment, and technology, all in the context of recognizing and celebrating the contributions new teachers make to schools.
</p>

<p>
  UCSC's New Teacher Center is inviting all new teachers in California to attend the gathering, "In Celebration of New Teachers: The Key to the Future," on Saturday, November 18, at the San Mateo Marriott Hotel in San Mateo. Cost is $85 per person, which includes two meals, refreshments, and entry to all sessions and the postconference reception. Space is limited, and advance registration is required; no on-site registration will be available. Register on the web at <a href="http://www.newteachercenter.org/btc.html">www.newteachercenter.org/btc.html</a>, or call Peggy Young at (831) 459-4323 or (831) 454-9749 for more information.<br>
</p>

<p>
  Keynote addresses will be delivered by Crystal A. Kuykendall and Ellen Moir. Kuykendall, whose talk is titled, "The Key to Bringing Out the Best in All Students," is an expert on student motivation, equality and equity in education, and teacher behaviors that support the achievement of all students. She began her career as a classroom teacher and has held positions as a university instructor, executive director of the National Alliance of Black School Educators, and director of urban and minority relations for the National School Boards Association. She was appointed by President Jimmy Carter as chairperson of the National Advisory Council on Continuing Education and is the author of four books, including <i>From Rage to Hope: Strategies for Reclaiming Black and Hispanic Students.</i><br>
</p>

<p>
  Moir is the executive director of the New Teacher Center at UC Santa Cruz. "Luckily, we are starting to recognize that great teachers are not born but developed over time," said Moir. "There's a lot we can do to facilitate that development, and we need to recognize that good teachers need time, careful training, and ongoing support to become the mentors for the next generation of beginning teachers."<br>
</p>

<p>
  During the conference, more than two dozen concurrent professional development sessions will address the needs and interests of teachers at the elementary and secondary levels. Topics will include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>enhancing the classroom environment
  </li>
  <li>increasing parental involvement
  </li>
  <li>making algebra accessible
  </li>
  <li>integrating science and language development for English language learners
  </li>
  <li>narrowing the literacy gap for secondary students
  </li>
  <li>intervention strategies that build resiliency in students
  </li>
  <li>bringing history and social science to life
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  The day will end with a closing celebration and a reception with entertainment. For a full schedule of events, visit the conference web site at <a href="http://www.newteachercenter.org/btc.html">www.newteachercenter.org/btc.html</a>.<br>

  The Northern California chapter of the Achievement Rewards for College Scientists (ARCS) Foundation has provided $80,000 in scholarships this year for ten UCSC students. The 2000 ARCS scholars were honored at the foundation's annual luncheon last month at the St. Francis Hotel in San Francisco. The ARCS Foundation is a national organization that provides scholarships and fellowships for the country's most promising science, medical, and engineering students. The foundation is the most generous provider of annual student awards to the UCSC campus. The 2000 ARCS scholars represent the Science Communication Program and the Departments of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Computer Science, Earth Sciences, Ocean Sciences, and Physics. Six UCSC graduate students received $10,000 ARCS scholarships: Anouk Shambrook and Kurtis Williams (astronomy and astrophysics); Terrence Furey (computer science); Glenn Spinelli (Earth sciences); Myra Finkelstein (ocean sciences); and Joshua Gray (physics). Four students in the Science Communication Program each received a $5,000 ARCS scholarship, which was matched by a donation from a private donor.

        <title>Mail ballot at UCSC reaffirms earlier grades vote</title>
        <pubDate>Tue, 31 Oct 2000 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>

        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  The members of the Academic Senate at UC Santa Cruz, polled via a mail ballot this fall, have reaffirmed an earlier vote implementing UC's conventional grading system. The results of the most recent vote were announced late yesterday by senate chair Roger Anderson.<br>
  <br>
  The grading legislation continues to permit UCSC undergraduate students to take courses on a Pass/No Pass (P/NP) basis. But, beginning with new undergraduates entering in fall 2001, no more than 25 percent of the UCSC course work that they apply toward graduation credit can be taken on a P/NP basis. No such threshold will exist for current students or new students entering UCSC before then.<br>
  <br>
  In the mail-ballot tally released October 30, 240 senators voted in favor of changing UCSC's grading system; 154 opposed the legislation.<br>
  <br>
  A mail ballot, which can be requested following an in-session vote in order to secure the sentiment of the entire senate membership, had been sought by 27 senators following the senate's meeting last February. At that meeting, the senate voted 154-77 for the grading legislation. The mail ballots were first distributed to senators last spring. But the returned ballots were never tallied because a senate committee determined that the mail ballot language differed slightly from the legislation that had been voted on at the meeting.<br>
  <br>
  The language of the mail ballot was subsequently rewritten, and ballots were distributed to senate members earlier this month.<br>
  <br>
  The grading legislation that has been adopted does not affect UCSC's current requirement that narrative evaluations be written for all students in all courses. Still pending before the senate as unfinished business, however, is legislation proposed in a special meeting last December that would make the writing of "narratives" optional for faculty.
</p>

<p>
  The discussion of UCSC's Narrative Evaluation System will resume at a special meeting of the senate, scheduled for November 27; the senate's regular fall meeting will take place on November 9.

        <title>Tesla coil demonstration makes science lessons shockingly fun</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_2716" align="alignright" width="180"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/10/tesla.00-10-30.200.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2716" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/10/tesla.00-10-30.200.jpg" alt="Daniel Greenhouse demonstrates one of the cool special effects that can be achieved with a Tesla coil--arcs of electricity breaking out of his fingertips.

Daniel Greenhouse, a senior physics and math major, thinks learning about science should be fun. He began experimenting with electricity when he was 12 years old, and before long he was building Tesla coils that could generate huge arcs of electricity. This led to special-effects projects for concerts by the Grateful Dead and Phish.
<p>
  More recently, Greenhouse helped a group of UCSC physics faculty and local high school teachers develop a physics demonstration for use in high school science classes.<br>
  <br>
  The demonstration, involving such electrifying sights as a five-foot bolt of electricity striking a person in a metal suit, is part of the educational outreach activities of the Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics (SCIPP). The visual spectacle of the exhibit provides an attention-grabbing context for teaching a range of basic concepts about the power of electromagnetic fields.<br>
  <br>
  "I've always been interested in using electronic devices to get people excited about science," Greenhouse said. "I love seeing someone's eyes open wide in wonder."<br>
  <br>
  The demonstration was developed as part of SCIPP's summer research associates program, which brings high school teachers into the SCIPP labs for hands-on research experience. Teachers from local schools in Santa Cruz and Watsonville were among those involved in the project, along with UCSC physics faculty and staff.<br>
  <br>
  The first public demonstration was held in July at Aptos High School's summer session. Hartmut Sadrozinski, adjunct professor of physics and coordinator of SCIPP's summer research program, said the response has been tremendous.<br>
  <br>
  "You could see from the expressions on the students' faces that they were really impressed," Sadrozinski said.<br>
  <br>
  He plans to bring the demonstration to other local high schools as well as to schools in San Jose and San Francisco. The next scheduled exhibition will be at Independence High School in San Jose in November. A video crew from a German television station is planning to tape that event, Sadrozinski said. The demonstration is also being used in SCIPP's one-day physics workshops for high school teachers.<br>
  <br>
  At the heart of the demonstration is a Tesla coil, a device invented in the 1890s by Nikola Tesla. Tesla was a brilliant scientist and inventor whose inventions include the alternating-current (AC) power system used to supply electrical power throughout the world. Tesla coils are the most effective means of producing ultra-high voltages and can generate impressive arcs of electricity similar to lightning bolts.<br>
  <br>
  Greenhouse built his first Tesla coil with a little help from his father when he was in seventh grade. In 1997, he went into business building and selling Tesla coils and other special-effects devices and performing demonstrations. The coil he built for SCIPP is one of the smaller ones his company offers. The largest can generate arcs 17 feet long.<br>
  <br>
  "These kinds of demonstrations show that science can be really fun, and it's also really fascinating when you understand how it works," Greenhouse said. "There is a lot of fun to be had that is instructive."<br>
  <br>
  SCIPP's outreach programs are supported by the UCSC Educational Partnership Center and agencies that fund research projects at SCIPP, including the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy.<br>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  NASA Administrator Daniel Goldin and University of California President Richard Atkinson have announced an historic partnership to create a world-class educational research-and-development campus focusing on innovation and scientific discovery. The campus will be located at the proposed NASA Research Park in Silicon Valley.<br>
  <br>
  The announcement was made during a news conference October 25 at NASA Ames Research Center at Moffett Field.<br>
  <br>
  "The innovations and scientific discoveries of the future will not come from NASA, industry or universities alone. They will come from us working together and making the most of the special attributes that each of us brings to the table," Goldin said.
</p>

<p>
  "I am delighted that NASA Ames, which has critical R&D responsibilities in information technology, biotechnology, and nanotechnology, is partnering with one of the world's best public higher education systems. This partnership with UC will enhance the ability of NASA to deliver the technologies necessary for the achievement of the nation's goals in space and aeronautics, and allow America to lead and have an impact on every facet of science and technology."<br>
  <br>
  "UC and NASA scientists will work together on advances in science and technology that will drive new industries and provide new products benefiting California's economy," said Atkinson. "UC Santa Cruz will serve as a portal to the UC system for Silicon Valley to connect UC's intellectual resources with the specific interests and needs of Silicon Valley, NASA, the state, and the nation."<br>
  <br>
  "Our goal is to develop a world-class, shared-use R&D campus by partnering with industry, academia, and nonprofits in the NASA Research Park," said NASA Ames Research Center Director Dr. Henry McDonald. "Our collaborative research with UC will include information technology, biotechnology, planetary sciences, nanotechnology, astrobiology, and education. We hope to develop unique new laboratories and research funding opportunities with our NASA Research Park partners to pursue revolutionary new technologies and to develop new ideas to improve the region's education infrastructure."<br>
  <br>
  "This partnership will foster a world-class center for education and for research and development. Our plans include the creation and testing of new models for delivering education and conducting research that capitalize on Silicon Valley technology and the rich math and science environment at NASA Ames Research Center," added UCSC Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood. "Through the establishment of the UC Santa Cruz Silicon Valley Center at the proposed NASA Research Park and our recently announced 'Collaborative' with San Jose State University and Foothill-DeAnza Community College District, we will provide education programs that will work to bridge the digital divide and address Silicon Valley's workforce needs," Greenwood said.<br>
  <br>
  The agreement between the parties refers to a Preliminary Land Use Plan for the NASA Research Park that reserves a 40-acre site for university partners, with 25 acres assured for UC in furtherance of collaborations in education, research, and public service.
</p>

<p>
  UC plans to build a minimum of 600,000 square feet of new construction in the research park and to have at least 2,000 students attending classes by the end of their 10-year build-out period. UC and NASA agreed to explore the construction of housing to be provided by UC for students, staff, and faculty.<br>
  <br>
  NASA Ames Research Center recently announced the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) process under the National Environmental Policy Act regulations to develop the land at Moffett Field under NASA ownership. The proposed developments include the area called the NASA Research Park in which the academic, industry, and nonprofit partners hope to conduct their collaborative research and education programs.
</p>

<p>
  The University of California is conducting a similar environmental process under state law, the Environmental Impact Report (EIR). Upon the successful completion of both the EIS and EIR, a Land Use Agreement will be signed and construction will begin.<br>

A rare species of succulent that grows only on California's Channel Islands has a better chance of surviving in the wild now, thanks in part to the efforts of UCSC Arboretum staff. As an added benefit, succulent fans can now buy the hard-to-find plants at the Arboretum's annual Dried Flower and Succulent Sale this weekend, November 4 and 5.<br>
<br>
By offering garden-grown plants of the rare succulent, known informally as the Munchkin Dudleya, to the public, the Arboretum hopes to discourage collectors from harming the few remaining wild plants. Protection of the plants in their natural habitat was set in motion several years ago by Arboretum botanist Stephen McCabe, who gave the plant its scientific name, <i>Dudleya gnoma.</i><br>
<br>
<i>Dudleya gnoma</i> was originally discovered on Santa Rosa Island in 1950 by Reid Moran of the San Diego Museum of Natural History. Moran found the plants growing in a 30- by 80-foot area on the island, then privately owned and operated as a cattle ranch, but he did not formally name the plant as a new species. The National Park Service bought the island in 1986 and it is now part of Channel Islands National Park. In 1993, McCabe joined park botanist Sarah Chaney to look for the plants Moran had discovered.<br>
<br>
McCabe and Chaney found the original population of Munchkin Dudleyas, as well as two nearby subpopulations. But they were dismayed to find that cattle had uprooted large numbers of them. About 10 percent of the 3,400 plants in the total population had been uprooted. Further exploration did not uncover any additional populations.<br>
<br>
McCabe then began the lengthy process, including careful research, needed to assign the plant a scientific name so that it could be recognized as a unique species and granted legal protection. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, hearing of McCabe's intentions to publish a formal description of the species, started the process of listing it as an endangered species. And researchers with the National Biological Survey began studying the population size and reproductive success of the Munchkin Dudleyas.<br>
<br>
As the evidence mounted that the plants were in need of protection, the National Park Service decided to fence off the populations to keep cattle from trampling them. Eventually, the Park Service removed all of the cattle from Santa Rosa Island to protect other endangered species on the island in addition to the Munchkin Dudleyas. After the threat from cattle had been removed, the Fish and Wildlife Service decided not to list McCabe's new species as endangered after all.<br>
<br>
Currently, the main threat to the Munchkin Dudleya is from potential collecting by hobbyists. The best way to head off this threat is to make garden-grown plants more widely available, McCabe said.
<p>
  The Munchkin Dudleya has been available periodically at specialists' shows since Moran collected it in 1950, but it has not been easy to find. The UCSC Arboretum is now selling garden-grown cuttings from the original 1950 collections at its annual Dried Flower and Succulent Sale.<br>
  <br>
  The sale will take place at the Arboretum on November 4 and 5, from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. both days. The Arboretum is located on Empire Grade one-half mile from the main entrance to campus at Bay and High Streets.<br>
  <br>
  The UCSC Arboretum is open daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. The Arboretum gift shop, Norrie's Gifts, is open Tuesdays through Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., and Sundays, 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. The Jean and Bill Lane Horticultural Library is open Wednesdays through Sundays, 1 p.m. to 4 p.m.<br>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  The Northern California chapter of the Achievement Rewards for College Scientists (ARCS) Foundation has provided $80,000 in scholarships this year for ten UCSC students. The 2000 ARCS scholars were honored at the foundation's annual luncheon last week at the St. Francis Hotel in San Francisco. The ARCS Foundation is a national organization that provides scholarships and fellowships for the country's most promising science, medical, and engineering students. The foundation is the most generous provider of annual student awards to the UCSC campus. The 2000 ARCS scholars represent the Science Communication Program and the Departments of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Computer Science, Earth Sciences, Ocean Sciences, and Physics. Six UCSC graduate students received $10,000 ARCS scholarships: Anouk Shambrook and Kurtis Williams (astronomy and astrophysics); Terrence Furey (computer science); Glenn Spinelli (Earth sciences); Myra Finkelstein (ocean sciences); and Joshua Gray (physics). Four students in the Science Communication Program each received a $5,000 ARCS scholarship, which was matched by a donation from a private donor.

[caption id="attachment_2705" align="alignright" width="109"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/10/cas.00-10-30.gif"><img class="size-full wp-image-2705" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/10/cas.00-10-30.gif" alt="" width="109" height="50" /></a>[/caption]
From a biologist who studies the nearshore marine environment to an ecologist who has championed the use of rigorous statistical research methods, four UCSC faculty members have been inducted as new fellows of the <a href="http://web.calacademy.org/">California Academy of Sciences</a>.
<p>
  The academy is governed by the Fellows, a distinguished group of eminent scientists appointed in recognition of their notable contributions to one or more of the natural sciences. Nominated by their colleagues and appointed by the Board of Trustees, the Fellows remain members of the Fellowship for life. The UCSC researchers are among 19 new fellows who were inducted October 14. They are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Laurel Fox,</b> professor of ecology and evolutionary biology
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Marc Mangel</b>, professor of environmental studies
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Peter T. Raimondi</b>, associate professor of ecology and evolutionary biology
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Barry Sinervo</b>, associate professor of ecology and evolutionary biology
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Fox's research focuses on fundamental questions of ecology that address how interactions among species shape community dynamics and structure. Her recent work emphasizes how disturbances, including anthropogenic effects, modify coastal terrestrial communities, as well as the ecology and management of rare plant species. Her work has played an important role in the development of the Monterey Bay Regional Studies Program, which is based at UCSC. She has also been director of the ecology program at the National Science Foundation.
</p>
<p>
  Mangel's work concentrates on the ecological implications of natural variation within populations of organisms. He specializes in salmonid and krill life histories and insect-plant interactions. He is best known for the development of "dynamic modeling" as a tool for studying life-history patterns. He has served on the Committee of Scientific Advisors of the U.S. Marine Mammal Commission and on the Scientific Advisory Board of the National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis, and he has held Guggenheim and Fulbright Fellowships.
</p>
<p>
  Raimondi's research goal is to broadly understand the factors that are important in the development and maintenance of biological communities. His most recent research efforts have concentrated on the Partnership for Interdisciplinary Study of Coastal Oceans (PISCO), a collaborative program of four West Coast universities. This project includes studies of the contribution of oceanographic processes, larval dispersal, larval behavior, and post-settlement processes to nearshore subtidal and intertidal communities, including the population dynamics of barnacles, corals, and giant kelp.
</p>
<p>
  Sinervo is an internationally recognized leader in behavioral and evolutionary ecology. His research integrates mechanistic analyses of behavior and physiology with classic comparative and theoretical approaches to evolution. He has founded the new field of allometric engineering that incorporates ecological theory with population biology, behavior, physiology, endocrinology, population genetics and evolution, reproductive biology, and developmental biology.<br>

        <title>Too close to call: Why presidential polls can't predict the winner</title>

<p>
  <i>(This opinion piece first appeared in <a href="http://Alternet.org/">Alternet</a>)</i>
</p>
<p>
  By Harry G. Levine and Craig Reinarman
</p>
<p>
  Four years ago, on October 27, 2000, CNN reported that polls from <i>Time,</i> Gallup, ABC News, <i>USA Today,</i> and the <i>Washington Post</i> found that Bush was ahead in the popular vote. Some said Bush had a "solid advantage."
</p>
<p>
  <i>Republican presidential nominee George W. Bush holds a 49-to-43 percent edge over Democratic rival Al Gore in the latest CNN/Time poll.... The poll of 2,060 adult Americans ... is thus in essential agreement with a CNN/USA Today/Gallup tracking poll also released Friday. That poll gives Bush a 52 percent [to] 39 percent edge over Gore. More important, both polls show the same snapshot of the current state of the presidential campaign: a solid advantage for Bush. ABC News and the Washington Post both have daily tracking polls today putting the race at 48 percent for Bush and 45 percent for Gore.</i>
</p>
<p>
  Eleven days later Gore won the popular vote by more than 500,000 votes. Four years ago, shortly before the election, these major polls were wrong.
</p>
<p>
  The 2000 polls could not correctly predict the winner because they could not accurately predict the effect of the substantial "get out the vote" efforts, especially by labor unions and Democratic organizations in important swing states. Bush's supposed "solid advantage" in the popular vote did not actually exist. It was a fabrication of the polls.
</p>
<p>
  The 2000 election was essentially a tie. Out of a total of over a hundred million votes cast, the difference between Gore and Bush was one half of one percent. No poll of a few thousand potential voters can accurately predict who will win the popular vote in such a close election.
</p>
<p>
  Nor can pollsters accurately predict who will win the electoral vote, because the margin of victory in a decisive swing state might be a statistically insignificant few thousand or even a few hundred votes. In 2000, Bush won Florida by 527 votes and New Hampshire by 7,200--and Gore won Iowa by 4,100 votes, Wisconsin by 5,700, Oregon by 6,700, and New Mexico by 366 votes. The combined margin of victory in these six states was about 25,000 votes--less than three hundredths of one percent of the total presidential vote.
</p>
<p>
  Fast forward to September 18, 2004, when the <i>New York Times</i> reported that a Gallup poll found Bush leading Kerry 52 to 44 percent among registered voters, and 55 to 42 percent among likely voters. A <i>New York Times</i>/CBS News poll also had Bush over Kerry "51 percent to 42 percent among likely voters."
</p>
<p>
  Sound familiar? Since the first presidential debate, some polls have showed Kerry and Bush as even and suggested the election is too close to call. This is the only trustworthy prediction that anyone can make.
</p>
<p>
  Only in "safe" states where leads are large can polls reliably predict the winner. Yes, Kerry will win Illinois, New York and other "blue" states, and Bush will win Texas, Indiana, and other "red" states. But in this election, and especially in the crucial swing states, it is not the few undecided voters but the many new and returning lapsed voters -- the unknown voters -- who will make the difference.
</p>
<p>
  In 2004, Democrats are energized and engaged like never before. Several independent get-out-the-vote campaigns -- especially ACT (Americans Coming Together) and MoveOn.org -- have been working in the swing states to increase the Kerry vote. Some individuals are even getting out voters on their own. For example, Frank Phillips, an indefatigable 90-year-old retired businessman from New Hyde Park, New York, recently organized friends and neighbors to call voters in Florida. Now he is arranging calls to 3,000 more in Ohio.
</p>
<p>
  Syndicated columnist Mark Shields recently reported that in Ohio "one of the smartest Republican professionals I know ... confided that he feared the GOP 'needs a 5-point lead in the polls heading into Election Day' to counter what he sees as 'the Democrats' intensity' and organizational commitment."
</p>
<p>
  Because the margins are so small, unpredictable events like stormy weather on election day could also effect the outcome. Nader's campaign remains a wild card; a few thousand or even a few hundred votes that Nader takes from Kerry could tip the electoral votes of one or more swing states to Bush -- as Nader's newfound Republican backers understand.
</p>
<p>
  In this election, the only certainty is that turnout on November 2 will matter enormously.
</p>
<p>
  And even after the election, if a poll seems to have predicted the winner, remember that it had a 50 percent chance of being right. Which makes even more impressive the mistaken predictions based on the polls four years ago. Coin tosses would have done better than they did.
</p>

  <br>
  Slawek Tulaczyk studies glaciers, glacial geology, geomorphology, and soil mechanics. He is especially interested in the feedback between climatic changes and the behavior of glaciers and ice sheets, as well as the influence of changes in glacial mass on the global sea level. Tulaczyk studies the sediments and landforms left behind by retreating glaciers as clues to glacial processes. He also collaborates with researchers involved in modeling the global climate. Tulaczyk earned a B.S. physical geography from the University of Wroclaw in Poland, an M.S. in geology from Northern Illinois University, and an M.S. in civil engineering and Ph.D. in geology from the California Institute of Technology. Before joining the UCSC faculty, he was an assistant professor of geology at the University of Kentucky.<br>

        <title>Critics laud the musical risk-taking of a UCSC alumnus</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_2700" align="alignright" width="200"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/10/houghton.nagano.00-10-23.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2700" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/10/houghton.nagano.00-10-23.jpg" alt="Edward Houghton (left) and Kent Nagano" width="200" height="124" /></a>Edward Houghton (left) and Kent Nagano[/caption]
"Sprengladung!" proclaimed Berlin's <i>Der Tagespiegel</i> following the season opening performances of the German Symphony Orchestra and Chamber Chorus, conducted by UCSC alumnus Kent Nagano.
<p>
  The headline, which translates as "explosive charge," "bombshell," or "dynamite," summarized the mood of the 4,000 audience members, who applauded for a solid 15 minutes after each of the two performances.<br>
  <br>
  For his inaugural season as music director of the symphony, Nagano (who graduated in 1974) wanted to try something daring. Enlisting the help of his former teacher and colleague, UCSC dean of arts Edward Houghton, Nagano came up with a concert featuring Mahler's "Ninth Symphony" and a Renaissance mass by Johannes Ockeghem called <i>Missa Au travail suis</i> that Houghton researched and translated into modern musical notation for this performance. The <i>Der Tagespiegel</i> reviewer asked, "Ockeghem and Mahler, does this work?" And answered, "It works wonderfully!"<br>
  <br>
  Houghton says that Nagano's programming, combining works from the 20th and 15th centuries, is unprecedented. Audience members came from as far away as London, Paris, and California to attend the concert.<br>
  <br>
  "Kent gave an electrifying interpretation of the Mahler," said Houghton, who was on hand to watch his former student conduct. "It was dramatic and passionate and represents a daring expansion of musical perspectives. I, my musical colleagues, critics, and Berliners in general, all agree that Kent is transforming the German Symphony and the musical life of Berlin. I also think that his programming bombshell will echo in many other places."

Greenwood</b> and <b>Gary Griggs,</b> director of the Institute of Marine Sciences.
</p>

<p>
  New Teacher Center director <b>Ellen Moir</b> was quoted in a <i>San Jose Mercury News</i> opinion column about the shortage of teachers.
</p>

<p>

        <title>Quarterly journal honors UCSC professor of literature</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 23 Oct 2000 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>2698</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_2697" align="alignright" width="220"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/10/mackey.book.00-10-23.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2697" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/10/mackey.book.00-10-23.jpg" alt="" width="220" height="320" /></a>[/caption]
Poet and UCSC professor of literature Nathaniel Mackey is used to seeing his name in print. A prolific writer, Mackey has authored nearly a dozen books, released an audio CD, and edits the literary journal <i>Hambone.</i> But this fall, Mackey has not only contributed to a newly published work, he is the focus of it.<br>
<br>
The spring 2000 issue of the quarterly journal <i>Callaloo</i> was published in honor of Mackey. The volume of some 300 pages features Mackey's poems, poems written by others in his honor, and critical examinations of Mackey's work, notation for his musically oriented pieces, as well as numerous photos of the poet in his trademark skullcap presenting his poetry at readings around the world.<br>
<br>
According to <i>Callaloo</i> managing editor Ginger Thornton, the journal occasionally focuses an issue on a single poet or fiction writer. Mackey was suggested by guest editor Paul Naylor and approved by the journal's editorial committee (<i>Callaloo</i> is based in the English Department at the University of Virginia and published by Johns Hopkins University Press).<br>
<br>
"This is the first issue to focus on a single author since we did one on the (late) poet Sterling Brown," Thornton said. "People who contributed to this issue were very enthusiastic about the idea, and many even wrote specifically for or about Nate. That's fairly unusual. You don't usually, in the case of a living poet, have contributors who write specifically in honor of that person."<br>
<br>
Mackey's latest publication is <i>Whatsaid Serif</i> (1998). He teaches creative writing and African American, contemporary, and experimental literature at UCSC.<br>

        <title>Campus gears up for Second Harvest Holiday Food Drive</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 23 Oct 2000 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_2695" align="alignright" width="153"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/10/harvestlogo.00-10-23.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2695" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/10/harvestlogo.00-10-23.jpg" alt="" width="153" height="98" /></a>[/caption]
Last year, UCSC contributions to the Second Harvest Holiday Food Drive jumped 900 percent over 1998, but that hasn't stopped organizers of this year's drive from raising the bar still higher.
<p>
  "UCSC staff, faculty, and students contributed more than 11 tons of food, which was an overwhelming display of generosity," said Sheila K. Gottehrer, campus ombudsman and cochair of the UCSC Second Harvest Holiday Food Drive. "Our campus goal this year is 15 tons. We can do it if we get out the word."
</p>
<p>
  During the week of November 13, all faculty and staff on campus will receive a memo from Academic Senate Chair Roger Anderson and Staff Advisory Board Chair Janelle Taylor encouraging them to participate. Accompanying the memo will be an empty Second Harvest grocery bag for food donations and a preaddressed envelope for monetary contributions to the agency, she said. Campus Mail Services employees will collect bags from mail stops November 15-December 8 during their normal scheduled route.
</p>
<p>
  "There will also be a drop-off spot in the parking lot at the main entrance to campus," said Gottehrer. "We're trying to make it as easy as possible to contribute, which is why we're emphasizing this year the option of writing a check or filling a bag."
</p>
<p>
  For those who prefer to make monetary contributions, Gottehrer noted that for every dollar that is donated, Second Harvest can distribute more than $10 worth of food. Monetary contributions will be hand-delivered directly to a Second Harvest representative on December 8. (For food-drive award purposes, for every dollar donated, the food bank credits UCSC with donating three pounds worth of food.)
</p>
<p>
  The holiday food drive is part of the annual "Fill the Bus" campaign organized by the <a href="http://www.thefoodbank.org/">Second Harvest Food Bank</a> of Santa Cruz and San Benito Counties. The goal is to collect enough food to fill a bus. Second Harvest is a nonprofit organization that provides food and basic necessities to low-income seniors, people with AIDS, homeless people, single parents, abused women and children, crime and disaster victims, disabled people, and individuals and families facing crisis situations in their lives. It supports approximately 100 human service agencies and programs that serve more than 36,000 people every month. Nearly half are children.
</p>
<p>
  Last year, UCSC contributed 5,544 pounds of food and $5,769 in donations, equivalent to 17,307 pounds, for a total of 22,851 pounds, said Gottehrer. For its efforts, the campus earned Second Harvest's "Platinum Can Award," for being one of the largest contributors last year. UCSC also received the "Big Step" award for the biggest increase in donations from one year to the next. In 1998, UCSC collected 2,534 pounds.
</p>
<p>
  Students on campus are encouraged to donate money and food, and they may also participate in other activities, such as giving up a meal and donating the money to Second Harvest, said Gottherer. "Several student organizations, including sororities and fraternities, are getting really involved this year," she said.
</p>
<p>
  Gottehrer singled out for special praise the Mail Services staff who make the food drive possible, and those whose contributions helped put the following mail stops on campus at the top of last year's list of generous donors: Biology, Chemistry, Physical Plant, Humanities Division, Psychology, Registrar's Office, Staff Human Resources, Social Sciences Division, and Computer Engineering.
</p>
<p>
  "Everyone really puts their heart into this food drive, which is the product of an incredible amount of volunteer energy," said Gottehrer. "Second Harvest makes such a difference for community members, and it is wonderful to see so many people on campus participating."<br>

U.S. Commerce Secretary Norman Y. Mineta, along with Chancellor Greenwood and Congressman Sam Farr, last week dedicated a new federal marine research facility located next to Long Marine Laboratory.
<p>
  The dedication of the National Marine Fisheries Service Santa Cruz Laboratory on October 17 included a ribbon-cutting ceremony and a reception at the Seymour Center.<br>
  <br>
  The new lab will, in addition to conducting fisheries research, house the nation's first National Science Center for Marine Protected Areas.<br>
  <br>
  "Our oceans are indispensable lifelines from both environmental and economic perspectives and require first-class research to ensure their health," Mineta said. "This laboratory will provide researchers with the critical tools they need to help shape the future of our oceans."<br>
  <br>
  The state-of-the-art laboratory joins a growing community of marine research and education facilities at the Long Marine Lab site and in the Monterey Bay region. Other facilities on the site, in addition to Long Marine Lab, include a Marine Wildlife Veterinary Care and Research Center (California Department of Fish and Game) and the Seymour Marine Discovery Center. UCSC's Center for Ocean Health and a Seabird/Raptor Facility are currently under construction.<br>
  <br>
  "I am delighted to welcome our new neighbor and our newest partner in marine reseach," Greenwood said. "The new NOAA Fisheries facility, with its distinguished scientists, is a major addition to the unique consortium of leading ocean sciences organizations in the Monterey Bay Area."<br>
  <br>
  There are now 21 marine science institutions or agency programs based in the Monterey Bay region, employing nearly 1,850 scientists and support staff and with a collective annual budget of nearly $150 million. The $19.4 million fisheries laboratory replaces obsolete lab facilities in Tiburon.<br>
  <br>
  The mission of the new laboratory is to conduct research and produce scientific information and data to support conservation and management of marine fisheries and essential fish habitat. Laboratory scientists focus on a wide variety of field and laboratory studies in the Pacific Ocean off central and northern California and in coastal salmon streams. The environmental research will focus on the nearshore waters along the central California coast and San Francisco Bay and will provide a scientific basis for future management decisions.<br>
  <br>
  Commerce Secretary Mineta used the occasion of the dedication ceremony to advocate a national emphasis on ocean stewardship.<br>
  <br>
  "One of my top priorities is protecting the oceans and learning all that we can about them. With this stewardship comes important collaborations such as this one that will open doors to new partnerships to help us protect and restore our oceans for generations to come," Mineta said.<br>
  <br>
  Mineta also announced the lab's additional role as the home of the new National Science Center for Marine Protected Areas (MPAs).<br>
  <br>
  "Born out of President Clinton's Executive Order earlier this spring to enhance existing and newly established MPAs for protection and conservation for our coastal and marine resources, this center will be the focal point of our efforts," Secretary Mineta said.<br>
  <br>
  MPAs are major management tools for protecting, restoring, and enjoying coastal and marine resources in the United States and internationally. The national MPA initiative calls for the creation of a comprehensive system of marine protected areas designed to conserve and study representative habitats of all our nation's marine ecosystems.<br>
  <br>
  "There isn't a better place to locate the MPA Science Center than Santa Cruz," said Congressman Sam Farr, who has helped make the new fisheries lab a reality. "We have the best scientists; we have the most up-to-date equipment and a brand new laboratory; we have the grandest doorway to the oceans of anywhere on the planet. This is where it all happens."<br>

  A community brunch marked the 15th anniversary of the UC Santa Cruz Women's Center on Sunday, October 15. The festivities took place at the Women's Center in the historic Cardiff House on campus. The program included music by Seven Sisters, a local percussion and singing group, and a performance by the Raqs Baraka Belly Dance Troupe. Speakers included current Women's Center Director Roberta Valdez. "The UCSC Women's Center has a rich and vibrant history of political activism, intellectual stimulation, and academic and social support of students," said Valdez. "It is a refuge and a resource for women, and I am honored to carry the legacy forward." Other speakers included literature and women's studies professor Helene Moglen and Marge Frantz, both founding members of the Women's Center's Board of Directors. Frantz, a lecturer emerita in American studies and women's studies at UCSC, introduced special guest and former Women's Center Director Beatriz Lopez-Flores. Also participating was John Holloway, executive director of student development and the community services unit of UCSC Student Affairs. The UCSC Women's Center was established in 1985 by undergraduate and graduate students, faculty, staff, and community organizers who worked together to conceive and articulate programs that serve all members of its constituency. As described in its mission statement, the Women's Center, through its collaborative events and programs, works to redefine and, where possible, eliminate boundaries between the university and the city of Santa Cruz. It strives to combine academic, intellectual, social, and political matters in a way that advances and enriches the larger educational enterprise. The Women's Center is one of six student resource centers at UCSC that provide nonacademic support for students.

        <title>Five universities issue report on apparel manufacturing</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  The University of California, Harvard University, the University of Notre Dame, Ohio State University, and the University of Michigan released a report this month from a team of independent consultants that the universities commissioned to gather and analyze information on apparel manufacturing. The report is the result of a year-long effort that included the compilation and analysis of information about working conditions in the apparel industry in seven countries; the observation of working conditions in a sampling of factories in countries that represent a substantial portion of the university-licensed apparel business; and a survey of efforts being undertaken by government, business, labor, and independent organizations involved in efforts to improve working conditions. Based on meetings with stakeholders, factory visits, and surveys, the findings included:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Sub-par working conditions exist in apparel factories in all of the countries visited, as reported by stakeholders and confirmed by factory visits;<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>The diffuse nature of apparel production hinders enforcement of labor standards;<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Awareness of codes of conduct and monitoring efforts is currently insufficient to promote effective compliance;<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Many trade unions and some nongovernmental organizations are skeptical about the efficacy of monitoring;<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>The proliferation of codes of conduct and the resulting duplication of monitoring efforts does not support greater compliance;<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>It is particularly challenging to gather information from workers about the conditions in factories.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  The report also identified issues of concern, focusing on compliance with wage and hour and health and safety regulations, limitations of freedom of association and collective bargaining, employment discrimination, and related issues. The consultant team also discussed good practices that it had identified, local conditions hindering compliance with good working conditions, and opportunities for universities to contribute to the improvement of conditions.<br>
  <br>
  The report was prepared by the consultant team of the Business for Social Responsibility Education Fund (BSREF) of San Francisco; the Investor Responsibility Research Center (IRRC) of Washington, D.C., and Dara O'Rourke, an assistant professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA.<br>
  <br>
  Termed the "Independent University Initiative" because it is unaffiliated with any other inquiry, the initiative began in the summer of 1999. Its costs were underwritten by the five participating universities.<br>
  <br>
  The consultants visited factories that manufacture licensed apparel in Mexico, China/Hong Kong, El Salvador, Thailand, Pakistan, Korea, and the United States. They interviewed representatives of 24 non-governmental organizations, 15 companies or business associations, 22 public officials or international organizations, 12 trade unions, and nine researchers, academics and attorneys. Thirteen factories were also visited, and monitoring reports prepared. The consultants also reviewed other anti-sweatshop initiatives, including independent monitoring projects.<br>
  <br>
  In releasing the report for public discussion, the universities emphasized that the initiative was not conceived or carried out as a monitoring project as such. Information gathered from the monitoring of selected factories was not tied to particular factories or licensees, but rather was presented as a means of evaluating compliance issues specific to each country, and of demonstrating the role of monitoring as part of an overall compliance strategy. One of the report's conclusions is that gathering complete and reliable information about working conditions in factories making licensed apparel is a difficult process. Information on workplace conditions was gathered in factories by PricewaterhouseCoopers, which was accompanied in one-half of their visits by representatives of BSREF, IRRC and/or O'Rourke.<br>
  <br>
  Each of the universities will make its own decisions about how best to formulate and implement an "anti-sweatshop" policy for its licensed apparel.<br>

  Cultural anthropologist Susan Harding will discuss her book <a href="http://pup.princeton.edu/titles/6781.html"><i>The Book of Jerry Falwell: Fundamentalist Language and Politics</i></a> at the <a href="http://www.capitolabookcafe.com">Capitola Book Cafe</a> on Wednesday, October 18, at 7:30 p.m. In this book, Harding examines Christian fundamentalism, focusing on the Reverend Jerry Falwell and his co-pastors, and, in particular, their use of the Bible's language. She argues that this language is the medium through which born-again Christians, individual and collective, come to understand themselves as Christians. According to one reviewer, the book "challenges conventional wisdom about the Christian right and makes the world of fundamentalist believers available to the rest of us." The Capitola Book Cafe is located at 1475 41st Avenue; for more information, call (831) 462-4415.

By Mayor's Proclamation, October 10 was declared to be "UC Santa Cruz Students, Faculty, and Staff Day" in the city of Santa Cruz.
<p>
  The proclamation, given to Chancellor Greenwood at the City Council meeting that night, recognizes the "dedication and valuable contributions" UCSC's students and employees make to the community.<br>
  <br>
  The proclamation made particular note of a recent survey that determined that UCSC students, faculty, and staff performed approximately 895,000 hours of community service during summer 1998 and the 1998-99 academic year.
</p>
<p>
  According to the proclamation, that is the equivalent of work that would be done by 429 full-time employees in the community.<br>

In early October, more than 70 faculty, staff, and students gathered at a Porter College courtyard for an inaugural celebration of UCSC's new <a href="http://humwww.ucsc.edu/ihr/">Institute for Humanities Research</a> (IHR).<br>
<br>
The festive mood of the reception turned even more celebratory following surprise announcements of additional funding to the center. Humanities Dean Wlad Godzich promised to earmark $60,000 over the next three years to support a distinguished lecturer series and, in another surprise announcement, Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor John Simpson pledged $38,000 to the IHR for graduate student support.<br>
<br>
The IHR was created in 1999 to support humanities faculty and graduate student research and academic programming. The IHR is also the home of the internationally renowned Center for Cultural Studies, one of the nation's premiere centers of interdisciplinary research. IHR also supports Focused Research Activities in Feminism, Mind and Meaning, and Pre- and Early Modern Studies (PEMS).<br>
<br>
The October 4 reception featured a keynote address from Judith Butler, the Chancellor's Professor of Rhetoric and Comparative Literature at UC Berkeley, and a member of the Humanities Research Institute Board of Governors.<br>

        <title>UCSC's burgeoning South Asia arts programs get boost from new endowment</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 16 Oct 2000 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_2679" align="alignright" width="200"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/10/hasan.00-10-16.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2679" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/10/hasan.00-10-16.jpg" alt="Talat and Kamil Hasan" width="200" height="258" /></a>Talat and Kamil Hasan[/caption]
Nawab Hamid Ali Khan, ruler of the state of Rampur, India, in the early 1900s, was well known for his love and patronage of the arts. Now, halfway around the world and three generations later, the great-granddaughter of this respected Nawab and her husband are carrying on that tradition, providing funding that will substantially expand the performance and instruction of Indian classical music at UCSC.<br>
<br>
The couple are Silicon Valley entrepreneurs Talat and Kamil Hasan of Saratoga, California. Their gift of $350,000 establishes the <a href="http://arts.ucsc.edu/hasan/welcome">Kamil and Talat Hasan Endowed Chair in Classical Indian Music</a>, which provides ongoing annual support for UCSC's flourishing programs in Indian arts.<br>
<br>
"Indian classical music is a remarkable art form," said Kamil Hasan. "It stands out from popular music because it not only pleases the mind and senses, it goes much deeper. It's important to us to do our part to keep this tradition flourishing. We think UCSC is the right place to establish this endowment, both because of its proximity to Silicon Valley, which is the location of a large Indian American community, and because of the sincere commitment of Chancellor Greenwood and Dean Houghton to create a major program in classical Indian arts and South Asia studies."<br>
<br>
"We hope this endowment will do two things," said Talat Hasan. "First, that it will plant seeds for a center for Indian cultural studies, supporting not just music, but dance, drama, and the visual arts. And, secondly, that it will make these arts more widely available to future generations of students, including Indian American students. This is a wonderful tradition that traces back hundreds and hundreds of years, and it really needs to be nurtured and preserved." (<a href="hasan.bio.html">Read more</a> about Kamil and Talat Hasan)<br>
<br>
"We are honored that the Hasans chose our campus as the home for their gift," said Chancellor Greenwood. "Thanks to their generosity, UCSC can take an important step forward in its commitment to fostering the study and performance of the arts of India. We now have a total of $600,000 in endowment funding to support Indian classical music at UCSC, which lays an important cornerstone in our long-range plans to develop a thriving center for South Asia studies here."<br>
<br>
This new endowment is the Hasans' second gift to UCSC. The couple were also donors to the $250,000 Ali Akbar Khan Endowment for Classical Indian Music, established last year (other contributors were Sid and Anu Maitra, Arjun and Kiran Malhotra, and Shiv and Kiran Nadar). That endowment enriches courses in Indian classical music and has led to the presence on campus of Ali Akbar Khan, considered to be one of the world's greatest living musicians.
<p>
  Khan was named Distinguished Adjunct Professor of Music at UCSC in September 1999. Since his affiliation with the campus, Khan has taught a class in North Indian music and presented a public concert here.<br>
  <br>
  The Khan Endowment has special significance for Talat Hasan, who, as a young girl, heard stories of Khan's father, the legendary sarod master Ustad Alauddin Khan, who, along with many other famous artists, was a resident musician in her grandfather's palace for many years. The relationship created through the Khan Endowment carries on a tradition created halfway across the world more than a century ago.<br>
  <br>
  "South Asia studies at UCSC really gain momentum with the establishment of the Hasan Endowed Chair," said dean of arts and professor of music Edward Houghton. Houghton announced that, in response to the Hasans' gift, he is committing funding in the Arts Division that will support courses in the arts of India and will also lead to a full-time teaching position in Indian classical music. This position comes in addition to the activities that the new endowed chair will support. Initially, the position will be filled by distinguished visiting faculty members, and will be in place by fall 2001.<br>
  <br>
  In recent years UCSC has increased its programming in the arts of India as part of a planned curriculum expansion in South Asia studies. This academic initiative supports new curriculum, research, conferences, and distinguished visitors focusing on such diverse disciplines as history, economics, the arts, and sociology.
</p>
<p>
  Associate professor of history Dilip Basu, who chairs the South Asia Studies Initiative Committee, said, "The gift from Kamil and Talat Hasan is a splendid contribution to South Asia studies at UCSC."<br>
  <br>
  "Many Indian American entrepreneurs are endowing chairs and supporting other educational endeavors in this area," Talat Hasan said. But, she noted, "Most of us have been fortunate to make our money in technical fields, so we tend to support technical endeavors much more. Kamil and I felt that there weren't going to be many people whose first thought was supporting the arts, so we thought we should try to take a lead in that area. We hope this endowment will inspire others to think about this cultural heritage and to expand it to other disciplines and other cultures of India, to preserve this very beautiful and ancient heritage."<br>

        <title>UC to study labor and employment issues</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  UC Office of the President
</p>

<p>
  The University of California is launching a new multicampus research initiative aimed at studying and finding solutions for problems of employment in California and the nation.<br>
  <br>
  The tentatively titled UC Institute for Labor and Employment will build on the existing Institutes of Industrial Relations at UC Berkeley and UCLA, but will draw on faculty, staff, and student resources throughout the UC system in supporting a variety of employment-related research activities.
</p>

<p>
  The new initiative was funded by a $6 million appropriation in the current state budget.<br>
  <br>
  "The institute will not only help develop California's highly skilled workforce," said UC President Richard C. Atkinson. "It will benefit all Californians by exploring ways in which more of our citizens, including the economically disadvantaged, can participate in the state's burgeoning economy."<br>
  <br>
  Key activities of the new institute will include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>An annual or biannual study of the state of the California workforce.<br>
    <br>
    The focus of the study may vary: a statewide sample survey of employee households; a needs assessment study of the employment policy concerns of decision-makers and stakeholders throughout the state; a survey of the employment practices of California firms; evaluation studies of the effectiveness of existing regulations and policies affecting California workers and employers.<br>
    <br>
    The research will provide the basis for a widely accessible report to the state that interprets the results and offers policy recommendations. Although no existing California agency or firm now provides the kind of data or policy reports that are envisioned for the institute, it will partner with such organizations as the state's Economic Development Department in collecting and analyzing rich data on wage and employment trends.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>In addition, the institute will fund a variety of projects by UC faculty and staff on labor trends and problems. The research will be competitively funded and peer-reviewed, but it will also be strongly problem- and policy-oriented, as opposed to "pure" or theory-driven research.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>The institute will sponsor conferences and seminars on employment trends and problems and the policy issues they raise.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>The institute will maintain a high-quality library and web-based information system to make its data and reports easily accessible to the research community, policymakers, and the public.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Although the central mission of the institute is research, it will work with UC faculty and instructional departments in developing UC's on- and off-campus offerings in labor and employment studies.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Finally, the institute will partner with local government agencies, unions, businesses, and community-based organizations in designing and promoting economic development and job training programs.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  <br>
  Said Art Pulaski, executive secretary-treasurer of the California Federation of Labor: "Our economic boom has produced tremendous prosperity for some, but it has left many working people behind. We are in danger of becoming two Californias: the dot-commers and professionals who are riding the wave of the new economy and the rest of us--the teachers, the construction workers, the farm laborers, the garment workers, the retail clerks, the childcare and nursing home staff. Many of these people are immigrants and minorities who are having great difficulty making ends meet.<br>
  <br>
  "The University of California should study these jobs and the problems of these workers and offer well-informed advice to policymakers in labor, business, and government. The result will be new policies, partnerships, and employment institutions that contribute to an economy in which prosperity is shared and opportunities are opened to all."<br>
  <br>
  Among the legislators instrumental in getting the institute funded in the state budget were: Assembly Speaker Robert M. Hertzberg, Senate Majority Leader John Burton, and Assemblymembers Gil Cedillo, Antonio R. Villaraigosa, Dion Aroner, and Carole Migden.<br>
  <br>
  Hertzberg, who led the effort to include the institute in the Assembly's budget bill, said: "This multicampus initiative by the University of California to study issues affecting working families is a timely and exciting undertaking. I am very pleased that we in the legislature were able to earmark $6 million in new UC funding for this program and that the governor approved the entire amount."<br>

  Gaurang Yodh, a professor of physics at the UC Irvine, is both an expert in high-energy physics and a highly accomplished sitar player. When Yodh visits UCSC this week, he will perform a public concert of sitar music in addition to delivering a talk at the Physics Department's weekly colloquium. The concert will take place at the Porter College Provost's House at 8 p.m. on Thursday, October 12. Yodh will be accompanied on tabla by Anup Patel. The event is free and open to the general public. From the age of nine, Yodh studied sitar for ten years as a Shagrit of Ustad Mohammed Khan Beenkar. Being a Shagrit involves total immersion in music study with the maestro. Yodh has performed extensively in the United States, starting with programs at the University of Chicago (1948-54) and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art (1955).
</p>

<p>
  His recordings include two releases on the Westminster label (1956) that were among the first recorded presentations of Indian music in the United States. In addition, he composed the background music for the award-winning documentary <i>Future of Ram</i> by Phillips Foster.<br>
  <br>
  Before joining the faculty at UC Irvine, Yodh was a professor of high-energy physics at the University of Maryland, where he was also an instructor of the sitar in the Music Department. His sitar concerts and a course he offered in Indian classical music performance on the sitar helped launch the University of Maryland's ethnomusicology program.<br>
  <br>
  Tabla player Anup Patel is a longtime student of Pandit Nayan Ghosh of Bombay. He is also the owner of Quik Print in Santa Cruz.<br>
  <br>
  In addition to the concert, Yodh will be giving a talk at the UCSC Physics Colloquium at 4 p.m. in Thimann 1 Lecture Hall on Thursday, October 12, on "High-energy Physics at Chicago--The Fermi Years."
</p>

<p>
  Yodh was a graduate student at the University of Chicago during the period after World War II when the field of high-energy physics was in its infancy. Chicago physicists led by Enrico Fermi made many exciting discoveries during this exceptionally glorious time in the history of physics.<br>

        <title>UCSC raises $53.4 million in contracts and grants funding to support research and education</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 09 Oct 2000 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>

        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  Researchers attracted $53.4 million in external contracts and grants to UCSC last year, the highest total ever received by the campus.
</p>

<p>
  The increase in contracts and grants funding during the 1999-2000 year reflects a pattern of continued growth that the campus has sustained for the last decade. The campus's total contracts and grants funding has grown by more than 150 percent since 1990.
</p>

<p>
  The single-largest grant, for $4.3 million, was received by the Center for Adaptive Optics, one of five Science and Technology Centers approved for funding by the National Science Foundation in 1999.
</p>

<p>
  Research funds received from federal, state, and private agencies totaled $53,405,919 between July 1, 1999, and June 30, 2000. That figure is 5.6 percent higher than the previous year's total of $50.6 million.
</p>

<p>
  "We continue to do well, and UCSC's grant and contracts awards have grown over the last five years at the fastest rate of any UC campus," said William Clark, director of UCSC's Office of Sponsored Projects.
</p>

<p>
  The campus processed a total of 628 awards in 1999-2000, compared to 635 in 1998-99. Principal funders included the National Science Foundation ($13.9 million), the National Institutes of Health ($7.6 million), the U.S. Department of Education ($5.6 million), the U.S. Department of Energy ($2.9 million), and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ($2.3 million).
</p>

<p>
  Eight different departments or research groups at UCSC brought in more than $2 million each in contracts and grants funding. They are biology ($6.3 million), Institute of Marine Sciences ($5.7 million), education ($5.4 million), chemistry ($5.4 million), MBEST ($3.3 million), Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics ($2.8 million), computer engineering ($2.0 million), and Institute of Tectonics ($2.0 million).
</p>

<p>
  The largest awards were received for research in the areas of adaptive optics, cultural diversity and second-language learning, cancer research, development of the Fort Ord/MBEST project, particle physics, and computer networking.<br>

        <title>Today's challenge for educators: Attracting minority teachers</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 09 Oct 2000 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>2661</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  The greatest challenge facing educators today is attracting students from a wide range of backgrounds into the teaching profession, said June A. Gordon, author of the new book <i>The Color of Teaching,</i> who gave the keynote address last Friday at the Illinois regional conference of the Association of Teacher Educators.
</p>

<p>
  Student diversity must be met by a diverse teaching force if U.S. schools are to address the needs of all children, said Gordon, adding that all teachers must be prepared to work with the diversity in today's classrooms.
</p>

<p>
  "The number one reason people of color don't go into teaching is family discouragement," said Gordon. Other reasons vary depending on the ethnic group, said Gordon, whose research includes interviews with more than 200 teachers of color across the country, including African Americans, Native Americans, Asian Americans, and Latinos.
</p>

<p>
  Recurring themes include the image and lack of respect afforded teaching, as well as community influences. In addition, many students of color have had negative experiences in elementary and secondary school, she added. "Racism and the mislabeling of children have a profound and lasting effect on children," said Gordon.
</p>

<p>
  "The image of teaching still remains something that middle-class white women do because they like having summers off, but that is so different from the reality," said Gordon, whose research goal is to build a greater understanding of why students of color do not choose to become teachers. "Understanding the complexity of teaching and portraying the reality of the profession would help correct misperceptions."
</p>

<p>
  Contrary to public perception, teaching is a creative, challenging, and rewarding profession that requires risk-taking and commitment, said Gordon. Starting salaries of $39,000 in the Santa Cruz area rival beginning salaries at universities for assistant professors with doctoral degrees, she said.
</p>

<p>
  Recruiting people of color will require systemic changes, including:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Improved K-12 education. "A lot of kids don't have the option of going into teaching because their own educations are inadequate," she said.
  </li>
  <li>Increased options for teachers of color. "You can't assume that a Latino teacher will want to work in a Latino community," said Gordon, adding that such "tracking" of teachers is common.
  </li>
  <li>Greater awareness of the importance of teaching.
  </li>
  <li>K-12 teachers need to encourage their students to go into teaching. "Most teachers go into teaching because they want to transform the lives of children," said Gordon. "That profound experience, which takes place every day in the classroom, needs to be kept at the forefront."
  </li>
  <li>Involve parents. "Parents don't necessarily feel a part of school culture, especially working class parents," said Gordon. "The more they understand what is happening at school, the more respect they will have for teachers."
  </li>
  <li>Greater awareness of the path of education. "Parents need to understand the system of college-preparatory classes, which is particularly foreign to adults who did not attend college themselves," said Gordon. "They need to know that basically, you have to take math and science in the eighth grade, or your options are diminished."
  </li>
  <li>Provide early experiences working with kids. High school and college students can assist in elementary or middle-school classrooms, creating a natural bridge to becoming a teacher.
  </li>
  <li>Recruit prospective teachers from the community.
  </li>
  <li>Enhance financial aid options for aspiring teachers.
  </li>
</ul>

Twenty-five undergraduates presented the results of their summer research projects at the Fourth Annual CAMP Undergraduate Research Symposium on Friday, September 29. The students presented their research on posters in the lobby of the Earth and Marine Sciences Building, and the event also featured oral presentations by two students.<br>
<br>
From monitoring sea lion populations to analyzing thermoelectric effects in semiconductors, the undergraduate researchers pursued a wide range of investigations under the guidance of faculty mentors.<br>
<br>
Most of the students are participants in the California Alliance for Minority Participation (CAMP) in Science, Engineering, and Mathematics. CAMP is a statewide program that supports and encourages undergraduates from underrepresented minorities to complete the B.S. degree. By integrating research and undergraduate education, CAMP creates a cohesive set of experiences that prepare undergraduates for graduate education and influence their career choices.<br>
<br>
The symposium also included students involved in the ACCESS program, a partnership between UCSC and four community colleges to increase transfer rates of underrepresented students, and the Minority Access to Research Careers (MARC) program, designed to give targeted minority students an opportunity to gain experience in laboratory research.<br>
<br>
"The undergraduate research experience at UCSC provides students the rare opportunity to engage in supervised research and learn in a dynamic environment of discovery from professors who are leaders in their fields," said dean of natural sciences David Kliger.<br>
<br>
Russell Flegal, professor of environmental toxicology and the CAMP regional director, noted the sophistication of the student research projects and the skills required to carry them out.<br>
<br>
"We are extremely proud of the student achievements that are on display at this symposium," Flegal said.<br>
<br>
In addition to the CAMP symposium, the Division of Natural Sciences also sponsors an annual poster symposium every spring that features a wide range of undergraduate research in the natural sciences and engineering.<br>

        <title>Arboretum and California Native Plant Society to hold fall plant sale</title>

Impressed by the flowers in those Olympic bouquets? Grow them yourself from Australian plants in the UCSC Arboretum's extensive collection.<br>
<br>
The Arboretum is holding its annual Fall Plant Sale in conjunction with the California Native Plant Society on Saturday, October 14, from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. The sale will take place at the Arboretum Eucalyptus Grove, near the intersection of Western Drive and High Street.<br>
<br>
With the largest collection of Australian plants outside of Australia, the UCSC Arboretum offers many shrubs that bear unusual flowers unique to Australia. Some of these impressive flowers can be seen in the bouquets carried by Olympic medalists at the Sydney Games. One example is <i>Telopea speciosissima,</i> with crimson flowers six inches wide. These spectacular plants are best grown in east-facing or northeast-facing areas or in areas with enough shade to keep the roots moderately cool.<br>
<br>
New this year from the Australian collection is <i>Brachysema minor,</i> a flat-growing ground cover with beautiful oval, bluish-green leaves. Its small pea flowers with pale-orange banners and coral-red keels are somewhat hidden by the foliage.<br>
<br>
The sale will also feature some new South African plants, including <i>Protea eximia</i> "Fiery Duchess." This plant is a tall shrub with long-stemmed, deep-red flowers and silvery, bluish-green leaves that wrap the stem. It is fairly hardy, having survived the 1998 winter freeze at the Arboretum, and requires acid soil with good drainage.<br>
<br>
Another offering from the South African collection is a <i>Leucadendron</i> hybrid called "Rising Sun." It is similar to <i>Leucadendron</i> "Safari Sunset" (both are crosses between <i>L. laureolum</i> and <i>L. salignum</i>). "Rising Sun" is also fairly cold-hardy and has deep pink-red flower heads that grow on stems up to a foot and a half long.<br>
<br>
A Mexican tree dahlia, <i>Dahlia imperialis</i>, will also be available. Sporting deep orange flowers with bright yellow centers, it is a wonderful plant for fall color. A wide range of other plants will also be on sale.<br>
<br>
The UCSC Arboretum is joining with the California Native Plant Society (CNPS) for the fifth year to offer a wide selection of plants at this annual sale. From 10 to 11 a.m., the sale will be open only to members of the UCSC Arboretum and CNPS. You may join the Arboretum Associates on the day of the sale.<br>
<br>
For gardeners on the Central Coast, fall is an ideal time to plant California native plants or South African and Australian landscaping plants. The cooler months after the last heat wave of summer passes allow plants to establish good root systems before the next dry summer season. By establishing drought-tolerant plants from California, Australia, and South Africa now, gardeners can have plants that look good for years to come.<br>
<br>
The Arboretum specializes in plants not readily available in nurseries. Several of <i>Sunset</i> magazine's "best of the new plants" have been selections that were created or imported by the Arboretum staff. The Fall Plant Sale is an opportunity to buy plants now that may show up later on such lists. Local nurseries often donate additional plants to the sale.<br>
<br>
The UCSC Arboretum is open daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. The Arboretum gift shop, Norrie's Gifts, is open Tuesdays through Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., and Sundays, 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. The Jean and Bill Lane Horticultural Library is open Wednesdays through Sundays, 1 p.m. to 4 p.m.<br>

        <title>Social sciences honors two for teaching</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 09 Oct 2000 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>2654</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  Two longtime professors were honored by the Division of Social Sciences last week for their excellence in teaching. Dane Archer, professor of sociology, and Isebill "Ronnie" V. Gruhn, professor of politics, received the Division of Social Sciences' 1999-2000 Distinguished Teaching Awards at an annual division convocation hosted by Dean Martin Chemers. The awards, which recognize outstanding undergraduate teaching in the social sciences, carry with them a $500 cash prize and an engraved plaque that features a "golden apple." Archer, an expert in verbal and nonverbal communication, joined the UCSC faculty in 1972. His other areas of expertise include violence, war, and peace; social psychology; cross-national research; crime and law.
</p>

<p>
  Gruhn joined UCSC in 1969. An expert in international politics, Gruhn focuses on African politics, as well as international and transnational institutions. She is also interested in relations between rich and poor states.<br>
  <br>
  "Dane Archer and Ronnie Gruhn represent so much of what is wonderful about UCSC's faculty," said Chemers. "They are both highly accomplished scholars who bring an interdisciplinary approach to their research, and they excel in the classroom, where they have inspired their students as well as their colleagues. It is my great pleasure to honor their contributions to the campus."<br>
  <br>
  Archer and Gruhn were selected by Chemers from a list of recommendations compiled by a faculty committee based on nominations put forth by department chairs. The committee was chaired by Daniel Press, Pepper-Giberson Associate Professor of Environmental Studies. The annual awards were established in 1991.<br>
  <br>
  Social sciences is one of five academic divisions at UCSC; the others are arts, engineering, humanities, and natural sciences. Each division is home to a wide range of departments and programs.
</p>

<p>
  Social sciences includes anthropology, community studies, economics, education, environmental studies, Latin American and Latino studies, legal studies, politics, psychology, and sociology.<br>

        <title>UC Davis scholar named founding director of systemwide language consortium</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 02 Oct 2000 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>2652</wp:post_id>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  Robert J. Blake, a professor of Spanish and classics at UC Davis and an internationally renowned scholar in second language acquisition, has been appointed the founding director of the newly-established UC Consortium for Language Learning and Teaching.<br>
  <br>
  "Professor Blake has an impressive teaching and research record as well as extensive administrative experience," said UC President Richard C. Atkinson. "He is well versed in the use of technology to enhance language learning, and I am confident he will do an outstanding job of handling the challenges and opportunities the consortium offers."<br>
  <br>
  According to organizers, the impetus for the creation of the systemwide Consortium for Language Learning and Teaching was the need to make the most effective use of UC's vast language teaching resources at a time when there is a dramatic increase in enrollments in foreign language courses and the demand for new areas of language instruction. Currently, the University of California offers its students the opportunity to study 78 languages.<br>
  <br>
  The hope is that by fostering communication and collaboration among and across the language programs at the UC campuses through the new consortium, these resources can be more widely available to students and faculty.<br>
  <br>
  "This initiative comes at a time when our students increasingly need an expanded knowledge of the world's diverse languages and cultures. A UC student can no longer afford to be monolingual in today's internationalized economy," Blake said. "I am extremely pleased to help coordinate the enormous strengths of the language faculty across the UC campuses in a way that will make our system a national model for language delivery.<br>
  <br>
  "This will require seeking a balance between the heavily enrolled languages such as Spanish and the other less commonly taught languages. The consortium seeks to provide our students with an increased access to language study through a combination of the best classroom practices, distance learning, and EAP programs. The consortium will promote language study as a vital need for every UC student."<br>
  <br>
  Julius Zelmanowitz, vice provost for academic initiatives for the UC system, said, "What is particularly notable is that the consortium results from a grass roots effort by faculty across the UC system, supported by the academic leadership of the campuses. The system as a whole owes a debt of gratitude to some forward-thinking faculty who saw the potential for using the power of the system to great benefit."<br>
  <br>
  Blake received his doctorate in Hispanic linguistics from the University of Texas in Austin in 1980. He began his academic career at Dartmouth College where he spent five years, followed by seven years at the University of Rochester where he held the Mercer Brugler Chair for Innovations in Teaching.<br>
  <br>
  In 1992, UC Davis recruited Blake, who served most recently as department chair and director of the campus's Second Language Acquisition Institute.<br>
  <br>
  The systemwide Consortium on Language Learning and Teaching will be housed on the Davis campus.<br>

  <img align="right" border="0" height="224" src="../art/dizikes.book.150.jpg" width="150" alt=""><b>John Dizikes,</b> professor emeritus of American studies, is the author of <i>Yankee Doodle Dandy: The Life and Times of Tod Sloan</i> (October 2000, Yale University Press). Dizikes's book profiles the jockey who changed horse racing by riding in a crouch--the first competitive rider to do so. Dizikes, whose book on opera won the prestigious National Book Critics Circle Award, tells the story of this world's most famous turn-of-the-century jockey. An early review states, "A true gem of a book--a page-turner that is nonetheless full of understated wisdom."
</p>

<p>
  <b>Judit Moschkovich,</b> an assistant professor of education at UCSC, has contributed chapters to two new books. The first book, from the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, addresses issues of diversity in teaching mathematics. Moschkovich's chapter is entitled "Learning Mathematics in Two Languages: Moving from Obstacles to Resources," which appears in <i>Changing Faces of Mathematics (Vol. 1): Perspectives on Multiculturalism and Gender Equity</i> (Reston, VA: National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, 2000).
</p>

<p>
  Moschkovich also coauthored a chapter with Mary Brenner, an associate professor of education at UC Santa Barbara, for a collection of writings by math and science education researchers describing the methodologies they use to conduct research. Their chapter, entitled "Integrating a Naturalistic Paradigm into Research on Mathematics and Science Cognition and Learning," appears in the new book <i>Handbook of Research Design in Mathematics and Science Education</i> (Mahwah, N.J.: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 2000).<br>

<p>
  Construction began in September on the first new facilities to be built at the former Fort Ord military reservation: a headquarters building complex for the UC Monterey Bay Education, Science, and Technology (MBEST) Center.
</p>
<p>
  The 26,000-square-foot headquarters complex, scheduled for completion in spring 2001, will house a variety of tenants, including the MBEST Center administrative offices, UCSC Extension, the city of Marina Small Business Incubator, and other tenants.<br>
  <br>
  "We are very excited about the new building, and we are especially pleased to be housing the Small Business Incubator. This joint undertaking represents an important and growing partnership between UC Santa Cruz and the city of Marina," said Lora Lee Martin, director of the MBEST Center.<br>
  <br>
  UCSC is developing the MBEST Center as a cornerstone of the Fort Ord redevelopment plan. The center aims to foster regional economic development and job creation by establishing a community of high-technology businesses.<br>
  <br>
  The Marina Small Business Incubator plans to offer a variety of support programs for participating businesses, such as access to technical support services, regional research linkages, educational and networking programs, financing assistance, and technology transfer and licensing advice. As an element of the city's overall economic development strategy, graduates from the incubator will be encouraged to relocate to adjacent business parks, thus catalyzing the creation of over 500 new jobs over the next ten years, said Marina mayor Jim Perrine.<br>
  <br>
  "The Small Business Incubator is an innovative project combining city of Marina resources with the technical expertise of the local private and public academic community," Perrine said. "These combined resources will provide strong support for start-up and expanding business enterprises."<br>
  <br>
  UCSC Extension will use the new MBEST facilities to expand its continuing education programs. UCSC Extension has been an active part of the Fort Ord reuse effort from the beginning, offering a variety of courses and programs at the MBEST Center.
</p>
<p>
  The extension facilities in the new MBEST building complex will include a state-of-the-art computer lab and several new classrooms. Extension is planning new and expanded programs in several areas, including computer and information technology, business administration, and teacher training.<br>
  <br>
  "We are also planning several new programs that specifically address the needs of the Monterey Bay region in areas such as hospitality management," said Dale Stansbury, assistant dean for economic development at UCSC Extension.<br>
  <br>
  Space will also be available for lease to new tenants. The building complex is designed to accommodate a variety of tenants, including light industrial, research and development, and office uses. Martin said she expects the new building and the synergies between the various tenants to catalyze further enterprise development in the region by creating a nucleus of activities and support services.<br>
  <br>
  "One of our goals is to help draw new technologies into the business incubator by working with regional institutions to identify potential business opportunities," Martin said. "The Monterey Bay Crescent is home to a remarkable concentration of educational and research institutions that provide a solid foundation for sustainable economic development."<br>
  <br>
  Martin said she expects the business incubator to attract companies in the fields of information science and technology; telecommunications; environmental and marine sciences, technologies, and instrumentation; agricultural research and technology; and other emerging technologies.<br>
  <br>
  Construction of the new facilities is funded by grants from the federal Economic Development Administration and the Community Development Block Grant program. Other grants to the UC MBEST Center, in partnership with the city of Marina and the Fort Ord Reuse Authority, have funded over $6 million in new infrastructure, including a roadway, utilities, and other services to a roughly 55-acre site designated for the first phase of MBEST development.
</p>
<p>
  Further development of the site is planned after completion of the headquarters building.<br>
  <br>
  The building was designed by David Baker and Associates Architects of San Francisco and is being constructed by Salinas-based Tombleson Inc.<br>

        <title>Kerr Hall faculty and staff computer training labs upgraded</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 02 Oct 2000 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>2642</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  This past summer, Human Resources assumed sole responsibility for administering the Kerr Hall computer training labs, a duty previously shared with CATS. As part of the reorganization, permanent funding has been earmarked to support a significant part of lab operations, and hardware and software upgrades are being implemented. The Kerr Hall Mac Lab and Kerr Hall PC Lab were created five years ago mainly to provide staff with training in new administrative software, especially the Payroll Personnel System (PPS) and the Financial Information System (FIS). During the past five years, demand has also grown significantly for training in standard software programs (such as Microsoft Word and FileMaker Pro) and web-oriented applications (such as DreamWeaver).
</p>

<p>
  According to Sharon Cohen Barry, manager of SHR's Training and Development unit, demand in the two areas--administrative systems and standard computer programs--has increased rapidly, making the need for regularly upgraded lab equipment essential.<br>
  <br>
  Computer training directly related to UC or campus operations is considered mandatory. Mandatory training includes FIS, PPS, SIS, Data Warehouse, and the Vista/Budget System. There will be no fee for lab use for mandatory training. All other computer training is considered nonmandatory.
</p>

<p>
  For 2000-01, there will be no fee for lab use hours on nonmandatory programs, Cohen Barry says. Those costs will be covered this year through Human Resources funds and then evaluated to determine whether hourly lab-use fees for nonmandatory training are needed in 2001-02. If it is determined that fees are necessary, HR will give notice with ample time for units to plan for any future lab costs.<br>
  <br>
  Hardware and software upgrades, which generally need to occur every four years, were completed in the Mac Lab in September and will be completed in the PC Lab in mid-October. Current configuration information is on the Training & Development <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/train-dev">web site</a>. A plan to ensure future lab upgrades has also been developed.<br>
  <br>
  Training & Development will continue as operational manager of the labs, including scheduling and monitoring computer support.
</p>

<p>
  To schedule use of the labs, send an e-mail to <a href="mailto:techtraining@cats.ucsc.edu">techtraining@cats.ucsc.edu</a> or contact Bonita Sebastian (<a href="mailto:bonitas@cats.ucsc.edu">bonitas@cats.ucsc.edu</a>).<br>

        <title>Environmental Toxicology Department hosts inaugural lecture on 'Frontiers in Toxicology'</title>

        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  "Frontiers in Toxicology," an inaugural lecture to celebrate the establishment of the Department of Environmental Toxicology, will feature presentations by two distinguished scientists on Thursday, October 5, from 3 to 5 p.m. The event will take place at the Theater Arts Second Stage and is free and open to the public. Daniel Koshland Jr., professor of biochemistry and molecular biology at UC Berkeley, will speak on "Stereoselectivity in Enzymology and Toxicology." Ellen Silbergeld, professor of epidemiology, pathology, and toxicology at the University of Maryland Medical School, will speak on "Mercury Poisoning and Malaria: New Connections Between Ancient Diseases." Koshland has made innumerable contributions to science and has received many awards, including the National Medal of Science. His induced fit theory is one of the most important conceptual advances in biochemistry and has led to new understandings of enzyme action and the control and regulation of biological systems. He continues his work on the mechanisms by which cells receive and respond to external cues and has shown that bacteria have a rudimentary memory that affects their responses to their environment. Koshland has served on the councils of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, as president of the American Society of Biological Chemists, and as editor of the journal <i>Science.</i> Silbergeld is a recognized leader in the interdisciplinary fields of molecular epidemiology and mechanistic toxicology. Her specific research interests include toxicology and epidemiology of lead, mercury, and dioxin, with an emphasis on effects of these agents on the immune system, nervous system, and reproduction and development. Silbergeld has received several awards for her scientific and public policy work, including a MacArthur "genius" Fellowship in 1993. She has served on many national and international scientific and expert panels, including those for state and federal governments, the World Health Organization, and the World Bank, and as chief of the Neurotoxicology Section at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.

<p>
  In mid-October, Santa Cruz will be visited by a company of dancers considered to be among the best of their generation. The company, Ailey II, is made up of recent graduates of one of the many training programs of the Ailey School. Both the school and Ailey II run under the auspices of the <a href="http://www.alvinailey.org">Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater</a>--one of the country's most respected and long-standing modern dance companies.<br>
  <br>
</p><a href="http://events.ucsc.edu/artslecs/">Arts & Lectures</a> will present Ailey II in the Mainstage Theater on October 14 and 15 at 8 p.m.<br>
<br>
<b>Q:</b> How do you choose the company members for Ailey II?<br>
<br>
<b>A:</b> Dancers are selected from those who have completed any of the Ailey School's advanced programs. At that point, they don't audition, they are selected from the pool of graduating dancers. The criteria are the dancer's technical ability and ability to adapt to different musical styles. But I am also looking for something else. I don't know exactly how to describe it--it has to do with a willingness to reveal oneself. Alvin also used to describe it as a style of "dancing from the inside out." The uniqueness of the individual, and how they convey it, is very important.<br>
<p>
  Alvin was always looking for a very well-versed dancer, for someone who was proficient in a number of styles--classical ballet, modern, jazz, street dance. The way I look at it, I want a dancer who has a ballet bottom and a modern top. The use of the torso is very important, and is rooted in a jazz sensibility, but the use of feet and legs in a ballet style is also very important. When you get the right combination, you get this amalgam of classical lines fused with modern dance that is delicious.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Q:</b> How would you describe the dancers who perform with Ailey II?<br>
  <br>
  <b>A:</b> These are exceptional dancers, but they are still growing tremendously. There is still an enormous amount of nurturing and coaching going on at this point, because our repertory is a very challenging one. And there is a tremendous demand on the dancers' abilities to project themselves and communicate the material. It's an exciting environment to work in; to me, this has a feel of the early days of Ailey. You see these fantastic dancers pushing the limits, working in a variety of repertory. You see this energy and these incredible bodies and, you know, it's just delightful to see all of this.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Q:</b> One critic said of your company: "Call it the 'second' company, but don't call it second-rate."<br>
  <br>
  <b>A:</b> That quote refers to the quality of what we do. Granted our dancers are young, perhaps on the threshold of their careers; but that comment is acknowledging that they do an exceptional job of performing a challenging repertory. Really, they're in their own category and not to be compared with more seasoned dancers. We're not trying to be the Ailey first company. Ailey II dancers stay with us for a couple of years in preparation for going there [to the Alvin Ailey company] or somewhere else professional.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Q:</b> What is important to you about dance? What should dance do for an audience?<br>
  <br>
  <b>A:</b> As a philosophy, one wants to bring to audiences the best of modern dance in all of its accessibility. Dance is not a secret, it shouldn't be a secret. And it's not esoteric. At its best, I think dance can open one's vision and sensitivity. It can be a very vital experience, and you and the audience, how you connect with that ballet or dance--how it touches you and how you respond to it--can be very real, with all the joy and drama very accessible.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Q:</b> You will be doing a master class for UCSC dance students while you're here. You've done that in the past as well. What has that experience been like?<br>
  <br>
  <b>A:</b> These classes are always very exciting--and overcrowded! The students in past times have been very responsive. I think the [Ailey II] teachers are bringing something that is a challenge for them, and something that may be very new and therefore exciting. It may be a new technique or just a new way of thinking about something they're already working on. Our teachers adapt to the skill level of the class, but we like to keep it challenging.<br>

Koshland has made innumerable contributions to science and has received many awards, including the National Medal of Science. His induced fit theory is one of the most important conceptual advances in biochemistry and has led to new understandings of enzyme action and the control and regulation of biological systems. He continues his work on the mechanisms by which cells receive and respond to external cues and has shown that bacteria have a rudimentary memory that affects their responses to their environment.<br>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  UC Office of the President UC President Richard C. Atkinson issued the following statement last week regarding a proposed plan for increasing educational opportunities at the University of California: "Over the next decade, there will be a tremendous increase in the number of students preparing to enter California higher education. UC is anticipating more than 60,000 new students by 2010. This level of growth requires all sectors of higher education to aggressively rethink how it serves the state. "As the college-age population grows, I believe that the state and UC must be committed to maintaining the viability of the California Master Plan for Higher Education, which promises a high-quality, affordable college education to all California high school graduates who seek one. "Having a college-educated population is essential to our state. Students who succeed at UC and other four-year institutions fuel our information-based economy. As higher education institutions, we must continue to equip our young people with the skills necessary to become leaders and engaged participants in a knowledge-based society. "The University of California has always sought creative and innovative ways to increase educational opportunities for the next generation of Californians. I believe that more must be done to recognize and reward high-achieving students from all areas and backgrounds across the state. "To meet this challenge of increasing demand for a college education and continue to support the state's long-term needs, I am asking the Academic Senate to consider a major change in UC's approach to eligibility and admission. "I am proposing a new path for students to enter UC, in addition to graduating in the top 12.5 percent statewide or the top 4 percent of their high school. This path would grant admission to an additional 8.5 percent of top students from each high school provided they satisfactorily complete a transfer program at a community college. "This proposed effort will in effect constitute a dual admission program that strengthens our relations with the California Community Colleges and extends the long-term viability of the Master Plan for Higher Education. Most importantly, it will send a clear signal to students all over the state, from urban and rural schools, from all ethnic groups and all socioeconomic groups, that they have a clear path to a UC degree. "This proposal will require thorough consideration and approval by our faculty. Implementation will present many challenges in outreach, admissions management and coordination of student services. However, the potential benefits justify grasping this chance to increase educational opportunities for more of the state's students."

  Transportation and Parking Services With construction on and off campus creating traffic congestion and the Core West Parking Structure still four months from completion, Transportation and Parking Services (TAPS) is stepping up its efforts to mitigate these impacts with new and expanded programs. "Not only is TAPS focusing on the short-term parking and transportation needs of the campus," said Wes Scott, TAPS director, "but we're developing innovative commute-alternative programs that are vital for the future of the campus and the community." In response to the anticipated parking crunch this fall, TAPS and the Santa Cruz Seaside Company are providing a free park-and-ride lot near the Boardwalk for UCSC faculty, staff, and students. Two hundred parking spaces will be available weekdays between 7 a.m. and 10:30 p.m. To get people between the lot and campus, TAPS is providing free shuttle service during the morning and afternoon commute hours. Those using the lot must display a parking permit that can be obtained at no cost through the TAPS Sales Office. To replace parking spaces lost to construction in the Science Hill area, the North Remote parking lot has been designated for "A" and "B" parking only, and attendant-assisted parking in the lot will add 25 spaces to the 70-space lot. People who don't want to make the short walk between the lot and Science Hill may ride a TAPS shuttle, which is providing service at 20-minute intervals between 7:30 a.m. and 6 p.m. weekdays. After 6 p.m., the Express Night Core will drop off passengers at the lot on request. "TAPS programs will be in full swing this fall," said Scott. "We're expanding some of our most popular ones." TAPS newest program, the Bike Trailer, has proven so popular that a second trailer has been added to the weekday service. In mid-September, the Bike Trailer began operating at 15-minute intervals between 6:45 and 10 a.m. Cyclists can catch a ride with their bicycle from the Marcelo's Restaurant parking lot at Mission and Bay. Then, passengers can unload bikes at the Physical Plant Metro stop, at Cowell Circle, and at the Baskin Engineering loading dock. Fourteen bikes can be carried on each run. In October, TAPS will begin operating two new commuter vanpools. These new vans, supported by a grant from the Monterey Bay Unified Air Pollution Control District, are the campus's first compressed natural gas vehicles. The commuter vanpools will serve the Aptos/Soquel and the Live Oak/Eastside Santa Cruz areas. These vanpools will cost $17.50 per month, one-third the monthly rate of an "A" parking permit. In addition to the new TAPS offerings, UCSC continues to offer bus service. During the academic year, Santa Cruz Metro operates numerous direct and express transit services to UCSC. The areas served include West and East Santa Cruz, Watsonville, and the San Lorenzo Valley. These transit services--and all other Metro routes in Santa Cruz County--are free to UCSC faculty, staff, and students. Free bus passes are available through the TAPS Sales Office. In addition, October 2-6 is California Rideshare Week. Now in its 18th year, this statewide promotion encourages commuters to improve traffic congestion, reduce air pollution, and decrease parking demand by carpooling, bicycling, vanpooling, riding the bus, or walking. "This is a great time to try alternatives," said Scott. "UCSC's commute programs are low cost or free, and people may find they really like them." People who pledge to use a transportation alternative during California Rideshare Week become eligible for prizes that include a trip around the world.

        <title>Senate letter regarding new 'mail ballot' on grades</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  Dear Colleagues,
</p>

<p>
  The Senate leaders and Office have received many inquiries regarding the status of the mail ballot on mandatory grades. Although somewhat premature, this note is to inform the Senate that all necessary materials for the ballot have already been collected and given to the Committee on Rules, Jurisdiction, and Elections (RJ&E) for review. After any required changes and final approval by RJ&E, another week is then needed for the Senate Office to print and prepare the ballots before distribution to all Senators. Assuming no unanticipated delays, Senators can expect to receive the ballots well before mid-October and a due date roughly two weeks later. We are optimistic that the final count by RJ&E will be completed before the first regular Senate meeting scheduled for 9 Nov 2000.<br>
  <br>
  Respectfully yours,<br>
  <br>
  David Koo<br>
  Secretary, Santa Cruz Division

        <title>State funds raises for lower-paid university employees</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  Many university employees will enjoy slightly bigger paychecks November 1, when a systemwide salary augmentation program kicks in.<br>
</p>

<p>
  The University of California received a special one-time allotment of $19 million in the state budget to increase salaries of lower-paid employees. The augmentation, as well as regular annual merit increases for employees who are not represented by unions, takes effect October 1 and will appear in November paychecks.<br>
</p>

<p>
  "This is good news," said Willeen McQuitta, director of staff human resources at UCSC. "The university is recognizing that lower-paid staff, particularly, deserve an across-the-board salary boost, in addition to the merit increases."<br>
</p>

<p>
  Eligible employees who earn $40,000 or less will receive an additional 2 percent salary increase. Those who earn between $40,000 and $80,000 will receive a 1 percent salary increase. All nonrepresented clerical employees will receive a 2 percent salary increase, regardless of their current salary. These increases will be applied to salaries before annual merit increases are calculated.<br>
</p>

<p>
  In addition, nonrepresented clerical staff who receive a performance rating of "met expectations" or better will receive an additional 1 percent after the merit process.<br>
</p>

<p>
  Increases for union-represented employees must be negotiated before they can be implemented, and talks are under way between the university and union representatives, said McQuitta.

  <br>
  Erik Asphaug studies asteroids and comets, focusing on their geologic mysteries and the collisions and tidal effects that shape their evolution. His research addresses the potential hazards posed by near-Earth asteroids and the possibility of diverting them or extracting resources from them. He also explores the roles of comets and asteroids in the evolution of planets and their satellites (moons) and the giant impacts (e.g., asteroids hitting planets) that occurred in the early solar system. Asphaug received his B.A. in mathematics and English from Rice University and his Ph.D. in planetary sciences from the University of Arizona, Tucson. He was a principal investigator at the SETI Institute and NASA Ames Research Center before coming to UCSC in 1998 as an associate researcher in the Institute of Tectonics.

  <br>
  Thomas Banks is an expert in theoretical elementary particle physics, cosmology, and superstring theory. He is affiliated with the Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics (SCIPP). Banks has made important contributions to many of the central theories of quantum mechanics and particle physics and is one of the leaders in the field of string cosmology. He made a key observation showing that Stephen Hawking's proposal that black hole evaporation violates a principle of quantum mechanics was untenable. With several colleagues, he proposed the first formulation of superstring theory not based on approximations. Banks earned his Ph.D. in physics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He was a professor of physics at UCSC from 1986 to 1990 and has now returned to the campus after ten years on the faculty at Rutgers University.<br>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  Normally at this time of year music professor and Dean of Arts Edward Houghton is immersed in planning and administration meetings, dealing with the hectic demands that arise at the beginning of every quarter. But this year is different. This year, Houghton will spend early October in Berlin, attending the opening performances of the German Symphony Orchestra and Chamber Chorus, conducted by one of his former students and featuring Houghton's edition of a Renaissance mass. The former student is conductor Kent Nagano, who graduated with degrees in music and sociology in 1974. It's been a stellar year for the world-famous conductor, who is not only the new music director of the German Symphony Orchestra but also accepted the position of principal conductor of the Los Angeles Opera in June. Nagano wanted to do something special for his inaugural performance with the Symphony (officially the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester und Kammerchor), and called his former teacher to discuss ideas.
</p>

<p>
  The result is a unique concert featuring Mahler's "Ninth Symphony" and a Renaissance mass that Houghton researched and translated into modern musical notation for this performance, which will be performed October 8 and 9, featuring the Tallis Scholars.
</p>

<p>
  "Kent has chosen a masterwork from the 15th century and one from the 20th century," Houghton said. "He's creating a lot of excitement in Berlin and Europe with his imaginative opening program."<br>
  <br>
  The 15th-century piece is Houghton's edition of Johannes Ockeghem's <i>Missa Au travail suis.</i> The mass is one of 40 works (known all together as the <i>Chigi Codex</i>) that Houghton has been preparing for publication by the University of Chicago Press.
</p>

<p>
  Because the works are very old, the musical notation is quite different from modern notation--Houghton says that the difference between the notation in the <i>Chigi Codex</i> and modern notation is somewhat comparable to the difference between Latin and modern French. Houghton has conducted meticulous research to recreate the ancient works so that they can be revived by modern performers.<br>
  <br>
  Although the bulk of his work was done before the performance, Houghton isn't completely off the hook. Nagano decided that he wanted to hold an academic symposium, at the National Institute for Music Research, in conjunction with the concert series. And, of course, Houghton will be a featured speaker.<br>

<p>
  It was all smiles and high-fives when Katrina Cope and her fitness instructor Ryan Andrews reviewed the results of Cope's second fitness evaluation at the end of the summer.
</p>Cope, who began working out regularly in Andrews's lunch-hour weight-training class six months ago, was pleased to see that her percentage of body fat was down and her strength was up.<br>
<p>
  But what has really delighted Cope was greater muscle definition. "These look impressive," she said, pointing to new bulges on her shoulder. "My husband says that I never had muscles on my shoulders before."<br>
</p>
<p>
  The evaluation tests, which are available to faculty, staff, and students for $30, measure cardiovascular capacity, flexibility, strength, weight, and body composition. Cope had made improvements in all areas.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "You're doing awesome. You really are," he told Cope. "I didn't expect this. I expected you'd be a little above where you were six months ago, but you're way above."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Cope had lost 4 pounds of fat and added 1.5 pounds of muscle. Her body fat crept down from 30.8 percent to 29 percent. Her flexibility test results soared from 14.75 inches to 20 inches, and in two of the three strength tests, Cope exceeded the range for her age. "I'm off the charts!" she said, joking with Andrews.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Next? Cope wants to bring her body fat down more, and she is consulting with Andrews about tailoring her workout toward activities that will help her hit the 25 percent body fat mark in the next six to 12 months.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "I know you were hoping for a little more in that area, but body fat is super slow to change," said Andrews. "Your aerobic capacity is really good. The more muscle mass you build up, the more calories you need to sustain that mass." Aerobic exercise, he noted, speeds up metabolism and the rate at which calories are burned.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Notably absent from their discussion was any talk of quitting. Cope, a career adviser in Hahn Student Services, has overcome the challenge of motivation. She attended every express workout over the summer--except when she was on vacation or recuperating from minor surgery, and she is now inspiring coworkers, including her supervisor, Joan Walker, to join the Wellness Center. Cope and Walker participated in the summer Adopt-a-Slug exercise mentorship program. Walker got a great complimentary introduction to the Wellness Center and to weight training, and Cope got a T-shirt out of the deal.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "I felt pretty unhealthy when I started the lunchtime Express Workout program in February," said Cope. "It's such a blessing to have a facility like this, to have the support of my supervisor, and now to have her working out with me."<br>

<p>
  NASA Ames Research Center The University of California, Santa Cruz, San Jose State University, and the Foothill-De Anza Community College District have formed the "Collaborative," an innovative partnership to address Silicon Valley's critical education and workforce needs through joint research and education programs to be located at the proposed NASA Research Park at Moffett Field.
</p>Top officials from the three academic institutions and NASA held a news conference at NASA Ames on September 5 to discuss this unprecedented action. Participants included M.R.C. Greenwood, chancellor of UC Santa Cruz; Robert L. Caret, president of San Jose State University (SJSU); Leo Chavez, chancellor of the Community College District; and NASA Ames Research Center Director Henry McDonald. Former State Senator Becky Morgan served as master of ceremonies.
<p>
  "Our goal is to develop a world-class, shared-use R&D campus by partnering with industry, academia, and nonprofits in the NASA Research Park," McDonald said. "I am delighted that the NASA Research Park provided the impetus for a number of our academic planning partners to form this unprecedented partnership for education programs that will be conducted here."<br>
  <br>
  "While Silicon Valley is recognized worldwide for its innovation, high technology, and as a catalyst for change, the area also faces a critical shortage of teachers and engineers," said Greenwood. "We wondered what public higher education could accomplish if we focused our collective energy and resources on a shared solution. By crossing traditional boundaries, our collaboration with San Jose State and Foothill-De Anza will leverage our collective strength, provide innovative programs and services, and produce results of value to Silicon Valley and the State of California."<br>
  <br>
  "The NASA-Collaborative provides us with a unique opportunity to serve the needs of this region together," said Caret. "Since each of our organizations had signed separate planning agreements with NASA Ames for joint efforts in the NASA Research Park, we decided that we could be a stronger force if we worked collectively on the critical Silicon Valley needs. The NASA Research Park will provide the optimal environment for collaboration. Through these collaborative programs, we look forward to building a world-class facility that will house teaching, research, and economic development programs for the Silicon Valley and the State of California."<br>
  <br>
  "By working together, the Collaborative hopes to leverage its collective talent, resources, and intellectual leadership to solve the valley's increasing demand for education and workforce development," said Chavez. "In terms of work-force preparation, higher education needs to go the extra mile to meet the needs of our community, especially to prepare underrepresented groups and minorities for jobs in the high-tech Silicon Valley."
</p>
<p>
  "By collaborating with the best in higher education, other partners of the NASA Research Park and NASA Ames' extensive resources, the Collaborative will offer Silicon Valley a visionary opportunity for advancement," said Bernadine Chuck Fong, president of Foothill College. "To make a difference in the lives of Silicon Valley students historically underrepresented in higher education, De Anza College is proud to partner with NASA, UCSC, SJSU, Foothill, and our local high schools to provide new educational models to give our students the math, science and technology skills they must have to be successful in our new economy," said Martha Kanter, president of De Anza College.<br>
  <br>
  "This is not business as usual. Over the last several months, we have crafted a shared vision, strengthened our relationships and are now eager to roll up our sleeves and do the hard work for the benefit of the region," Greenwood said.<br>
  <br>
  Founded in 1965, the University of California Santa Cruz is developing its Silicon Valley Center, which is expected to be located at the proposed NASA Research Park at Moffett Field. The main campus is situated on 2,000 acres of redwood forest and meadows, overlooking Monterey Bay. UC Santa Cruz also operates the Monterey Bay Education, Science and Technology Center (MBEST) on 1,000 acres of the former Fort Ord in Monterey County. Nationally recognized in astronomy/astrophysics, economics, and education among other disciplines, UC Santa Cruz enrolls approximately 12,000 students who study a variety of majors in natural sciences, engineering, social sciences, arts, and humanities.<br>
  <br>
  Founded in 1857, San Jose State University (SJSU) was the first public institution of higher learning established on the West Coast. From its beginnings as a normal school to train teachers for the developing frontier, SJSU has become Silicon Valley's "Metropolitan University," with an enrollment of 27,000 students. Through its eight colleges the university offers bacheloris and masteris degrees in 134 programs. The university's College of Engineering is ranked as one of the nation's best. The university's location in the Silicon Valley makes it an exceptionally rewarding learning environment for students. Silicon Valley firms and agencies seek SJSU students for internships, summer work programs, and for assistance with research projects.<br>
  <br>
  The Foothill-De Anza Community College District was founded in 1957 to serve residents of Cupertino, Los Altos, Los Altos Hills, Mountain View, Palo Alto, Sunnyvale, and portions of Santa Clara and San Jose. The district also serves as the primary high school to community college link to the Fremont Union, Mountain View-Los Altos Union and Palo Alto Unified high school districts. District officials say the challenge of the 21st century includes the need to serve a growing and diverse student population. Since 1957, Foothill-De Anza has responded to the needs of more than one million students who have enrolled in its day, evening, off campus, and online courses. The innovative workforce that has transformed the Silicon Valley is comprised of more than 500,000 former Foothill-De Anza students.<br>
  <br>
  NASA Ames Research Center recently announced the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) process under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) regulations to develop the land at Moffett Field under NASA ownership. The proposed developments include the area called the NASA Research Park in which the academic, industry, and nonprofit partners hope to conduct their research and education programs. NASA Ames has a vibrant education outreach program, hosting many events onsite and delivering NASA education materials to classrooms nationally. NASA plans to develop with these academic and nonprofit partners a teacher institute, which will include teacher enhancement programs, development of multimedia products for students and teachers, and host onsite and internet-based education events. NASA Ames is partnering with organizations to conduct research in astrobiology, nanotechnology, information technology, and other aerospace-related research areas.<br>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  Beat parking hassles, the traffic blues, and the high price of gasoline by riding your bicycle on Bike to Work/School Day on Thursday, October 5.
</p>

<p>
  Bicyclists will be treated to a free breakfast at 12 sites throughout Santa Cruz County, free commuter massages, free bike mechanical repair, and a chance to win a trip around the world.
</p>

<p>
  Free breakfast locations include the Bike Co-op at the UCSC Student Center.<br>
  <br>
  The folks at Bike to Work are serving up many great incentives to entice you to leave your car at home. How about a breakfast of Beckmann's muffins, Noah's Bagels, Martinelli juice, Jamba Juice, and Peet's coffee--free for all cyclists on Bike to Work Day.<br>
  <br>
  In addition, drastically reduced light systems, bike headlights, rear flashing lights, and batteries will be on sale for $5 at selected Bike to Work Day breakfast sites. The low-cost bike lights are provided by the Community Traffic Safety Coalition.
</p>

<p>
  "Fall is an excellent time to outfit your bike with lights as there is less daylight in the day," explains Bike to Work program director Piet Canin. "The theme for the fall event is be bright; use a light at night."
</p>

<p>
  For bike commuters who want to really light up the road at night, Light & Motion will be discounting their high-end rechargeable lights at the Santa Cruz downtown breakfast site.
</p>

<p>
  For a full list of breakfast sites or other information, call Bike to Work at (831) 423-3773 or go to <a href="http://www.bike2work.com">www.bike2work.com</a>.<br>
  <br>
  Bike to Work is sponsored by the Santa Cruz County Regional Transportation Commission, Spokesman Bicycles, Bicycle Trip, New Leaf Community Market, and many other businesses and organizations in Santa Cruz County.<br>

        <title>El Teatro de la Esperanza: Looking at the human condition through Chicano eyes</title>

<p>
  Rodrigo Duarte Clarke, playwright and artistic director of San Francisco's El Teatro de la Esperanza, is talking about the different ways that cultures deal with the same issues. He brings up his uncle, who lived in a small town in Sonora, Mexico.<br>
  <br>
  "When he was traveling to the next town, his wife would tell him he should put his coffin in the back of his cart. She believed that, above all, you shouldn't impose on people, and foremost in her mind was the possibility that he might die while visiting someone. And he did own his own coffin already. That's just the way death is treated in that culture/it's a part of life, not detached or hidden."<br>
</p><br>
For more than 30 years, Clarke has been in the business of depicting the human condition on stage through the particular sensibilities of Chicano/Latino culture. Clarke is a founding member of El Teatro de la Esperanza, which was formed in 1970 by a group of UC Santa Barbara students interested in seeing their experiences and viewpoints represented on the stage.<br>
<br>
The subject of death is especially pertinent now, as Clarke and actress Ruby Nelda Perez gear up to stage <i>Rosita's Day of the Dead,</i> the sequel to the highly successful <i>Dona Rosita's Jalapeno Kitchen.</i> Written and directed by Clarke, the one-woman show will be presented by <a href="http://events.ucsc.edu/artslecs/">Arts & Lectures</a> on Wednesday, October 11.<br>
<br>
The story opens in the kitchen of Dona Rosita, who is preparing food for El Dia de los Muertos (the Day of the Dead). Actress Perez depicts a wide range of characters, many of whom cajole and entreat the title character to reconcile with her dying father.<br>
<br>
"The play is about reconciliation and death. And you find out that as people die, it's not all that clean cut," Clarke says. "People put off dealing with these issues until the very end and then have to confront them at a very difficult time."<br>
<br>
Clarke says he wrote both the Rosita plays with Perez in mind. "She's such a wonderful actress, it's kind of crazy to do it without her. You could do the play using three of four actors and, in fact, <i>Kitchen</i> was performed that way by other companies around the country. But it was written for Ruby/I knew that she could do all of this. When you do have an actor who can pull it off, playing all the characters, that virtuosity becomes one of the wonderful elements of the piece."<br>
<br>
El Teatro de la Esperanza toured the first <i>Rosita</i> play two years ago (UCSC was fortunate enough to be on that tour), and the play was so successful that Clarke wrote this sequel. There may be a third play down the road as well.
<p>
  "It is rumored that this is a trilogy," Clarke teased, refusing to commit further. "I didn't even want to do a sequel at first, but then I heard I was doing it and, what could I do but write it? A third play could happen, but at this point I have no idea."<br>
  <br>
  The pieces El Teatro de la Esperanza stages are written by a range of authors but, generally, are new works written specifically for the company and are usually by a Chicano or Latino playwright.<br>
  <br>
  "All the work we produce incorporates Chicano/Latino culture. It can be through such elements as bilinguality or by raising pertinent social questions, but ultimately what is important is that we are fully entertaining and engage the audience in intellectual discourse. The play may be about a particular set of people, but it has to raise universal questions. And if it's good it will resonate with everyone, no matter what their culture."

        <title>UC will not block Napster on campuses</title>
        <pubDate>Fri, 22 Sep 2000 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>

        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  UC Office of the President The University of California will not move to block students' campus access to Napster, the legally disputed and controversial Internet file-sharing service. Howard E. King, the attorney for rock band Metallica and rap artist Dr. Dre, had asked 11 universities--including the UC campuses at Berkeley and Los Angeles--to respond by September 22 as to whether they would block the use of Napster on their campuses. "Given the fact that Napster technology may be used for legitimate purposes and that the university does not monitor the use of its electronic systems, we see no justification for a blanket block on access to Napster technology," UC General Counsel James E. Holst said in a reply to King's request. "Just as a copying machine can be used to reproduce written works illegally, so can Napster be used for illegal purposes," said James Dolgonas, UC assistant vice president for information systems and computing. "However, both also serve many valuable and legitimate purposes." Holst's letter added: "The University of California provides online services to its faculty, staff, and students to enable them to take advantage of the many resources available through the Internet as they fulfill their educational and research endeavors and perform their duties. "The Internet has become a basic tool in the academic setting and in the workplace. As a service provider, the university does not generally monitor the specific ways in which its systems are used." Although UC declined to block Napster access on campus, Holst's letter said that the university takes copyright infringement seriously. "The university does not condone unlawful activity, and we take appropriate steps when we are informed of any specific alleged infringing activity," Holst said. As required by the federal Digital Millennium Copyright Act, each campus has designated an agent to receive complaints about alleged copyright infringement. The letter from UC asks that the attorney report any known instances involving his clients' music on a university system to the "designated agent" for the appropriate campus "who will address your concerns promptly." Other campuses that received a similar inquiry from King, the musicians' attorney, are Boston, Columbia, Harvard, Princeton and Stanford universities, the Georgia and Massachusetts Institutes of Technology, the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor and the University of Virginia. The letter from King claims that students across the country are involved in "rampant copyright infringements encouraged and implemented by Internet site Napster." His letter asserted that: "Napster enables the transfer of musical works between users, without the consent of or payment to the lawful copyright owners. It is now estimated that more than 20 million users regularly commit copyright infringements through Napster by downloading or uploading copyrighted material, without consent of owners." A court hearing is expected in early October to determine whether Napster should be allowed to continue its services. In July, the U.S. District Court in San Francisco ordered Napster to stop users from trading copyrighted songs, but the Ninth Circuit appellate court has issued a stay of the decision pending the October hearing.

  Martha Zuniga, an associate professor of molecular, cellular, and developmental biology, is among ten Latino scientists whose achievements are featured in an exhibit at the Tech Museum of Innovation in San Jose. The exhibit, running from September 16 through October 15, is part of the museum's celebration of National Hispanic Heritage Month. The exhibit consists of a series of panels located throughout the Tech Museum's galleries that highlight the innovations and contributions of the ten scientists. Zuniga was invited to take part in a day of special activities at the museum on Saturday, September 16, during which she would talk with students and other visitors about the challenges and rewards of being a scientist. "I'm very excited about it," she said. "It will be interesting to see the other exhibits and to talk to the students who come to the museum." In addition to Zuniga, the featured scientists include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Albert Baez, physicist, President of Vivamos Mejor/USA
  </li>
  <li>George Castro, associate dean of College of Science, San Jose State University
  </li>
  <li>Mario Molina, chemist and atmospheric scientist, MIT
  </li>
  <li>Adriana Ocampo, planetary geologist, NASA
  </li>
  <li>Ellen Ochoa, astronaut, NASA
  </li>
  <li>Hector Ruiz, president and chief operating officer, AMD
  </li>
  <li>Richard Tapia, Noah Harding Professor for Computational and Applied Mathematics, Rice University
  </li>
  <li>Lydia Villa-Komaroff, vice president for research and graduate studies, Northwestern University
  </li>
  <li>Maria Elena Zavala, biologist, California State University, Northridge
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  According to Tech Museum officials, more than 1,700 students from the Alum Rock School District have scheduled visits to the museum to see the exhibit.<br>
  <br>
  "National Hispanic Heritage Month is a time for everyone to experience the many contributions Hispanics have made to the country," said Tech Museum President and CEO Peter Giles. "We hope that our monthlong cultural celebration will inspire future innovators from all backgrounds."<br>
  <br>
  Zuniga is well aware of the influence an accomplished scientist can have as an inspiration to young students. She recalled her excitement as a fifth grader in Laredo, Texas, when a scientist from the Johnson Space Center visited her school. "It made a huge impact on me," she said.<br>
  <br>
  Zuniga's research focuses on a key component of the immune system, the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. She studies the role of MHC molecules in the development of the immune system and is investigating the mechanisms by which certain viruses evade detection by the immune system. Her work is supported by the National Institutes of Health.<br>
  <br>
  Zuniga received her B.A. in zoology from the University of Texas, Austin, and her Ph.D. in biology from Yale University. She joined the biology faculty at UCSC in 1990. In addition to her research, she teaches undergraduate and graduate courses in immunology, virology, and advanced cell biology.<br>
  <br>
  Additional information about the exhibit is available on the web at <a href="http://www.thetech.org">www.thetech.org</a> or by calling (408) 294-8324.<br>

        <title>Regents approve salary increases for chancellors, other officials</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 18 Sep 2000 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  <a href="mailto:stephens@cats.ucsc.edu"><br></a>UC Office of the President The University of California Board of Regents has approved salary increases effective Oct. 1 for President Richard C. Atkinson, the 10 chancellors and other senior UC officials. Atkinson received a 3.5 percent pay increase, from $337,300 to $349,100 per year. Six of the 10 chancellors also received 3.5 percent increases; four others received raises of up to 4.3 percent. The average increase for the chancellors was 3.74 percent. Unlike the past two years, UC is not providing across-the-board, market-based equity increases for senior administrators this year. Senior administrators are eligible for basic merit-based salary increases from a 3.5 percent pool, the same funding level as for UC staff employees. In some cases, administrators were given additional increases beyond the basic merit-based increase to promote retention, improve a position's salary in the higher education market, or correct an internal pay misalignment. Many UC staff employees also will receive increases beyond the normal 3.5 percent pool this year, thanks to a special $19 million augmentation included in the state budget. Staff employees making $40,000 or less per year will receive an additional 2 percent increase, and those making between $40,000 and $80,000 will receive an additional 1 percent increase. (These increases are subject to collective bargaining requirements for union-represented employees.) The $19 million augmentation will not be used to increase salaries of employees making $80,000 or more. "We are focusing this year on improving compensation for lower-paid staff employees," said Judith W. Boyette, UC associate vice president for human resources and benefits. "Providing competitive compensation for our employees faculty, staff, and management will continue to be an important priority in the coming years because it has such a critical impact on the quality of our programs." UC, the legislature and Gov. Gray Davis are placing an emphasis on salary increases for lower-paid university employees this year for several reasons, Boyette said. Among them: Some UC positions currently pay less than comparable positions elsewhere, putting the university at a competitive disadvantage in recruitment and retention; housing prices have increased sharply in the strong California economy; and UC employees did not receive cost-of-living increases for three years during the recession of the early 1990s. For faculty, meanwhile, this year's state budget provides funding for the standard 2 percent range adjustment plus normal merit increases, along with a 1 percent parity adjustment to keep faculty pay competitive with that of comparable universities. UC undertook a major effort in the late 1990s to bring faculty pay up to market-competitive levels. Regents took action on management salaries today because Regental approval is needed to set salaries above the $168,000 level. By agreement with the California Postsecondary Education Commission, UC uses a market-based methodology to help set salaries for senior administrators. In this process, UC salaries are compared with those of 26 comparable public and private universities across the nation. The UC chancellors' average September 2000 salary of $270,500 lags the comparison group average by 19.4 percent, according to an independent survey by William M. Mercer, Inc. Two years of market-based equity adjustments had reduced the lag to an estimated 9.5 percent last year, but the gap has increased as other universities have increased compensation for top leadership. Beyond chancellors and the president, the Regents' action affects salaries for a range of senior administrators earning above $168,000, including certain vice presidents, officers of the Regents, medical center officials, vice chancellors, vice provosts, academic deans and other senior officials. They were eligible for basic merit-based salary increases averaging 3.5 percent, and some were given additional increases for purposes of retention, promotion, market competitiveness or internal pay alignment. Individual salaries affected by the Regental action are available upon request from UC Strategic Communications.

  Associate Producing Director/Director, <a href="http://www.theactingcompany.org/home.htm">The Acting Company</a><br>
  April 12: <i>O Pioneers!</i>
</h4>

<p>
  The New York-based company is now in its 30th year. The show that will be performed in Santa Cruz is the first in a five-part series conceived by Corley, which entailed commissioning five of the country's most brilliant contemporary playwrights to adapt great American novels for the stage. The play <i>O Pioneers!</i> was adapted by Darrah Cloud from the novel by Willa Cather, with music by Kim D. Sherman. It appeared originally on PBS' <i>American Playhouse.</i>
</p>

<p><hr>
<p>
  "Brecht said that theater should always be, more than anything, fun. If it wasn't fun, fundamentally, it wasn't worth doing. He was reacting against the very stodgy theater of the 19th century. It's ironic that the idea of musicals, which we think of as fluffy entertainment, was a concept that appealed to Brecht.<br>
  <br>
  I think theater should also be, fundamentally, a lens for you to look at society through, and to look at yourself. Good theater should incorporate psychology and history.<br>
  <br>
  There is something Kafka said about art being the ax that breaks up the frozen ocean inside of us. I always like that quote. Art should challenge us to think in different ways, and to get a broader perspective on ourselves in the world.<br>
  <br>
  In terms of what we aim to do, the Acting Company has a dual mission. First, we want to support the work of young actors and, second, to take theater to places around the country that don't get an opportunity to see it often. That mission gets at the other thing, aside from entertainment, that I think theater should do: Theater should educate.<br>
  <br>
  That word often has a bad connotation, in that it seems like you're going to be fed ideas. But it comes from educare, from Latin, which is to lead forth, to take someone to another place. That is exactly what good theater should do--take you to another place. We want to take people on a journey."<br>

  Artistic Director: <a href="http://www.johnlambert.ca/l2m_main.html">Les Deux Mondes</a><br>
  April 7: <i>Tale of Teeka</i>
</h4>

<p>
  <br>
  Established in 1973, the Montreal-based theater company has earned a reputation for dealing with controversial material in a forthright and compelling manner. <i>Tale of Teeka,</i> told from the viewpoint of the goose Teeka, is the story of a friendship between a young boy and his pet and deals with the issue of domestic violence. The powerful fable of survival has won numerous awards and been performed nearly 400 times in theaters around the world. As with all stories performed by Les Deux Mondes, Teeka was developed over several years through a unique collaborative process that involved the author, director, designers, actors, and adult and child audiences. Meilleur, whose English is far better than this reporter's French, valiantly communicated his ideas in his second language during a recent phone interview.
</p>

<p><hr>
<p>
  "Brecht always said that first what is important in theater is good entertainment, and I agree with him. In the case of <i>Tale of Teeka,</i> that is certainly true. It is entertaining. But that doesn't mean that it is only fun--the story touches on a part that exists deep inside each human being, which is our tendency to violence. Everyone is born with it and then, growing up, we learn to manage it in a way that enables us to live constructively in society.<br>
  <br>
  Another important aspect of theater is that it is performed by human beings--living, emotional humans. In that way, theater can touch a person very differently from television or movies, simply because the physical presence of the body delivers something more. That's why you have to tell the truth in theater--you can't get away with lies, it's obvious right away.<br>
  <br>
  Theater, also, is very tactile, and that is very important to me. That's why we involve all the designers from the beginning when we can. The way we are creating, the process of involving everyone, brings on the stage a synergy between all the arts that creates an incredibly rich and meaningful tapestry."

  January 26: <i>Cat on a Hot Tin Roof</i>

<p>
  A Noise Within, an acclaimed theater company from southern California, is dedicated to presenting classic plays. The company was founded in 1991 by American Conservatory Theater alumni Geoff Elliott, Julia Rodriguez Elliott, and Art Manke. The company houses a resident acting troupe that performs the season's plays in repertory. Geoff Elliott directs the upcoming performance of <i>Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.</i>

<p><hr>
<p>
  <b>GE:</b> For me, the purpose of theater is to tell a damn good story. One of the reasons I love the material we do is because we are working with excellent stories.<br>
  <br>
  We've become a society that has lost touch with itself in terms of being together in the same room. Live theater is so different than going to see a movie. At a play, you are seeing real people on stage, having the courage to do something in front of you as it happens, second by second; and you are in the same room with other living beings--touching shoulders, breathing the same air, watching the story unfold.<br>
  <br>
  During Aristotle's time, theater was like church--people went there to commune. It was a big deal to them. And over the years we've lost that sense. The truth of the matter is that, for me, there is something very special about live theater. It's almost like a religion, in that you're coming to commune with other people and possibly learn something about yourself<br>
  <br>
  <b>JRE:</b> Live theater is such a visceral experience. When we have students in the theater, quite often, they reach out to touch the actors. They're not trying to be disruptive, it's just that they're not used to having that kind of human contact. It is a whole different experience when you can touch a human being who has just been the vessel for this great story. You feel like you're participating in the experience. That kind of tangible energy is something the audience feel they've found on a journey with performers.<br>
  <br>
  <b>GE:</b> That's very true. No matter what kind of material we work with, whether it's Shakespeare, Shaw, or Chekov, the audience is given an opportunity to watch life unfolding in front of them. And I don't just mean the actual drama, but the real live actors who are going through their paces. The audience gets to see a living fingerprint--something that is only going to happen once. They can't rewind it and watch it again. And that's the reason I think theater so vital and interesting.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>
  Writer/Director/Actor/Composer<br>
  October 28: <i>Romeo Sierra Tango</i>
</h4>

<p>
  Eckert, the child of two opera singers, began performing at the age of five and never stopped. He writes, composes music for, performs, and frequently directs his own work, which has drawn unabashed praise from even the most jaded New York theater critics. Eckert has performed in every style imaginable, from, as he says, "the wildest avant-garde to most traditional opera--straight Shakespeare, bent Shakespeare, sung Shakespeare, Verdi, Puccini, Mozart, and Brecht." His own creations include solo pieces, full-length plays, musicals, and opera. <i>Romeo</i> is Eckert's own radical take on the character from the Shakespeare play.
</p>

<p><hr>
<p>
  "The purposes of theater are manifold. There are many levels of approach, and certainly entertainment is part of the quotient. But entertainment is a broad category. If you use the word 'fun,' well, for some people fun is going to the bowling alley while others would like to sit down and read Greek tragedy. And entertainment in Greek tragedy is a chorus coming in and telling you that Clytemnestra has slaughtered Agamemnon--it's not exactly <i>Pet Detective</i>. So there are real different conceptions of fun.<br>
  <br>
  What I like in theater is to have a variety of experiences--I like comedy and I like tragedy and I like them together. Sheer fun is important too, and I'm not above a pratfall. If a double take works, fine. Vaudeville? Song and dance? Great. But I also like intellectual turns. I like to stand things on their head and challenge the accepted visions of things. I like intellectual gymnastics. So the piece will go from a simple relationship with fun to a more complicated relationship with fun. I'm after an audience that wants to go to all those places.<br>
  <br>
  One thing I would say is that theater tends to be treated as if it's similar to, say, cinema. I think people tend to forget how old this medium is. It's an older art form than practically anything except maybe painting, which goes back to cave painting. I'm drawn by the sense of being an active participant in this ancient and venerable practice. It makes live theater an unbeatable event."

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>
  Artistic Director/Writer/Director, El Teatro de la Esperanza<br>
  October 11: <i>Rosita's Day of the Dead</i>
</h4>

<p>
  The San Francisco--based El Teatro de la Esperanza was born in 1970 out of the political sensibilities of a group of UC Santa Barbara students, interested in seeing their culture represented on the stage. The company performs original plays (many written by artistic director Clarke) about the human condition, but informed by the sensibilities of Chicano/Latino culture.
</p>

<p><hr>
<p>
  "My sense of the purpose of theater has probably changed over the years. El Teatro de la Esperanza comes out of the Chicano theater movement and, in the beginning stages, we were highly politicized students. As we have matured, I like to think that we're not so conscious of making our work so starkly political. Because they are coming from our cultural sensibility, our plays organically transfer a sense of that culture; but the emphasis is on the art, and we let the politics fall into place.<br>
  <br>
  But, for all theater, no matter what other purpose it has, I would side with Brecht, who felt that entertainment was an important aspect of theater. Of course, he used that term in a very different way from how it is used today: To him, entertainment meant pleasing the audience but, also, engaging them intellectually with questions that pertained to their lives.<br>
  <br>
  Ultimately, theater should engage audiences on specific questions, and, in our case, within a Chicano context. I think theater is only successful if you can find in it the humanity that we all share. <i>Rosita's Day of the Dead,</i> hopefully, has meaning for everyone, Chicano or not. It's about reconciliation and death--very universal issues about dying and how we arrive at peace with each other."

Aristotle wrote that theater should be, "a place of fun and pleasure"--a haven for audiences to escape to. With a few exceptions, his viewpoint held sway until the early 1900s when the experimentation of such thinkers as Russian director Konstantin Stanislavsky and German playwright Bertolt Brecht expanded the function of theater to something beyond pure entertainment.<br>
<br>
Since then, the boundaries of conventional theater have been continuously stretched and played with, generating a wide (and sometimes wild) array of performance experiences.
<p>
  That array will be well represented during the 2000-01 season of UCSC's Arts & Lectures program, when five very different companies bring their unique brand of theater to town. We spoke with the artistic directors of each of these companies to uncover their ideas on the function of theater. Their views are presented here in the order in which the companies will be appearing in Santa Cruz; and don't worry--although opinions varied on many things, everyone agreed that theater should be fun.<br>

<p>
  Brush the cobwebs off your creativity and create a seasonal sensation for the first-ever scarecrow contest that's being held in conjunction with the UCSC Farm's annual Harvest Festival on October 14.
</p><br>
The contest is open to the public, and the Center for Agroecology is extending a special invitation to UCSC staff, faculty, and students to create scarecrows that will be a centerpiece of the festival. Entries by individuals and teams of up to four campus members are encouraged.
<p>
  The annual Harvest Festival is a family-oriented event that features live music, events for children, food, gardening workshops, and an apple tasting of heirloom varieties.<br>
  <br>
  The scarecrow contest will begin at noon and will be judged by a panel of campus faculty and community members. Winners will be announced at 1 p.m.<br>
  <br>
  Everyone who enters the contest will receive free admission to the festival. Prizes will be awarded as follows to each creator or member of a winning team: First prize is a Farm & Garden T-shirt and a box of mixed fruits and vegetables; second prize is a box of mixed fruits and vegetables; third prize is a bouquet of fresh-cut flowers and a Farm & Garden coffee mug.<br>
  <br>
  Pre-entry registration is required by calling John Fisher at 459-3248 or sending<br>
  him e-mail at <a href="mailto:johnfish@cats.ucsc.edu">johnfish@cats.ucsc.edu</a>.<br>
  <br>
  All scarecrows must be dropped off at the UCSC Farm's back gate by 5:30 p.m. on October 13. Please be sure to attach a list of the name of each team member.<br>
  <br>
  The height of each scarecrow should not exceed seven feet, six inches, nor should it be less than five feet.<br>
  <br>
  For display purposes, please build your scarecrow on a pole and leave at least two feet below so the scarecrow can be freestanding after it is set in the ground.<br>
  <br>
  Near the end of the festival you may take your scarecrow home or donate it<br>
  to the Farm.<br>
  <br>

        <title>UCSC to hold third community meeting on plans for Long Marine Laboratory property</title>

<p>
  UCSC will hold a public workshop on Wednesday, October 4, to discuss progress toward developing a master plan for Long Marine Laboratory and the adjacent 55-acre property purchased last year from Wells Fargo Bank. The meeting will take place from 7 to 9 p.m. in the conference room of the Seymour Center at Long Marine Laboratory (100 Shaffer Road, Santa Cruz).
</p><br>
Anyone interested in this topic is urged to attend the workshop and provide input, share information, or ask questions.
<p>
  "The purpose of the workshop is twofold: We want to discuss the latest ideas our consultants have developed for the marine site, and we want to continue to receive public input about those ideas," said Charles Eadie, UCSC's director of campus and community planning.
</p>
<p>
  "While this is still very much an informal phase in the project, we are discussing a number of alternative ideas for the site, so it's very useful to receive input from the public as we refine those concepts."
</p>
<p>
  A UCSC planning committee, which includes representatives of the city of Santa Cruz and staff from the California Coastal Commission, has been working since last fall to develop plans for the Long Marine Lab site, including the 55 acres acquired by UCSC in spring 1999.
</p>
<p>
  In December, the committee adopted a set of planning principles for developing the site as a marine research and education center. These principles were first presented to the public at an open house last December and published in a document entitled <i>Planning Principles: Marine Research and Education Center.</i>
</p>
<p>
  The university has hired a consulting team--EHDD Architecture, a San Francisco firm that developed the original Long Marine Lab Master Plan over 20 years ago and also designed the Monterey Bay Aquarium; and BMS Planning Consultants, also from San Francisco--to prepare a master plan for the site. This past spring, the consultants and the planning committee met with interested parties in a series of focus-group workshops. Environmental groups, agricultural interests, and the Terrace Point Action Network were among the participants in the focus groups.
</p>
<p>
  At the second public meeting, held this past June, the consultants and the planning committee presented the input they had received from the focus groups and unveiled six different schematics, showing how the site might be developed as a marine research and education center.
</p>
<p>
  Since then, the consultants have prepared several more detailed refinements of planning alternatives for the site. The schematics offer different ways to incorporate research and educational facilities on the site. They also consider various approaches to preserving open space on the site while providing housing that would support the needs of the marine programs there.
</p>
<p>
  Following the October 4 community workshop, it is expected that the consultants will continue to refine a schematic for the site. Ultimately, the preferred plan will serve as the basis for the Coastal Long-Range Development Plan--and accompanying Environmental Impact Report--that the university will prepare for consideration by the UC Regents and the California Coastal Commission, probably sometime next year, Eadie said.<br>

  New findings on chronic lead contamination in San Francisco Bay were the focus of stories in the <i>San Francisco Chronicle, San Francisco Examiner, San Jose Mercury News, Santa Cruz Sentinel,</i> and on the <i>Environment Show</i> on National Public Radio, KRON (Channel 4), KTVU (Channel 2), and KGO radio. Featured in the stories were <b>Douglas Steding,</b> a doctoral candidate in Earth sciences and lead author of the study, and <b>Russell Flegal,</b> professor and chair of environmental toxicology. Steding was also interviewed by <i>Geotimes</i> magazine.
</p>

<p>
  McHenry Library staffer <b>Trent Eglin</b> penned an op-ed for the <i>Santa Cruz County Sentinel</i> taking UC to task for its differential treatment of administrators and staff employees.
</p>

<p>
  Any time subliminal advertising hits the news, psychologist <b>Anthony Pratkanis's</b> phone starts to ring. That was the case last week when news of possible monkey business in George W. Bush's presidential campaign ads made headlines. Among the callers were ABC News and several newspapers around the country.
</p>

<p>
  Alan Chadwick, the inspiration behind what is now the <b>Alan Chadwick Garden</b> on campus, was the subject of a recent KSCO radio program. . . . The <i>Santa Cruz County Sentinel</i> did a nice photo spread in advance of the <b>Farm & Garden's</b> annual fall plant sale.

<p>
  The use of lead as a gasoline additive was phased out years ago in California, but an enormous reservoir of lead-contaminated soils and river sediments remains in the Central Valley and will continue to contaminate the waters of San Francisco Bay for decades to come, according to a study by UCSC researchers.
</p><br>
The findings, published in the September 12 issue of the <i>Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,</i> are based on an analysis of lead in water samples collected over a ten-year period in San Francisco Bay and the mouths of the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers.
<p>
  Although there is no evidence that lead pollution in San Francisco Bay threatens the health of humans or marine organisms, the study has implications for the persistence of a wide range of potentially harmful contaminants, said Russell Flegal, professor and chair of environmental toxicology.<br>
  <br>
  "We can use this as a model for other contaminants, and it shows that many contaminants simply don't go away once you stop polluting the environment," Flegal said. "We're seeing lead contamination from the 1960s still coming into the bay, and our calculations indicate it will be another 50 to 100 years before all the lead from gasoline emissions in the Central Valley is washed into the bay."<br>
  <br>
  Even after lead stops entering the bay, lead-contaminated sediments are likely to remain there indefinitely, he added. These findings contrast with those of other researchers who have reported significant reductions of lead contamination in other types of environments. Since the phaseout of leaded gasoline, lead concentrations have fallen in urban air, ocean surface water, polar ice and snow, and even human blood. But the UCSC researchers now show that contaminated rivers and estuaries can retain pollutants like lead for a very long time.<br>
  <br>
  Douglas Steding, a graduate student in Flegal's lab, is the first author of the study. The coauthors are Flegal and Charles Dunlap, a research fellow in the Environmental Toxicology Department and an assistant professor at the American University of Armenia.<br>
  <br>
  Three factors conspire to maintain elevated levels of lead in the waters of San Francisco Bay, Steding said. One is the large amount of lead that remains in the Central Valley watershed, where it is associated with soils that gradually wash into the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers and flow into the bay. A second factor is the large amount of lead-contaminated sediments within the bay, which continually release lead into the water. The third factor is the limited transport of contaminated sediments from the bay into the open ocean.<br>
  <br>
  "The bay just doesn't clean itself efficiently," Steding said. "The only outflow is through the Golden Gate, so sediment flow out of the bay is limited."<br>
  <br>
  Furthermore, that flow has been drastically reduced by diversions of water from streams around the bay for urban, industrial, and agricultural uses. Contaminated sediments in the southern reach of the bay seem likely to remain there indefinitely, the researchers found.<br>
  <br>
  "There is very little movement of sediments out of the South Bay," Steding said. "It's akin to a stagnant lagoon, and only during periods of high water flow does it get any substantial flushing."<br>
  <br>
  Steding was able to analyze water samples from the bay and determine not only how much of the lead in a given sample came from gasoline, but how much came from, for example, gasoline produced in the 1960s and 1970s. Lead's unique elemental properties made this possible, he said. Different forms of lead, called stable isotopes, occur naturally, and their proportions can indicate the origins of the lead in a sample.<br>
  <br>
  "Lead has a unique isotopic variability that allows us to fingerprint the sources," Steding said.<br>
  <br>
  The results showed that gasoline emissions from the 1960s and 1970s still account for most of the lead in water samples from the rivers and bay. Leaded gasoline consumption peaked in the mid-1970s. The researchers estimated that cars burning leaded gasoline emitted 33,000 tons of lead in the Sacramento and San Joaquin drainage basins in the 1960s and 1970s.<br>
  <br>
  In the South Bay, 1960s and 1970s gasoline lead still accounts for 90 percent of the lead found in water samples. Moreover, this percentage remained unchanged throughout the study period, from 1989 to 1998. In the North Bay and the rivers, however, the proportion of lead from the 1960s and 1970s declined by 5 to 10 percent relative to lead from 1980s gasoline emissions.<br>
  <br>
  The researchers found that only 1 to 10 percent of the total amount of lead deposited in the Central Valley during the drought years of 1986-92 had been washed into the bay by 1995. The study also indicated that lead from 1980s gasoline is more readily mobilized by surface runoff than lead from 1960s and 1970s gasoline, which is probably located deeper in California soils and in the sediments of the river beds.<br>
  <br>
  According to Flegal, other heavy metals and some organic pollutants are likely to show similar patterns of persistence in the environment. These include contaminants, such as mercury, that are serious problems in San Francisco Bay, posing threats to humans and wildlife.<br>
  <br>
  "We can't fingerprint these other contaminants, but we know they cycle like lead does in the environment," Flegal said.<br>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h4>
  First day of instruction is Wednesday, September 20
</h4>

<p>
  The first day of classes in the 2000-01 school year at UC Santa Cruz is Wednesday, September 20. Students began moving into university housing on Thursday, September 14, and were scheduled to continue doing so through Saturday, September 16. Here are some facts and figures about this year's student body, what the campus is doing to house students, and the new academic programs the campus is offering:
</p>

<h3>
  Enrollment:
</h3>

<ul>
  <li>UCSC is expecting an opening-day enrollment of approximately 11,900 students, 598 more students than were officially enrolled last fall (11,302). Enrollment totals become official following the third week of instruction.
  </li>
  <li>Of the 11,900 students, approximately 10,800 are expected to be undergraduates; 1,100 are expected to enroll in graduate studies.
  </li>
  <li>Of the undergraduates expected to enroll, approximately 3,900 will be new students (freshmen and transfer students).
  </li>
  <li>These 3,900 new undergraduates were admitted from among 20,624 applicants, a record number for undergraduate admission.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
  Profile of New Freshmen:
</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Approximately 2,970 of the 3,900 new undergraduates expected will be freshmen.
  </li>
  <li>Of the total number of freshmen expected, 1,049 identified themselves as African American, Chicano, Latino, American Indian, or Asian/Asian American, a 30 percent increase in the total from those ethnic groups last fall.
  </li>
  <li>The two most popular majors among freshmen who have already declared are biology (310) and psychology (206). The Jack Baskin School of Engineering, beginning its fourth fall, attracted 243 freshmen who declared in the following majors: Computer Science (153), Computer Engineering (65), Electrical Engineering (16), and Information Systems Management (9).
  </li>
  <li>Among the freshmen expected to enroll at UCSC this fall are 44 Regents Scholars. Among the most academically accomplished high school graduates, these students will receive UC's most prestigious scholarship, which covers all university fees for four years. The number of Regents Scholars who have accepted UCSC's offer to enroll has nearly tripled since 1995, when 16 students enrolled. This year's Regents Scholars have an average grade-point average of 4.2 and average SAT scores of 1406. Eleven other new students, transferring to UCSC this fall, qualified for the same scholarship; among new and continuing students, UCSC's student body now includes 191 Regents Scholars.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
  Housing UCSC Students:
</h3>

<ul>
  <li>To help offset a shortage of rental housing in the surrounding community, UCSC has increased its undergraduate housing capacity by 915 bed spaces in the past three years--from 4,233 in fall 1997 to 5,148 this fall.
  </li>
  <li>In addition, on-campus housing includes accommodations for 82 graduate students in the campus's Graduate Student Apartments near Kresge College, apartments for approximately 250 students in Family Student Housing, and space for 50 students in the campus's RV Park.
  </li>
  <li>This year is the first that new apartments at College Nine will be occupied. The new housing is providing accommodations for 315 students.
  </li>
  <li>Off campus, UCSC has leased a block of rooms (53) from the Holiday Inn on Ocean Street, housing 83 students in what is called the "UCSC Inn." UCSC's total housing capacity also includes 86 students who will occupy 54 apartments in the University Town Center on Pacific Avenue. (An additional 20 bed spaces in the center are reserved for UCSC Extension students enrolled in the English Language International Program.)
  </li>
  <li>In all, the campus will be housing 44 percent of its student body in university-sponsored housing, the highest percentage of any UC campus.
  </li>
  <li>In addition to students who will reside in university-sponsored housing, UCSC has secured 166 rooms in 13 local motels participating in the Slug Housing Partnership Program. In its fourth year, this program links students with local motels, which rent rooms to students on a monthly basis during the academic year (when there is less tourist demand for rooms).
  </li>
  <li>UCSC is continuing to build housing for students this year: some 400 new bed spaces are expected to be available next fall with the opening of the College Nine residence halls; College Ten residence halls, also providing housing for 400, will open a year later, in fall 2002. The Village, which had provided modular housing for students on the Colleges Nine and Ten site, is also expected to reopen next fall in the Lower Quarry area of the campus, providing housing for 153 students.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>
  New Programs for UCSC Students:
</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The Anthropology Department has added Ph.D. concentrations in Archaeology and Physical Anthropology.
  </li>
  <li>The Biology Department has split into two departments: the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology; and the Department of Molecular, Cell and Developmental Biology. The undergraduate curriculum and the various biology majors, including a new Ecology and Evolution major, will be administered jointly by the two departments.
  </li>
  <li>The Earth Sciences Department has added a Ph.D. concentration in Geochemistry.
  </li>
  <li>Electrical Engineering has attained departmental status and has a bachelor's program.
  </li>
  <li>Environmental Toxicology has attained departmental status, with M.S. and Ph.D. programs.
  </li>
  <li>The History Department is administering a new interdisciplinary undergraduate major and minor in Classical Studies.
  </li>
  <li>The Literature Department is administering a new interdisciplinary undergraduate minor in Jewish Studies.
  </li>
  <li>The Music Department has established a new undergraduate minor in jazz.
  </li>
  <li>The Philosophy Department has established new master's and Ph.D. programs.
  </li>
  <li>The Writing Program is offering a new undergraduate minor in Communication and Rhetoric.
  </li>
</ul>

        <title>EPC gets $3.7 million grant to help get Watsonville students on the path to college</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  Watsonville students will get a boost on their way to college from UCSC, which has received a $3.7 million, five-year federal grant to help disadvantaged students prepare for college. The funding, the initial installment of which is $500,902, comes from the U.S. Department of Education's GEAR UP program, which stands for Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs. The mission of GEAR UP is to increase the number of low-income students who are prepared to enter and succeed in postsecondary education. The Educational Partnership Center (EPC) at UCSC will administer the grant, which is part of $45.6 million in new GEAR UP funding announced by President Clinton on September 12. "GEAR UP is a partnership with low-income kids that says if you'll aim high and aspire to college, we'll help you get there with counseling, mentoring, tutoring and financial aid," Clinton said. "It sends a message that with hope, hard work, and high hopes--high expectations, you can go as far as your abilities will take you." Locally, the funding will support programs at Watsonville High School and its feeder middle schools. More than 80 percent of students in the participating Watsonville schools are Hispanic. In addition, 48 percent have limited English proficiency, and 33 percent are children of Mexican migrant families. Only 10 percent of the adults in the community have completed a bachelor's degree, and the academic performance of the students is well below average in almost every indicator. The Watsonville program will focus on "gatekeeping" college-preparatory mathematics courses that students must complete to continue on the path to college, said Carrol Moran, director of EPC.

<p>
  Math instruction will emphasize real-life problem-solving skills and will be enhanced by peer study groups and cross-age tutoring. A college-bound awareness curriculum will be introduced, emphasizing motivation and goal setting, study skills, information about college-eligibility requirements, scholarships, and summer programs.<br>
  <br>
  "We want to increase students' awareness of college and help motivate them to aim for it," said Moran. "Building expectations is key, and we will work to build a school culture in which students, staff, and families expect that all students can go to college."<br>
  <br>
  "Our goal is to ensure that Watsonville students are prepared for college and succeed once they get there," said John Casey, superintendent of the Pajaro Valley Unified School District. A strong family component will increase the involvement of parents, siblings, and other relatives, he added.<br>
  <br>
  Diane Siri, superintendent of the Santa Cruz County Office of Education, also expressed enthusiasm about the project. "As a former math teacher, I'm excited to see the focus on math education and training of math teachers," she said. "Lack of confidence and low math achievement should not be a college barrier for any student, especially for young women and underrepresented populations."<br>
  <br>
  With the GEAR UP announcement, U.S. Secretary of Education Richard W. Riley endorsed the need for early college planning. "Studies have shown that disadvantaged students are often not aware of the need to take academically rigorous college courses such as trigonometry and chemistry, or of the availability of financial aid," he said. "GEAR UP shows students that the key to college is preparation, and with financial aid, college can be affordable."<br>
  <br>
  Through GEAR UP, high-poverty middle schools partner with community and business organizations and local colleges and universities to provide all students at a particular grade level (typically beginning with sixth or seventh grade) and their families with comprehensive support services to prepare for college. Services include enhanced curricular offerings, summer academies, information about college options and the college application process, and financial aid. The program offers academic preparation and higher-level course work to each class of participating students during middle school and throughout high school.<br>
  <br>
  The grant application process was competitive, and only about one-third of all GEAR UP applications were funded. Grant recipients must match federal funding and partners may contribute in-kind support for their match. In addition to financial commitments, grantees must demonstrate a commitment to involve parents and to undertake lasting reform efforts to strengthen the curriculum for all students and to provide the kinds of support services that disadvantaged youth need to succeed in higher education.<br>
  <br>
  Low-income and minority students attend college at disproportionately low rates, said Riley, who expressed confidence that GEAR UP programs will expand college opportunities for thousands of young people.<br>

        <title>Mellon grant supports UC experiments in managing digital and print libraries</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 11 Sep 2000 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  <a href="mailto:stephens@cats.ucsc.edu"><br></a>UC Office of the President
</p>

<p>
  As access to information in digital form has become widely accepted among scholars, the next challenge for research libraries will be managing and preserving information resources in both print and electronic collections. The Andrew W. Mellon Foundation and University of California are collaborating to explore new approaches to best manage these dual collections.<br>
  <br>
  To this end, the UC system has received an $80,000 grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation that will be the first step in an extensive study of the issues involved in managing research library collections of print and digital materials. The planning grant will support design of research goals and methodology of the study, scheduled to begin in January.<br>
  <br>
  Through a variety of channels, including UC's Systemwide Library and Scholarly Information Advisory Committee, university faculty, administrators, and librarians are helping to frame the questions that the study will address. Participants are eager to discover ways that UC can leverage its considerable investment in digital library collections by providing its libraries greater flexibility in managing their print collections.<br>
  <br>
  The study will test the hypothesis that shared digital resources can begin to relieve the pressure on physical facilities and capital budgets to house and manage print materials.
</p>

<p>
  The proposed experiment is critically important to UC, and the lessons learned are likely to be of considerable interest to academic and research library communities nationally.<br>
  <br>
  "The University of California is a national leader in creating digital libraries and exploring new forms of scholarly communication," said UC President Richard C. Atkinson. "We are delighted to have the Mellon Foundation as a partner in this exciting initiative, which will help us answer some important questions about making the best use of both our digital and our print collections."<br>
  <br>
  In awarding the grant to UC, Mellon Foundation President William G. Bowen, wrote to Atkinson that, while the grant "is modest in size, it is in support of a very important initiative."<br>
  <br>
  Like other research universities, the University of California has a strong interest in managing its existing library facilities to accommodate continually growing collections.<br>
  <br>
  Additionally, due to the pressures within California of significant enrollment growth and the need to address urgent seismic safety deficiencies and replace deteriorating campus infrastructure, UC is faced with competing demands for capital funding. One way to meet these demands is to use digital technologies to assist in managing library collections. However, some aspects of the technologies and the methods and costs of ensuring durable digital archives are not well-studied or entirely resolved.<br>
  <br>
  The study planning will include details of an experiment involving the withdrawal from the UC campuses of a group of journal titles that are represented in their library collections in both print and digital formats. During the course of the experiment, faculty and students will rely on the digital versions of these titles to meet their information needs. Persistent access to these materials will be ensured by depositing a print version in the UC's regional library facilities.<br>
  <br>
  The University of California is well-positioned to undertake this experiment since it has a history of successful collaboration among the UC campus libraries that includes the development of a shared union catalog, a shared collection development and acquisitions program, two regional library facilities, and an intercampus resource sharing program.
</p>

<p>
  Since the mid-1970s, UC has been guided by the principle that the library collections of all the campuses should be considered as a single university collection rather than as separate collections.<br>
  <br>
  "Access to digital materials, which the UC community focuses on through the California Digital Library, is constantly improving in quantity and quality," said Richard E. Lucier, UC's executive director for systemwide planning for libraries and scholarly information.
</p>

<p>
  "The timing is good and the rationale strong for examining the advantages that digital resources will provide in managing print collections, including those of handling fewer copies of print materials when digital counterparts are available."<br>
  <br>

<p>
  The Science Matters Book Club, which meets each month during the school year at the Central Branch of the Santa Cruz Public Library, 225 Church Street, holds its next meeting on Sunday, September 24, from 2 to 4
</p>p.m.
<p>
  Science journalist Robert Irion will lead a discussion of <i>One Universe: At Home in the Cosmos,</i> a book Irion coauthored with Neil de Grasse Tyson, the director of the Hayden Planetarium in New York, and Charles Liu, an astrophysicist at the American Museum of Natural History.<br>
  <br>
  The book club is open to the general public and focuses on nontechnical science books. Each discussion is led by a member of the local scientific community with expertise in the subject of that month's book. Meetings are usually on the third Sunday of each month.<br>
  <br>
  This month's meeting features a beautifully illustrated book that takes readers on an enjoyable and informative tour of the cosmos. A <i>New York Times</i> review described it as "an insightful primer on all things great and small," and noted the "mind-blowing revelations" in store for readers.<br>
  <br>
  Irion is a freelance science writer who lives in Santa Cruz. He is a contributing editor at <i>Astronomy</i> magazine and a contributing correspondent to <i>Science</i> magazine. He previously worked on campus as a science writer in the Public Information Office. Irion earned a B.S. in earth and planetary science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and studied science communication at UC Santa Cruz, where he now teaches science writing.<br>
  <br>
  The book club is sponsored by the Santa Cruz Public Libraries, the UC Santa Cruz Science Library, the Cabrillo College Library, the Association for Women in Science--Monterey Bay, the Capitola Book Cafe, and the Santa Cruz City Museum of Natural History. The Capitola Book Cafe offers a 10 percent discount to members of the book club for the monthly selections.<br>
  <br>
  For more information about the Science Matters Book Club, contact Victoria Welborn at (831) 459-2816 or <a href="mailto:welborn@cats.ucsc.edu">welborn@cats.ucsc.edu</a>.

Prepare your garden now for the glory days of spring and summer by planting perennials that will establish themselves over coming months and be ready to really take off as the air and soil warm up. To capitalize on this benefit of our mild climate, visit the UC Santa Cruz annual Fall Plant Sale on Friday and Saturday, September 15 and 16. Hours are noon to 6 p.m. on Friday and 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Saturday. The sale will take place in the Barn Theater parking lot at the intersection of Bay and High Streets at the base of campus.<br>
<br>
This year's selection will also feature an impressive array of organic vegetable six-packs, including salad mix, lettuce, peas, chard, broccoli, leeks, kale, bunch onions, and culinary herbs. For perennial lovers, there will be roses in gallon containers, lavender, and subtropical salvias. Herbaceous perennials like yarrow and delphinium will be available, as will a smattering of California natives, including blue- and yellow-eyed grass, and native currants. All plants are organically grown at the UC Santa Cruz Farm & Garden.<br>
<br>
Fall offers an unbeatable opportunity to prepare your garden because warm soil, mild weather, and relatively long days give perennials a chance to become established, said Orin Martin, manager of the Alan Chadwick Garden at UCSC. Vegetables like lettuce will produce three or four times longer than those that mature during the summer, noted Martin.<br>
<br>
Sponsored by the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems, the sale will benefit the UCSC Apprenticeship in Ecological Horticulture. Members of the Friends of the UCSC Farm & Garden receive a 10 percent discount on purchases; memberships will be available at the sale. For more information about the Fall Plant Sale or the Friends of the Farm & Garden, call (831) 459-3240.<br>

        <title>UCSC's growth part of a statewide trend</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  UCSC's growth mirrors what's happening at campuses statewide, as the UC, California State University, and Community College systems gear up to serve an unprecedented number of new students in the state. At the UC system alone, it is estimated that space will be needed for 63,000 additional academically eligible students by the year 2010.<br>
  <br>
  As one of the state's public campuses, UC Santa Cruz is preparing to do its part to provide for those students. Enrollment at UCSC last fall was 11,300, and the campus's Long-Range Development Plan, adopted in 1988, projects growth to 15,000 students by the year 2005.<br>
  <br>
  As UCSC considers how it might accommodate its share of UC's additional 63,000 students, one scenario under discussion would have UCSC grow by an additional 1,900 students--to 16,900--by the year 2010.<br>

        <title>NSF funds economist's study of electronic markets</title>

<p>
  If electronic commerce hasn't changed the way you do business yet, it's probably just a matter of time. You may still buy your groceries at the local market and prefer to browse the aisles of your favorite bookstore, but whether it's car shopping, day trading, or job hunting, the range of products and services available over the World Wide Web is growing so quickly that you're likely to soon join the ranks of cyberspace consumers.
</p>The explosion of economic activity on the Internet hasn't gone unnoticed by academics, among them UCSC economics professor Dan Friedman, who has launched a $450,000 three-year project funded by the National Science Foundation to help identify what works--and what doesn't work--in the world of cyberspace markets.<br>
<br>
Despite headline-grabbing stories of boom-and-bust cycles in the world of Internet commerce, the trend is clear: In the next ten to 20 years, a large fraction of all transactions will take place electronically. This dramatic change has given Friedman and his colleagues an opportunity to study market dynamics in cyberspace to see how economic theories apply in this new environment and to develop applicable theories more fully. By assessing the effectiveness of different cyberspace markets, economists will be prepared to use their knowledge to help shape the design of future markets.<br>
<br>
"The changes we're seeing in electronic commerce today are comparable to the changes that took place before World War I when the first wave of globalization took place," said Friedman. "With the widespread introduction of telephones and electrical power, and then cars and airplanes, the world changed dramatically. That's happening again today with these new markets, but this time academics have a larger role to play in shaping the changes."<br>
<br>
Successful Internet markets that provide familiar consumer services include Amazon.com and eBay, but the larger part of electronic commerce will involve "business-to-business" transactions. And as cyberspace markets take hold, the way goods and services are created will change, said Friedman.<br>
<br>
Whether business is conducted electronically or traditionally, the "fundamental problem of commerce remains, which is how to bring together buyers and sellers at mutually beneficial prices," said Friedman. In some areas, like car buying, Internet commerce has revolutionized pricing strategies, streamlined the transaction process, and empowered consumers, said Friedman.<br>
<br>
Traditionally, car buyers had to deal with a salesperson, whose job it was to extract the best price from the buyer. Negotiations took place between an amateur buyer and a professional seller. Now that's all changed, said Friedman.<br>
<br>
"Now, buyers go to the web, get the dealer invoice, go into their local dealership and offer to pay a bit over invoice," he said. "The new markets are changing the way business is done. Potentially, both buyer and seller will gain."<br>
<br>
The web holds similar potential to transform labor-market dynamics, with sites like Monster.com offering a range of career services that help job seekers and prospective employers find each other.<br>
<br>
Such dramatic changes were difficult to imagine 20 years ago, said Friedman, who will explore cyberspace markets with Bernardo Huberman, a research scientist who runs the computational dynamics group at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center.<br>
<br>
Different market formats have evolved to match buyers and sellers, ranging from random search and haggling to posted price and auctions, said Friedman. The efficiency of different market formats depends on the nature of the goods or services being exchanged and the conditions of the environment. "New electronic technologies change the environment and create openings for new and more efficient market formats," he said.<br>
<br>
In his research, Friedman will integrate four different approaches: laboratory experiments, field data, computer simulations, and theoretical models. "We believe this integrated series of theoretical and empirical studies will generate the fundamental knowledge that will be invaluable to anyone constructing and maintaining cyberspace markets in the future," he said.<br>
<br>
Electronic markets can also create new problems. Although day trading has "democratized" stock market investing by allowing individuals to easily play the market, the results so far have not always furthered the real purpose of financial markets, which is to allocate investment in companies based on the value of their activities, said Friedman.<br>
<br>
"Your average day trader doesn't know anything about the companies he trades," said Friedman. "Random trades in an effort to show a quick profit are wasteful to society. In the long run, it is not much more profitable to the trader than Las Vegas, so maybe the problem will take care of itself."<br>
<br>
The most dramatic example of a negative impact of electronic trading goes back to the October 1987 stock market panic, which was triggered by the widespread use of an automated electronic trading strategy called "portfolio insurance" that was designed to protect stock market investors from significant losses. Individually, such a tool posed little threat, but its widespread use caused the most serious stock market crisis since 1929, said Friedman.<br>
<br>
Ultimately, Friedman would like the results of this research to be made accessible not only to other academics and the people designing new markets but also to the policymakers who will be shaping regulations regarding electronic commerce.<br>

  For the fifth consecutive year, campus leaders will gather this week for the chancellor's annual fall <a href="http://bas.ucsc.edu/events/index.cfm?fuseaction=home&ConfID=100">conference</a>, a daylong meeting that provides an opportunity for collective, in-depth discussion of issues that are important to the campus. This year's focus will be the future of graduate education at UC Santa Cruz. Participants attend at the invitation of the chancellor. Approximately 150 campus representatives were expected to attend. "Graduate education is the academic foundry of the world-class leaders, scholars, researchers, and thinkers who will effect change in the new millennium," said Greenwood. Following an overview presented by Greenwood, Debra Stewart, president of the Council of Graduate Schools, will give the keynote address, providing a national perspective on trends and issues in graduate education. Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor John Simpson will discuss the 1998 Millennium Committee's charge to the campus regarding graduate education, which directed the university to "serve the public by providing high-quality advanced training, intellectual development, and research methodology for a wide variety of careers." Richard Attiyeh, vice chancellor of research and dean of graduate studies at UC San Diego, will present an overview of University of California graduate education programs, and Frank Talamantes, vice provost and dean of graduate studies at UCSC, will talk about future directions for UCSC graduate studies. The formal remarks will be followed by a roundtable discussion among the speakers, faculty, and students. Focus groups will convene for a working lunch to discuss topics that include funding graduate education; recruitment and retention of graduate students; faculty mentoring; communication between graduate students and faculty; diversity of graduate students, staff, and faculty; distance learning and graduate education; prospects for a graduate college and interdisciplinary programs; and other aspects of the graduate student experience. Focus groups will present their key points and make recommendations during the plenary session, which will be followed by additional general discussion and summary comments by Greenwood, Simpson, Stewart, Attiyeh, and Talamantes. A summary of the proceedings will be posted on the conference web site shortly after the gathering. Last year's conference explored the challenge of ensuring student success in the context of accelerated campus growth and change. The discussion "enriched our collective understanding of the student experience and challenges in academic life and generated insights that enhanced academic programs and support systems," said Greenwood.

<p>
  The desire for ever larger telescopes has driven astronomers relentlessly for nearly 400 years. In 1610, Galileo discovered the moons of Jupiter using a telescope with a lens not much more than an inch in diameter. Today, the largest optical telescopes are the twin Keck Telescopes in Hawaii, with 10-meter mirrors that gather the faint light from distant galaxies. But, of course, astronomers still want bigger telescopes, knowing they can yield new insights into the nature and origins of the universe.
</p>The next milestone in telescope size is likely to be one with a primary mirror 30 meters in diameter, which would provide ten times the light-gathering area of each of the Kecks. UC and the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) have teamed up to design and build a 30-meter telescope, dubbed the California Extremely Large Telescope (CELT). The project is still in the early planning stages, but researchers led by UCSC astronomers are making steady progress on the conceptual design for CELT.<br>
<br>
Project leaders hope to build the massive telescope within the next ten to 15 years, said Joseph Miller, director of UC Observatories/Lick Observatory (UCO/Lick). Miller estimated the total cost of the project would be around $500 million, but it's not clear yet where that money would come from. UCO/Lick and Caltech are funding the current design studies.<br>
<br>
"The scientific potential for a 30-meter telescope is so great that I'm confident we can obtain the necessary funding to build it once we have a detailed proposal," Miller said.<br>
<br>
CELT would have a broad range of applications, according to Jerry Nelson, professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC. It would enable astronomers to probe deeply into nearby star-forming regions to study the births of stars and possibly even to directly image planets around nearby stars. At the other extreme, astronomers could use CELT to study the most distant galaxies, looking far back in time to understand how galaxies and stars formed early in the history of the universe. "And you name it everywhere in between," Nelson said.<br>
<br>
The task for researchers now is to come up with a solid design and a credible cost estimate, said Nelson, who chairs a CELT working group focusing on telescope design issues. There are six working groups made up of UC and Caltech scientists focusing on different aspects of the project. Miller cochairs the project steering committee with Caltech's Chuck Steidel. Most of the design work to date has taken place at UCSC, where UCO/Lick is headquartered.<br>
<br>
CELT will use much of the same technology that has proven so successful in the Keck Telescopes, said Terry Mast, a research physicist at UCO/Lick. Like the Kecks, for example, CELT will have a segmented primary mirror made up of many small, hexagonal mirrors arranged in a honeycomb pattern. (This mirror design, a revolutionary innovation for the Kecks, was Nelson's brainchild.) Instead of the 36 segments in each of the Keck mirrors, CELT's mirror will have 1,080 segments.<br>
<br>
But CELT will not be simply a scaled-up version of the Kecks. That would be far too expensive, according to Mast.<br>
<br>
"The major challenge is cost," Mast said. "We don't have to invent new technology, because we think much of the same technology used for the Kecks will work for CELT. But if you just scale up in a naive way you will end up spending a lot of money. We have to come up with a design that is practical and cost-effective."<br>
<br>
Cost and practicality figured into the decision to design CELT with a 30-meter mirror, rather than, say, a 50-meter or 100-meter mirror. The European Southern Observatory, based in Germany, is pursuing a plan to build a 100-meter telescope called the OWL (for "Overwhelmingly Large") telescope. Based on the historical relationship between telescope size and cost, however, Nelson figured that a 30-meter telescope could be built for 5 percent of the cost of a 100-meter telescope.<br>
<br>
"It would be foolish not to build a 30-meter telescope first," he said.<br>
<br>
With the segmented-mirror design, there is no fundamental limit to telescope size. It's just that as the telescope gets bigger it becomes more difficult and more expensive to build.<br>
<br>
"The sky's the limit, but my logic has been that if you take steps that are too large you run the risk of making mistakes and using money ineffectively," Nelson said. "Going from 10 meters to 30 meters is an attractive step size, and a 30-meter telescope is going to be fabulous scientifically."<br>
<br>
Although astronomers have a good idea of what CELT's capabilities will be, many of its most exciting applications probably won't be discovered until after it has been built, said Michael Bolte, a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC.<br>
<br>
"Who knows what we're going to discover? Previous experience with major advances in telescopes suggests that many of the most exciting new discoveries will be in unanticipated areas," Bolte said.<br>
<br>
Clearly, however, one of the major applications will be to explore the most distant galaxies. The Hubble Deep Field, a revolutionary image of deep space obtained by the Hubble Space Telescope, revealed a wealth of very faint objects. Observations with the Keck Telescopes showed some of them to be extremely distant galaxies, but a more powerful telescope is needed to study them in detail. UC and Caltech astronomers have used the Keck Telescopes to study about 10 percent of the objects in the Hubble Deep Field, but the rest are too faint to probe with the Kecks. With CELT, astronomers will be able to study the faintest smudges of light in the Hubble Deep Field, some of which may show the earliest stages of galaxy formation in the universe.<br>
<br>
"We will be able to see the evolution of galaxies from when they were born, more than 10 billion years ago, right up to today," Bolte said.<br>
<br>
A critical component of CELT will be an adaptive optics system to correct for the blurring effects of the atmosphere. "That's probably the hardest part, because adaptive optics has a long way to go," said Nelson, who directs the Center for Adaptive Optics based at UCSC.<br>
<br>
Adaptive optics (AO) relies on extremely rapid and precise measurements of atmospheric distortion coupled with equally rapid and precise compensation by the telescope. This compensation is achieved with a deformable mirror (separate from the primary mirror) that changes shape to correct the distortion of the image. As the telescope gets larger, the requirements for an AO system become increasingly demanding. For example, the deformable mirror for the Keck AO system has about 250 actuators--tiny pistons that control the mirror's shape--whereas the CELT deformable mirror will need about 5,000 actuators. Existing AO technology will not be adequate for CELT, Nelson said.<br>
<br>
"There are a lot of issues with adaptive optics and a lot of ideas for how to resolve them. As long as there is sufficient funding for adaptive optics research, the technology will be here when CELT is ready for it," he said.<br>
<br>
Other issues researchers are grappling with during the design phase include the fabrication process for the primary mirror segments; how to contain the cost of the 6,000 sensors and 3,000 actuators needed to keep the mirror segments aligned; and how to design the telescope to withstand the wind forces typical of mountaintop observatories.<br>
<br>
Making the mirror segments will be one of the most costly parts of the project, according to Mast. Although the mirror is symmetrical overall, the individual segments are not, making the polishing of their optical surfaces extremely challenging. "It will require a very close collaboration with the manufacturer to ensure that they can deliver what we need," Mast said.<br>
<br>
Interestingly, the computers and electronics needed to control the huge telescope are not a major concern. "The technology we think of as in the forefront, such as electronics, will be easier and less expensive than the older technology, such as polishing mirrors. That's still part art and part science, and it is still very expensive," Mast said.<br>
<br>
Project leaders have not yet determined where CELT will be built. According to Nelson, the possibilities include Mauna Kea, where the Keck Telescopes are located, and several sites in Chile.<br>

        <title>New Business Architecture will support campus growth</title>

<p>
  Tangible manifestations of campus growth are apparent across the UCSC campus: student enrollment rising, buildings under construction, new colleges opening their doors.<br>
  <br>
</p>Behind the scenes, the campus is preparing to support that growth with a new business model, dubbed "UC 2010--A New Business Architecture."<br>
<br>
"With the New Business Architecture, we're making sure that the administrative infrastructure keeps pace with the growth of UCSC and all the campuses as well as with new technologies," said Tom Vani, vice chancellor of Business and Administrative Services.<br>
<br>
"The idea is that as we continue to grow and make changes to technology, we use this tool to make life as simple as possible," he added.<br>
<br>
Vani is part of the New Business Architecture Planning Group, a group of vice chancellors and other top administrators from throughout the UC system that presented a report to the UC Regents in July.<br>
<br>
The New Business Architecture is expected to enable the university to manage growth, control costs, improve the work environment, and implement best business practices, according to the report.<br>
<br>
The group consulted a number of UC's corporate partners, including PricewaterhouseCoopers, Cisco Systems, IBM, and Gateway Computers, for help in designing key elements of the plan.<br>
<br>
The New Business Architecture makes six recommendations for UC:
<ul>
  <li>Develop "business portals"--personalized web sites that will help individuals carry out their jobs and access training
  </li>
  <li>Apply new approaches to recruitment, retention, and development of employees
  </li>
  <li>Streamline the university's policies and processes
  </li>
  <li>Leverage new technology to contain costs and improve services
  </li>
  <li>Integrate campus financial systems and provide enhanced financial reporting
  </li>
  <li>Embed performance management systems in UC business processes and focus on the most important financial controls
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The plan is expected to be carried out over the next decade, with completion scheduled for 2010. Creation of a UC-wide steering committee will be one of the first steps.<br>
  <br>
  One of the most important features of the New Business Architecture is the attention it pays to recruiting, retaining, and developing UC staff, said Vani.<br>
  <br>
  The report outlines new approaches to recruitment and retention which include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Developing and promoting UC as an employer of choice
  </li>
  <li>Making the application and recruitment process more user-friendly
  </li>
  <li>Expanding diversity efforts
  </li>
  <li>Exploring flexible benefits programs, including a retirement plan that would benefit staff with less than five years service
  </li>
  <li>Changing job classification systems and defining jobs more broadly
  </li>
  <li>Improving and assessing UC's compensation packages
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The report proposes that UC provide opportunities for staff to build leadership skills and enjoy career mobility. In addition, the report recommends that UC hire additional staff when needed to help the campus grow, and that it should improve its relationships with employee unions.<br>
  <br>
  To further sustain and develop the university's workforce, the report recommends that campuses invest deeply in employee training and development. Part of this training and development could be provided by the business portal--another essential part of the New Business Architecture plan.<br>
  <br>
  The business portal--essentially a web page customized to particular campuses, jobs, and people--can provide initial and continual training to the staff member who uses it, Vani said. It will also provide links to data warehouses and web pages that will help staff perform their jobs more efficiently.<br>
  <br>
  Parts of the business portal model will be standardized across the UC system, but much of it will be customized to particular users.<br>
  <br>
  For example, staff who purchase goods and services for their units may have links to suppliers they use most often. They'll be able to research the best prices and have access to standard purchasing contracts. Policies, procedures, and financial reports will also be available online.<br>
  <br>
  Eventually, Vani foresees staff having the ability to complete time sheets at their business portal. Expense reports may also be online.<br>
  <br>
  "This is more than a web page. It is the tool for you to be able to do your job and navigate through the business of our university," Vani said.<br>
  <br>
  The sweeping changes proposed under the New Business Architecture will affect every unit on campus, with the least impact to grounds, facilities, and crafts, Vani said. Academic and centralized units, such as Business and Administrative Services (BAS) will be the most affected.<br>
  <br>
  In addition to Vani, other UCSC people who assisted with the report were Kirk Lew, assistant vice chancellor for financial affairs, and Catherine Faris, Business and Administrative Services' former assistant vice chancellor.<br>

        <title>Management and Leadership Conference planned at UC San Diego</title>

        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  The fifth annual UC Management and Leadership (UCML) Conference is scheduled for Sunday, December 10, through Tuesday, December 12, at the historic Hotel Del Coronado in beautiful San Diego. The conference theme is "The Future Legacy: Today's Decision-Makers Build Tomorrow's University."<br>
  <br>
  UC San Diego and the Office of the President invite academic leaders, managers, business officers, campus administrators, health science administrators, principal investigators, department chairs, and other UC professionals to come share ideas and learn new skills with hundreds of other decision-makers from the UC community.<br>
  <br>
  "This conference focuses on the future legacy, and our combined role in shaping the university of tomorrow," said Steven W. Relyea, UCSD vice chancellor for business affairs.
</p>

<p>
  "We have created a program that offers a mix of keynotes, panel discussions, and break-out workshops, not to mention plenty of time for informal idea swapping with your colleagues from around the state."<br>
  <br>
  A total of six plenary sessions will provide attendees the opportunity to hear leading experts address topics and issues of importance to all at UC. In order to maximize learning opportunities for participants, 36 workshops are planned in addition to plenary sessions so attendees can select topics of personal interest. Additionally, two in-depth preconference seminars, one focusing on knowledge transfer and the other on mediation skills, also are scheduled for Sunday, December 10.<br>
  <br>
  "The topics and discussions planned for UCML San Diego reflect the number of pressing issues we all currently face in our daily work," said Mark Cunningham, UCML San Diego conference chair. "However, when planning the conference, we also kept our eye on the future, knowing that the decisions we make today will have a profound impact on the future of our departments, our campuses, and UC overall."<br>
  <br>
  Keynote sessions will address topics ranging from "The Challenges of Student Growth and Student Diversity," presented by Senator Steve Peace, to "Thinking in the Future Tense," presented by author and columnist Jennifer James.
</p>

<p>
  Workshops fall under six general topics and address everything from "Managing the New Worker," to "Writing for the Web," to "Knowledge Management," to "Faculty Start-Up Companies: The Challenges, the Successes."<br>
  <br>
  Registration is by online form only, and is available at the UCML San Diego <a href="http://www.ucmlsandiego.ucsd.edu">web site</a>. The web site also features comprehensive conference information, including descriptions of all plenary and workshop sessions, presenter bios, and accommodations and travel information.<br>
  <br>
  The conference registration fee, including meals, is $395 per person until November 10; afterward, the fee increases to $450. The UCML hotel rate at the Hotel Del Coronado is $159 per night; please note that after November 17, this special room rate is no longer guaranteed. Preconference seminars are $55 and include lunch.<br>
  <br>
  Visit the UCML San Diego web site for further information or to contact conference planners.<br>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  The release of a three-disc boxed set of works by songwriter and mathematician <b>Tom Lehrer</b> has provoked extensive coverage--all of it glowing--in the mediarecently. Articles have appeared in Bay Area papers such as the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> and the <i>Oakland Tribune.</i> A story also appeared recently in the <i>New York Times,</i> featuring a four-color shot of Lehrer at the piano in his Santa Cruz home, and stating, "Tom Lehrer finds the enduring appeal of his songs 'amazing.' Maybe he needs to listen to a new three-CD set of his work."
</p>

<p>
  The appointment of theater arts professor <b>Kathy Foley</b> to the Chandra Bhandari Endowed Chair in India Studies was reported recently in <i>India West.</i>
</p>

<p>
  It isn't easy helping your friends make an independent movie, according to music production supervisor <b>Sven Davis</b>. Davis detailed his experience in a <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2000/07/16/SC38836.DTL">feature story</a> that appeared last month in the <i>San Francisco Examiner-Chronicle.</i> After delivering a seven-foot-long latex shark to the L.A. set, Davis was willing to help out wherever he could. But, unfortunately, volunteers--viewing their work on the set as a possible career advancement--regarded Davis as a threat to their own industrious appearance. Davis was useful for a moment, when they needed him and the director's mother to stand in as extras. "I can now say," Davis summarized, "that I excel at doing nothing on both sides of the camera."

In 1985, Kang joined the department of electrical and computer engineering at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. As department head, he has directed one of the premier programs in the country.<br>
<br>
Kang succeeds Patrick Mantey, who will continue as dean until Kang's arrival in January. In announcing the appointment, Chancellor Greenwood praised Mantey's excellent leadership during the past three years as inaugural dean of the School of Engineering.<br>
<br>
"The Baskin School of Engineering is poised to grow significantly over the next several years, and I am convinced that Dr. Kang will provide the necessary leadership and vision to guide this growth in a manner that builds on the accomplishments of Dean Mantey and ensures the continuing development of an engineering school of distinction," Greenwood said.<br>
<br>
Looking forward to his new role at UCSC, Kang noted the importance of maintaining existing strengths while expanding the engineering programs.<br>
<br>
"I am challenged and most excited for the great opportunity to work with faculty and staff to make UC Santa Cruz engineering programs of highest quality and at the same time expansive," Kang said.<br>
<br>
At Urbana-Champaign, Kang is affiliated not only with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, which he heads, but also with the Department of Computer Science, the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology, and the Coordinated Science Laboratory in the College of Engineering.<br>
<br>
Kang's research interests include computer chip design (specifically, methods of very large-scale integration, or VLSI) and optimization of chip design for performance, reliability, and manufacturability; modeling and simulation of semiconductor devices and circuits; high-speed optoelectronic circuits; and fully optical network systems. He holds six patents, has published more than 300 technical papers, and has coauthored eight books.<br>
<br>
Kang is a fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). He is a foreign member of the National Academy of Engineering of Korea and the recipient of numerous national and international awards and honors, including the Semiconductor Research Corporation Technical Excellence Award in 1999.
<p>
  Kang was a visiting professor at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology at Lausanne in 1989 and visiting Humboldt Professor at the University of Karlsruhe in 1997 and at the Technical University of Munich in 1998. He has served as a member of the Board of Governors, secretary and treasurer, administrative vice president, and 1991 president of the IEEE Circuits and Systems Society. He was the founding editor in chief of the <i>IEEE Transactions on VLSI Systems</i> and has served on the editorial boards of several other journals.<br>
  <br>
  Kang's appointment as dean of the School of Engineering is for a five-year term beginning January 1, 2001, pending final approval by the UC Regents.<br>
  <br>
  The Baskin School of Engineering, established in 1997, is UCSC's first professional school, offering bachelor's degrees in computer engineering, computer science, electrical engineering, and information systems management.
</p>
<p>
  The school also offers master's and doctoral degrees in computer engineering and computer science and plans to offer advanced degrees in electrical engineering within the next two years. Over the next decade, the School of Engineering expects to double the size of its faculty and establish two new departments: Applied Mathematics and Statistics and Biomolecular Engineering.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  UC Santa Cruz received $24.3 million in private support during the fiscal year that ended June 30, according to the campus's Development Office. The support includes $6 million from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. The fiscal year 1999-2000 marked the fourth consecutive year the campus has received record-breaking levels of private gift support. "The sustained increase in private philanthropic support is testimony to the continued excellence of UCSC's programs in the arts, engineering, humanities, and natural and social sciences," said Chancellor Greenwood. "In particular, recognition from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, in the form of two investigator appointments, lifts the campus to an entirely new level in regard to biomedical and engineering research." David Haussler, professor of computer science and director of the Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering, was selected as a full investigator for the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI), and Yishi Jin, assistant professor of biology, was selected as an assistant investigator. The two are among 48 scientists selected nationwide for the prestigious appointments. With the addition of the HHMI awards, this year's fundraising total at UCSC was 31 percent more than that received the previous year, when nearly $18.5 million was contributed to campus programs, scholarships, and fellowships. In addition to major gifts, UC Santa Cruz receives gifts from many individual donors who provide significant support to the campus annually. Campus supporters gave $1.4 million through UCSC's Annual Giving program this past year, with $1.1 million coming through the Telephone Outreach Program. These donors are primarily alumni and parents, with matching funds from corporations. Trustees of the UC Santa Cruz Foundation, which supports UCSC through its private fundraising efforts, gave over $930,000 to the campus this past year. Ronald P. Suduiko, vice chancellor for University Relations, credited a number of sources for the fundraising achievements this past year. "Our success is due to the generosity and personal support of donors who include many alumni, parents, and friends of the university; the excellence of the university as exemplified by the work of our faculty, staff, and students; and the commitment of our University Relations team," he said. The bulk of the funding this past year came from the following sources: foundations, 32 percent; individuals, 26 percent; and the business sector, 11 percent. Other sources included institutions and community and campus organizations, totaling 31 percent. Major private gifts or grants received by UCSC during the past year included:

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_2555" align="alignright" width="153"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/08/weed_alex.00-08-28.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2555" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/08/weed_alex.00-08-28.jpg" alt="Alex Weed Photo courtesy of Alex Weed" width="153" height="223" /></a>Alex Weed Photo courtesy of Alex Weed[/caption]
<p>
  <b>Fellow student snags runner-up title--and $15k</b>
</p>
<p>
  Last spring, sophomore Alex Weed was in a typical end-of-quarter frenzy--preparing for a final in film class, rehearsing daily until midnight for a Chautauqua play--when he found out about a national film competition that offered a $40,000 prize and good exposure for the winner.
</p>Fueled by optimism and caffeine, Weed decided he could handle one more major project with a looming deadline. Weed stayed up for two days straight--scripting, shooting, and editing his film, for which he also composed and recorded a score.<br>
<br>
The insanity paid off: Weed's film, <i>Perfect Accident,</i> landed him the grand prize in <a href="http://www.icast.com">iCAST</a>'s "Show us your Shorts" contest. Weed's longtime friend and fellow UCSC student Kenny Meehan, who told Weed about the contest and helped him film <i>Perfect Accident,</i> also entered the contest and came in as a runner up, winning $15,000 for his film, <i>Incognito Superhero.</i><br>
<br>
"I did all the filming in a day and edited through the night. Then I ate breakfast and continued to edit until I passed out," Weed recalled. He woke himself up and continued editing until 3 p.m. that day when he rushed the finished copy to the post office (he needed to send it by overnight mail to meet the contest deadline). "It was the most fun, stressful, insane 48 hours of my life," he said.<br>
<br>
Weed filmed his three-minute piece on his Hi8 camera and edited it on a friend's computer, using the Avid film-editing program.<br>
<br>
This is not Weed's first film, which may partially explain why he was able to put it together so quickly (that and his superhuman powers). Weed has been involved in filmmaking for years, and works frequently with Meehan, with whom he grew up in Menlo Park.
<p>
  "My friends and I have been making little movies since seventh grade. We call ourselves Purgatory Production," he said. "I have a billion movie ideas. This contest was great because it gave me a focus for an idea."<br>
  <br>
  <i>Perfect Accident</i> is a story about a lovelorn man who decides to commit suicide. As he perches on a balcony, memories of failed romances flash through his mind--women lobbing painfully familiar quips: "You're smothering me," "You're intellectually inferior," "I could say I just want to be friends, but I don't even want that," "I always faked it," and, even a guy, who tells the hero, "You made me realize I'm not gay." When the character jumps he falls into an interesting situation that leads to an odd but happy ending.<br>
  <br>
  Punctuated by playful camera angles and clever close-ups, the piece also features an expressive score, which Weed composed and then played on a synthesizer. Weed says it was a challenge to synchronize the score with his footage, which required playing the music over and over again to get the timing right. Weed had another challenge on the sound track--trying to find a perfect sound to accompany the character's plummet. In an inspired (or perhaps desperate) moment, he discovered that whistling into the computer microphone, which also made a wind sound, worked perfectly.<br>
  <br>
  The film gives Weed exceptional exposure through iCAST--an online entertainment company. The panel of judges who chose the winning films included director Michael Lehmann (<i>Heathers, Hudson Hawk, Airheads, The Truth About Cats and Dogs</i>); filmmaker Mitchell Robbins (<i>Squeeze, Next Stop Wonderland</i>); director/producer/writer Cauleen Smith (<i>Drylongso, Daily Rains, Chronicles of a Lying Spirit</i>); music video director Nigel Dick (who works with the Backstreet Boys, Ricky Martin, and Britney Spears); and actress Sara Gilbert (<i>Roseanne, Poison Ivy, The Big Tease,</i> and <i>High Fidelity</i>).<br>
  <br>
  Weed intends to donate a portion of his prize money to the <a href="http://www.riekes.org/">Reikes Center</a>, a nonprofit educational center for kids based in Menlo Park. "I wouldn't be anywhere without Reikes Center," he said.
</p>
<p>
  "It's an amazing place, with athletic facilities and recording and editing studios. Kids can come in with an idea and they'll help them fulfill their goals. When we went in the eighth grade, they hooked us up with an editing suite and we've been making movies ever since."<br>
  <br>
  Weed is taking this academic year off and plans to return to UCSC the following year to pursue a degree in film and digital media. He had thought he might have to spend a good portion of the year working but, thanks to the prize money, he can travel instead. Among the places he plans to travel to is Australia; and, the way Weed willingly takes on new challenges, maybe he'll go for Olympic gold while he's there.

<p>
  UCSC is widely recognized as a major center for research on lead and other toxic elements in the environment, and the campus has now launched a new Department of Environmental Toxicology that will address a broad range of issues concerning potentially harmful chemicals and microbes in the environment.
</p>The department's faculty study the environmental fates and biological effects of toxic substances in both aquatic and terrestrial environments. Their work is helping to pinpoint the sources of contaminants such as lead and mercury in the environment and is shedding light on how those and other toxicants, as well as certain pathogenic microbes, cause disease. Ultimately, the results of their research may lead to new methods for controlling environmental hazards and for counteracting the health effects of pollutants.<br>
<br>
"We want to identify the sources of toxicity in the environment and understand how they become a threat to organisms, including humans," said Professor A. Russell Flegal, who chairs the new department.<br>
<br>
The department offers graduate programs leading to M.S. and Ph.D. degrees and undergraduate courses in environmental toxicology. With a growing range of interdisciplinary research programs, the department builds on UCSC's recognized strengths in environmental research. It also fills a distinctive niche among toxicology programs, most of which are associated with medical schools and focus primarily on human health, Flegal said.<br>
<br>
In the past, graduate students working with Flegal and UCSC's other environmental toxicologists have received degrees in fields such as biology, marine sciences, or chemistry. Now they will all be in the same department, and that's an exciting development, said graduate student Allison Luengen.<br>
<br>
"It brings together people who have been in different departments and provides a focal point for our work in environmental toxicology," said Luengen, who is completing her M.S. in marine sciences and will enter the Ph.D. program in environmental toxicology this fall.<br>
<br>
Several of UCSC's environmental toxicologists have earned international reputations based on their work with trace elements in the environment. These include toxic heavy metals such as lead and mercury, as well as biologically essential elements, such as copper and manganese, that can be toxic at high concentrations.<br>
<br>
Flegal and his colleages have documented heavy metal contamination in San Francisco Bay, the Great Lakes, Antarctica, Europe, and the deep waters of the North Atlantic. Their analyses have identified lead hazards in crystal decanters, plumbing fixtures, and calcium supplements, resulting in changes in how those products are made. The researchers have also helped establish standard procedures for measuring lead exposure in children and other vulnerable populations.<br>
<br>
Members of the new department play a key role in developing new environmental policies and regulatory actions through collaborations with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the California State Water Resources Control Board, and the California Attorney General's Office. For example, new EPA protocols for monitoring heavy metals in aquatic systems are based on methodologies developed at UCSC.<br>
<br>
One of the factors that sets the campus apart from other institutions in this area of research is the availability of state-of-the-art analytical facilities for studying trace elements. Whether the concern is lead in a blood sample or nutrients in ocean water, performing accurate and precise measurements is often a major challenge. Highly sensitive instruments and specially designed clean labs at UCSC enable researchers to perform extremely sophisticated analyses.<br>
<br>
"We have been leaders in establishing the use of isotopic tracers to identify the sources of lead contamination, and we can do that because of the facilities we have," said Donald Smith, an associate professor of environmental toxicology.<br>
<br>
Smith is currently involved in several research projects addressing the health effects of lead and manganese. For example, he is collaborating with researchers in the Harvard School of Public Health and with Mexican public health authorities to assess the effects of environmental lead on pregnant women and their children in Mexico City. Smith has also been investigating the potential health effects of manganese because of its proposed use as a gasoline additive.<br>
<br>
UCSC's environmental toxicology program is casting a wide net in its approach to environmental perils, investigating harmful microbes as well as chemical toxicants. Assistant Professor Karen Ottemann is studying how bacterial pathogens detect and respond to their host environments. Because harmful microorganisms are posing an increasing threat to public health, expertise in this field is a critical component of the new department, Flegal said.<br>
<br>
Flegal hopes to further round out the department with new faculty. "We are recruiting experts in organic toxins and other areas, and we look forward to accepting a group of exceptional students with diverse interests and backgrounds into the graduate programs," Flegal said.<br>

        <title>Energy drought calls for new conservation measures</title>

<p>
  Most of us are familiar with conserving water. But there's a new kind of drought in California, calling for a new method of conservation.
</p>A drought of electricity has hit the western states, and it's expected to last through 2001, said Bob Dunn, campus energy manager at Physical Plant.<br>
<br>
"There's a shortage of capacity on peak days," said Dunn. "The power plants just can't make enough energy to meet demand."<br>
<br>
Several factors contribute to the energy shortage. The state's strong economic growth and the deregulation of the power industry both play a role. In addition, few power plants have been built in the past decade. Many are now planned, but the lengthy approval and construction process means that most will not be operating before 2002.<br>
<br>
The shortage of capacity is felt most often during the summer months, when people turn on air conditioners to ward off the heat.<br>
<br>
Several heat waves this summer have pushed demand for power to emergency levels. In June, the <a href="http://www.caiso.com">California Independent System Operator</a> (CAISO), which manages the state's electric grid, ordered rotating block outages in portions of the Bay Area because of extreme heat conditions and limited resources.<br>
<br>
Similar curtailment has occurred in southern California more recently--and more often.<br>
<br>
The block outages are necessary in order to maintain electric service to customers that provide essential public safety services, such as hospitals and fire stations, according to <a href="http://www.pge.com/all.html">Pacific Gas and Electric Company</a>.<br>
<br>
In general, the System Operator has asked that all Californians work harder to conserve energy.<br>
<br>
UCSC is taking a number of measures to voluntarily reduce its energy consumption, said Dunn. Physical Plant staff are experimenting with raising the thermostats on air conditioning units for the science buildings. The group is also developing additional strategies for energy savings, including a formal curtailment policy.<br>
<br>
"We already try to run as lean as we can," said Dunn, "and it's hard to squeeze any more out."<br>
<br>
In the meantime, faculty and staff can do a number of things to help reduce the campus's energy consumption. The following are energy conservation tips from Pacific Gas and Electric:
<ul>
  <li>Turn off PCs, monitors, printers, copiers, and lights every night, every weekend, and when they're not in use. If you can't turn off the whole computer, turn off the monitor and the printer.
  </li>
  <li>Clean dusty diffusers and lamps every 6-12 months for improved light output.
  </li>
  <li>Close shades or blinds during early morning and late evening to reduce solar insulation heat gain.
  </li>
  <li>Set thermostats at 78 degrees Fahrenheit for air conditioning and 68 degrees Fahrenheit for heating.
  </li>
  <li>When possible, use laptop computers--they consume 90 percent less energy than standard desktop computers.
  </li>
  <li>When possible, use ink-jet printers--they consume 90 percent less energy than laser printers.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  In addition, said Dunn, faculty and staff can help by:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>switching off unnecessary lighting in their offices
  </li>
  <li>turning off any personal electronic devices, such as coffee pots or hot plates, when they're not in use.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  These conservation measures may seem small, but collectively they can make a difference, said Dunn.<br>
  <br>
  "Any reduction in our use of electricity will help the situation," he said.<br>
  <br>
  The campus is the largest employer--and the largest energy user--in Santa Cruz County. The campus draws 6.5 megawatts during peak times, an amount equal to 0.4 percent of the power produced by the Moss Landing Power Plant.<br>
  <br>
  For its new construction, the campus has exceeded the state standard for energy conservation. It's also the lowest energy user of all nine UC campuses, but Santa Cruz's mild climate certainly plays a role in that distinction, said Dunn.<br>
  <br>
  If UCSC's power pipeline is cut during an electricity emergency, the campus's cogeneration plant--which produces half the power used by the campus--will continue to supply electricity to the natural sciences buildings where it is needed for laboratory experiments and for reasons of public safety, said Dunn. Administrative buildings, housing, and other academic buildings must rely on emergency generators.

        <title>CATS sets limits on e-mail message sizes, server storage</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 28 Aug 2000 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>

        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  Communications and Technology Services (CATS) is imposing limits on incoming message sizes and server storage for users of "@cats.ucsc.edu" e-mail addresses.
</p>

<p>
  The limits are necessary, according to a letter from CATS, due to an increasing load on the "cats-po-1" server that holds mail for users with "cats" e-mail addresses. CATS plans a hardware upgrade in fall quarter 2000, which is expected to address the problem at that time.
</p>

<p>
  Effective August 31, CATS will enforce these limits:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>A 5 MB limit on incoming message sizes destined for cats e-mail addresses. This size limit would not affect e-mail destined for departmental e-mail servers (for example, @biology.ucsc.edu or @cse.ucsc.edu) nor would it affect outgoing mail.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>A 7 MB limit on server storage of read messages for active mail readers. This is for mail stored on the server. This limit will not affect users who download all their mail to their desktop systems or to their timeshare accounts via "pine."
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  For more information, please see an <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/cats/sc/help/news/2000/00.08.18.email.shtml">article</a>, "CATS introduces operational limits on e-mail," on the CATS web site.<br>
  <br>
  Faculty, staff, and students with questions or problems may contact CATS through the Information Resource Center at 459-HELP, Monday-Friday, from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., excluding the lunch hour (noon-1 p.m.) and holidays. You can also send e-mail to <a href="mailto:infocat@cats.ucsc.edu">infocat@cats.ucsc.edu</a>.

<p>
  <font color="#993300"><b>Note:</b></font> Due to fires in other areas requiring California Department of Forestry response, UCSC's controlled burn has been <font color="#993300"><b>CANCELED</b></font> for Tuesday, August 29. The burn has been tentatively rescheduled for Wednesday, September 6.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
  UC Santa Cruz firefighters, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection
</p>(CDF), and other local crews are scheduled to burn approximately 55 acres in three meadows off Empire Grade road on Tuesday, August 29.
<p>
  The burn was originally scheduled to take place August 16, then was rescheduled for August 23. Both of the earlier burns were canceled due to adverse weather conditions.
</p>
<p>
  Most of the controlled burn is scheduled to take place in the Twin Gates area four miles up the road from the campus's main entrance, encompassing selected parts of Marshall Field on the east and west sides of the road. Another small meadow southeast of the main area will also be burned.
</p>
<p>
  The burn is scheduled to start in midmorning and last until late afternoon. It may be canceled if fires in other areas of the state require attention, or if weather conditions move outside a prescribed safety window.
</p>
<p>
  The campus carries out controlled fires in the Marshall Field area for several reasons, said Maggie Fusari, director of the UCSC Campus Natural Reserve. The fires help maintain the biodiversity of native plants in the area and provide open habitat for some plants and animals that require it.
</p>
<p>
  "We try to preserve high-quality habitat for those native species--like the popcorn flower or Ohlone Tiger Beetle--that require a relatively open habitat," said Fusari. "If annual grasses grow in and create a big, heavy thatch, that can be detrimental to other species."
</p>
<p>
  In addition to the benefits to plant and animal life, controlled burns help the campus lessen its risk from wildland fires by eliminating fuel that would feed such a fire, said UCSC Fire Chief Chuck Hernandez. They also provide training for firefighters.
</p>
<p>
  Firefighters from UCSC, the Scotts Valley Fire Department, and the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CDF) are expected to participate in the controlled burn. Approximately a dozen youths from the California Youth Authority's conservation camp in Ben Lomond are also expected to take part.
</p>
<p>
  All of the designated burn area is on campus property. The west side of Marshall Field is part of the UCSC Natural Reserve.
</p>
<p>
  For more information, call the UCSC Fire Department at (831) 459-3473.

<p>
  UCSC's financially needy students will have a perpetual source of help, thanks to the generosity of donors to UCSC's Alumni Association.
</p>In June, the <a href="http://alumni.ucsc.edu">Alumni Association</a> met its goal of assembling a $1 million endowment for its Alumni Association Scholarship Fund (AASF). The endowment will ensure that the Alumni Association will always be able to support financially needy UCSC undergraduates, easing the burden of their college expenses and helping the campus attract and retain students who otherwise might be dissuaded from getting a college degree.
<p>
  In 2000-01,the fund will award $2,500 scholarships to a dozen financially needy students. Nearly 70 students have received a total of $146,000 in scholarships since the fund began nearly a decade ago.
</p>
<p>
  Alumni and friends of the campus celebrated the $1 million endowment at the annual Alumni Vintners Wine Tasting late last month. A special dinner at University House for past and present members of the Alumni Council capped the event.

        <title>Treasurer of the UC Regents resigns</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 14 Aug 2000 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  UC Office of the President <b><br></b>Patricia A. Small announced her resignation in mid-August as treasurer of the Regents of the University of California. Small explained that, after five years as the Regents' chief investment officer and after nearly 29 years of service at the University of California, she now wishes to explore different challenges and opportunities in the evolving new economy. However, at the request of the Regents, she has agreed to continue her current duties until a new treasurer is named, but until no later than Dec. 31, 2000. Regents Investment Committee Chair Judith L. Hopkinson stated: "Patricia Small has ably served the University of California for three decades. Most recently, as treasurer, she has helped the Regents guide the university's investment funds to their current strong position. Building on this achievement, our recently adopted comprehensive asset allocation plan will guide our investment program going forward." Regents Chairman S. Sue Johnson, speaking on behalf of her fellow Regents, assured university employees of a smooth transition.
</p>

<p>
  "Patricia Small has contributed in the last five years to a remarkable long-term record of performance for the university's investments," she said. "As we move forward, we do so from a position of strength that will help ensure the continued safety and success of these funds under a new treasurer."<br>
  <br>
  Small added: "I am proud of what I have helped to accomplish over these last 29 years, including as treasurer of the Board of Regents. During this period, the university's assets have grown from less than $1 billion to $58 billion. In the last five years, assets have increased by $25 billion, and we have established a strong record of safety and performance for the university's investments. I leave with confidence that the Regents and the Treasurer's Office will continue to ensure that the pension funds and the benefits the university provides its employees, along with the university's endowment, will enjoy a strong, secure future."

        <title>Fire crews schedule practice drill at Merrill College</title>

        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  Fire agencies from across Santa Cruz County will converge on Merrill College later this month for a countywide fire drill.
</p>

<p>
  Firefighters will use smoke machines on August 26 at Merrill's B Dorm, filling several floors up with smoke. As many as nine fire engines and two ladder trucks are expected to respond during the practice, which is scheduled to take place from 8:30 a.m. to noon.
</p>

<p>
  "It's a real-life type of scenario in an area that typically has pretty poor access for fire crews," said UCSC Fire Captain Don Brookes. "It's fantastic that this will be happening, because these are the people we'll be relying on in the event of an actual fire situation."
</p>

<p>
  Brookes expects fire crews to learn a number of lessons from the practice session, including how to work in a building with multiple stories and in an area with limited access and limited staging space.
</p>

<p>
  Members of the public are asked to stay clear of the area during the drill. Firefighters will use theatrical smoke during the practice, which is odorless and nontoxic.
</p>

<p>
  The practice session is hosted by the City of Santa Cruz Fire Department in cooperation with UCSC.
</p>

  The first presentation of a traveling physics demonstration developed by physicists at the Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics with local high school teachers attracted local and national media attention. The event at Aptos High School, which included 4-foot bolts of electricity striking an instructor in a special metal outfit, was covered by KSBW (Channel 8) and the <i>Watsonville Register-Pajaronian,</i> and also led to a story on ABCNews.com (see "<a href="http://more.abcnews.go.com/sections/science/DyeHard/dyehard000803.html">Zapping Teachers for Science</a>"). Physics professor <b>Hartmut Sadrozinski</b> and physics lab manager <b>Charles Crummer</b> were featured in the coverage along with local teachers.
</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_2540" align="alignright" width="200"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/08/lee_barbara.00-08-14.200.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2540" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/08/lee_barbara.00-08-14.200.jpg" alt="Barbara Cool Lee's manuscript, "In Deep Water," won in a national writing competition sponsored by the Romance Writers of America." width="200" height="296" /></a>Barbara Cool Lee's manuscript, "In Deep Water," won in a national writing competition sponsored by the Romance Writers of America.[/caption]
<p>
  In May, Barbara Cool Lee was happily overwhelmed when she learned that a group of staff and faculty members had pooled together enough funds to make it possible for her to attend the national conference of the <a href="http://www.rwanational.com">Romance Writers of America</a>, a conference that included a writing competition in which Lee was a finalist.
</p>Lee took time off from her job in the Kresge Faculty Services Center in late July to attend the conference. And it's a good thing she did, since she was declared the winner of the competition in the "Romantic Suspense/Gothic" category for unpublished authors.
<p>
  "I am so glad I went," said Lee, who was not quite sure how she was going to manage the trip before the surprise gift came her way. "I would have regretted not going for so many reasons. Everyone else who was nominated went, even one woman--a published author--who lives in New Zealand."
</p>
<p>
  One advantage of attending the conference, Lee said, was that as a finalist in the competition she had better access to editors and instant credibility. "I was walking around all week with a sign on me, basically, because my name tag identified me as a finalist."
</p>
<p>
  Before she left the conference, Lee and an editor had made the first steps toward publication--an agreement to work on revisions that are likely to lead to publication. Lee is waiting now for the revision letter from the publishing house (which Lee is keeping confidential for now); the letter is one of the final steps in the publication process before a contract is signed.
</p>
<p>
  Lee wrote her manuscript, "In Deep Water," during her lunch hours, working at her laptop in the passenger seat of her '92 Toyota pickup. She has written two manuscripts this way, and is working on a third. Excited as she is, Lee is keeping her feet on the ground. She can't quit her day job anytime soon.
</p>
<p>
  "This is not the kind of thing where you become an overnight success," she explains.
</p>
<p>
  So, for a few more years anyway, passersby will continue to see Lee at lunch time, working busily in her other office--the one where hearts break and mend and mysteries unfold.

<p>
  <font color="#993300"><b>Note:</b></font> Due to adverse weather conditions, UCSC's controlled burn has been CANCELED. The burn has been tentatively rescheduled for Wednesday, August 23.
</p>
<hr>
<h4>
  Controlled burn reduces fire hazard, encourages native plant biodiversity
</h4>
<p>
  UC Santa Cruz firefighters, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection
</p>(CDF), and other local crews are scheduled to burn approximately 55 acres in three meadows off Empire Grade road on Wednesday, August 16.
<p>
  Most of the controlled burn is scheduled to take place in the Twin Gates area four miles up the road from the campus's main entrance, encompassing selected parts of Marshall Field on the east and west sides of the road. Another small meadow southeast of the main area will also be burned.
</p>
<p>
  The burn is scheduled to start in midmorning and last until late afternoon. It may be canceled if fires in other areas of the state require attention, or if weather conditions move outside a prescribed safety window.
</p>
<p>
  The campus carries out controlled fires in the Marshall Field area for several reasons, said Maggie Fusari, director of the UCSC Campus Natural Reserve. The fires help maintain the biodiversity of native plants in the area and provide open habitat for some plants and animals that require it.
</p>
<p>
  "We try to preserve high-quality habitat for those native species--like the popcorn flower or Ohlone Tiger Beetle--that require a relatively open habitat," said Fusari. "If annual grasses grow in and create a big, heavy thatch, that can be detrimental to other species."
</p>
<p>
  In addition to the benefits to plant and animal life, controlled burns help the campus lessen its risk from wildland fires by eliminating fuel that would feed such a fire, said UCSC Fire Chief Chuck Hernandez. They also provide training for firefighters.
</p>
<p>
  More than 20 firefighters from UCSC, the Scotts Valley Fire Department, the Central Fire Protection District for Santa Cruz County, and the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (CDF) are expected to participate in the controlled burn. Approximately a dozen youths from the California Youth Authority's conservation camp in Ben Lomond are also expected to take part.
</p>
<p>
  All of the designated burn area is on campus property. The west side of Marshall Field is part of the UCSC Natural Reserve.
</p>
<p>
  For more information, call the UCSC Fire Department at (831) 459-3473.

[caption id="attachment_2535" align="alignright" width="200"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/08/break.group.00-08-14.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2535" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/08/break.group.00-08-14.jpg" alt="About 75 members of the Santa Cruz and UCSC communities attended a breakfast meeting in August." width="200" height="136" /></a>About 75 members of the Santa Cruz and UCSC communities attended a breakfast meeting in August.[/caption]
<p>
  Dozens of Santa Cruz County community leaders turned out for a recent breakfast meeting during which Chancellor Greenwood and other campus representatives detailed UCSC's achievements and outlined plans for the future.
</p><br>
Among the representatives of education and government who attended the gathering were Santa Cruz Mayor Keith Sugar and several members of the city council, County Superintendent of Schools Diane Siri, and Sheriff Mark Tracy. Representing the business community were Santa Cruz Area Chamber of Commerce Executive Director Michael Schmidt and Santa Cruz Business Council members Charles Canfield and Norman Lezin. The event, which was the first of its kind, drew about 75 invited guests.<br>
<br>
The audience heard a two-part message that focused on the benefits the campus brings to the community and on the ways in which UCSC will grow in the next ten years.<br>
<br>
"I can't think of anything more worth doing than helping the young people of this state get the education they need to become the leaders of our community and our nation," Greenwood said at the conclusion of the gathering.<br>
<br>
The university remains the county's largest employer, with approximately 5,000 people on the payroll, including student workers. In 1998-99, the campus generated $328 million in annual expenditures that multiply to boost the county's economy by nearly $750 million. By comparison, agriculture generates $250 million for the county. UCSC is a more "efficient" economic engine, confining its activities to one-fourth of its 2,000-acre site, compared to the 35,000 acres devoted to agriculture, noted Greenwood.<br>
<br>
But the campus's contributions to the community add up in noneconomic terms, too, said Greenwood. Based on the results of a recent survey of UCSC faculty, staff, and students, in which 80 percent of respondents said they volunteer in the community on a regular basis, Greenwood estimated that UCSC contributes about one million hours per year in volunteer service to the community.
<p>
  "That's the equivalent of 429 full-time positions and approximately $11.8 million in salaries, if each individual received the county-average salary of $27,000 a year," she said.<br>
  <br>
  That message of community participation was followed by Greenwood's request for greater understanding and support of the campus as it grows to meet the specifications outlined in the 1988 Long-Range Development Plan, which calls for an enrollment of 15,000 students within the next ten years. In addition, the campus has been asked by the Office of the President to consider ways to accommodate another 1,900 students as its share of "Tidal Wave II," the euphemism for more than 63,000 new UC students that are expected to flood the system by 2010.<br>
  <br>
  Greenwood said top administrators are pursuing several strategies to accommodate greater enrollment while minimizing the impact on the Santa Cruz campus. These innovations include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Enrolling more students in off-campus residential learning programs, such as the Education Abroad Program and UC's systemwide UCDC Program, which gives undergraduates an opportunity to study and work in Washington, D.C.
  </li>
  <li>Offering classes at the new UC Santa Cruz Silicon Valley Center
  </li>
  <li>Increasing distance-learning and summer course offerings
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  More students could aggravate an already tight housing market, but UCSC is pursuing ambitious plans to provide beds for 10,000 students by the 2005-06 academic year. Greenwood noted that only UCSC and UC San Diego house more than 25 percent of their students on campus. UCSC currently provides space for about 50 percent of its students and is aiming to accommodate 70 percent, she said.<br>
  <br>
  Adding to the housing challenge is the anticipated hire of 600 new faculty in the next ten years, 300 of whom will replace retiring faculty and 300 of whom will reflect expanding academic programs, said Greenwood.<br>
  <br>
  "We are building student housing as rapidly as we can, and faculty and staff housing is also a high priority," said Greenwood. "To reach our aggressive housing goals, we are going to need some community support."<br>
  <br>
  Greenwood acknowledged that there has been friction between the campus and some members of the community over university-related traffic, and she emphasized that, popular myth notwithstanding, a recent traffic impact study showed that UCSC is not a major contributor to traffic snarls on Highway 1 and on Mission Street east of Bay Street. The university's greatest traffic impacts are on Western Drive, High Street east of Bay Street, and Bay south of High, she noted. The success of the campus's growing alternative transportation network is underscored by the fact that more than 50 percent of all trips to and from the campus are by some means other than a single-occupant vehicle.<br>
  <br>
  A question-and-answer period followed presentations about academic programs by John Simpson, campus provost and executive vice chancellor; Gary Griggs, professor of Earth sciences and director of UCSC's Institute of Marine Sciences; Manuel Pastor, professor of Latin American and Latino studies and director of UCSC's new Center for Justice, Tolerance, and Community; and Jerry Nelson, professor of astronomy and astrophysics and director of the Center for Adaptive Optics. J. Michael Thompson, associate vice chancellor for outreach, admissions, and student academic services, presented an overview of UCSC's educational outreach programs.<br>
  <br>
  Thompson's presentation received praise from Diane Siri, county superintendent of schools, who said UCSC's outreach programs are having a positive impact on students, whose test scores are up and more of whom are graduating prepared to attend college.<br>
  <br>
  "Every child can and should be aiming toward a post-high school education," said Greenwood, adding that 48 percent of UCSC students receive "significant" financial aid, and 60 percent receive some assistance.<br>
  <br>
  Also at the gathering, Greenwood accepted the Centennial Medallion from Michael Scheele, representing the American Society of Landscape Architects. The award honored the campus as one of the most beautiful sites in the country, reflected by its outstanding integration of development and the natural environment.
</p>
<p>
  Renowned landscape architect Thomas Church, who served on the campus's early planning committee, wrote in a letter nominating the campus for the honor, that at UCSC, "the buildings are less important than the visual composition and the trees." In accepting the award, Greenwood said that the same commitment to stewardship of this unique campus will continue as the campus grows.<br>

        <title>New student Regent nominee thrives on education and community service</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  UC Office of the President
</p>

<p>
  Tracy M. Davis, a Ph.D. student at UCLA whose passion is education and who thrives on community service, has been nominated as the next student member of the University of California's Board of Regents.<br>
  <br>
  Davis' nomination, recommended by the Regents' Special Committee to Select a Student Regent, will be considered by the full board at its September meeting. If approved, Davis will become student Regent-designate and be able to participate in all deliberations but not vote until July 2001, when her one-year term as student Regent begins. The current student Regent is another UCLA graduate student, Justin Fong.<br>
  <br>
  Davis, 27, who is pursuing a doctorate in higher education and organizational change, was on the fast track toward a production job in television when a chance presentation to a group of "at risk" students changed the direction of her life.<br>
  <br>
  "Educators help shape lives," she wrote in her application to become student Regent. "With education playing such an important role in the futures and livelihood of America's youth, I commit myself to stretching the limits of my potential as an educator and lifelong learner and enabling students to do the same."<br>
  <br>
  Davis, raised in Seal Beach, Calif., received her undergraduate degree in anthropology from UCLA. She received the Chancellor's Service Award at graduation. Before deciding to change her career path, she had worked as a researcher and coordinator for Cable News Network in Washington, D.C., and New York.<br>
  <br>
  Her current volunteer activities are linked to UCLA's Alumni Association and Graduate Student Association.<br>
  <br>
  In a paid position as coordinator of student programs at UCLA's undergraduate admissions, she supervises a staff of 40 students and a volunteer staff of 150 students. Since 1997, Davis has worked as an outreach and admissions officer on campus. She especially values her opportunity to work directly with students.<br>
  <br>
  At UCLA's Marine Aquatic Center, she serves as a sea kayaking instructor and outdoor adventure guide.<br>
  <br>
  If approved, Davis will be the 27th student Regent since the position was established in 1975.<br>
  <br>
  "This will be an exciting time to be a Regent in California," said Davis. "With the electronic generation at hand and the changing needs of our state, the next five to 10 years will be a crucial time for the UC system and education in general."

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_2530" align="alignright" width="180"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/07/talamantes.00-07-31.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2530" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/07/talamantes.00-07-31.jpg" alt="Frank Talamantes Photo: Titangos Photography Studio" width="180" height="251" /></a>Frank Talamantes Photo: Titangos Photography Studio[/caption]
<p>
  Biologist Frank Talamantes was appointed last week to the position of vice provost and dean of graduate studies. Talamantes, a professor of molecular, cellular, and developmental biology, will begin a three-year term in the position on August 1.
</p><br>
In announcing the appointment, Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor John Simpson noted the extensive experience Talamantes brings to the position, not only as a faculty member at UC Santa Cruz, but also through his service to the scientific community and his long-standing commitment to issues of minority and graduate education.<br>
<br>
"The chancellor and I are delighted to have Dr. Talamantes join the senior academic administrative group," Simpson said. "At this time in its history, UC Santa Cruz is uniquely poised to build graduate programs of distinction. As the campus moves forward to meet the challenges and responsibilities of the new century, we believe that this appointment provides an excellent opportunity for the campus."<br>
<br>
A member of the UCSC faculty since 1974, Talamantes is a prominent endocrinologist and has received numerous awards and honors for his scientific achievements. He currently chairs a study section at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) responsible for the review of training grants for graduate students and postdoctoral fellows. Talamantes is also a past president of the Society for the Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS), and his leadership on issues of minority education has earned him several awards.<br>
<br>
As a researcher, Talamantes has done pioneering work on reproductive hormones and the growth hormone receptor. His current projects include studying the role of reproductive hormones in breast cancer susceptibility. The NIH and the National Science Foundation have funded his research continuously since 1974. Talamantes is the author of 162 manuscripts and 13 book chapters, and serves as the U.S. editor for the <i>Journal of Endocrinology.</i><br>
<br>
In addition to the research he has conducted in his own laboratory, Talamantes has contributed to the work of other investigators around the world by generating and distributing valuable reagents used to study specific hormones and hormone receptors.<br>
<br>
Talamantes was named a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1989. Other honors in recognition of his scientific contributions include the "Transatlantic Medal Lecturer" award from the British Society for Endocrinology in 1991; the Society for the Study of Reproduction Research Award in 1993; and the Endocrine Society's Sidney H. Ingbar Distinguished Service Award for 2000. He was recently invited to present the Solomon A. Berson Distinguished Lecture at the American Physiological Society meeting in 2001.<br>
<br>
In addition to serving as president of SACNAS, Talamantes has been actively involved in NIH programs associated with the advancement of ethnic minority students in the sciences. In 1989, he received an award from the American Association for Higher Education for Outstanding Leadership and Contributions to Education in the Hispanic Community. In 1998, he was selected as one of the "100 Most Influential Hispanics" by <i>Hispanic Business Magazine.</i><br>
<br>
Talamantes has served as major professor to 23 graduate students and as an adviser to 22 postdoctoral fellows. He has also directed the independent research of 60 undergraduate students, many of them ethnic minority students who have gone on to earn Ph.D. or M.D. degrees at other institutions.<br>
<br>
Talamantes received his B.A. in biology from the University of St. Thomas in Houston and his M.A. in biology from Sam Houston State University in Huntsville, Texas. He received his Ph.D. in endocrinology from UC Berkeley. Talamantes joined the UCSC faculty in 1974 and rose to the rank of full professor in 1984.

        <title>New dean of humanities named at UC Santa Cruz</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 31 Jul 2000 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_2524" align="alignright" width="144"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/07/godzich.00-07-31.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2524" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/07/godzich.00-07-31.jpg" alt="Wlad Godzich" width="144" height="216" /></a>Wlad Godzich[/caption]
<p>
  An internationally respected professor of English and literature has been appointed dean of the UC Santa Cruz Humanities Division.
</p><br>
Named to the position is Wlad Godzich, who comes to UCSC from the University of Geneva in Switzerland, where he was professor of English and comparative literature, chair of the Emergent Literatures program, and a professor in the university's Graduate Institute of European Studies. His appointment as dean at UCSC is effective as of August 7.<br>
<br>
Godzich succeeds Jorge Hankamer, a professor of linguistics, who had served as dean since 1995.<br>
<br>
The author of several critically acclaimed books on literature and language, Godzich has held visiting professorships at universities around the world, from Brazil to South Africa to Canada to Spain. His experience in academic administration goes back to 1961 and includes the positions of director of the Columbia University-Barnard College program in Paris; and, at the University of Minnesota, director of the Office of Research Development, director of the comparative literature program, director of the Center for Humanistic Studies, and coordinator of UM's international program in Dakar, Senegal. He also served as director of the Department of English while at the University of Geneva. He has organized more than a dozen international conferences during his career.<br>
<br>
Godzich is a member of the editorial boards of several journals and has authored a number of books, including <i>The Culture of Literacy</i> (Harvard University Press, 1994) and a new book, "Leituras de Walter Benjamin," which is forthcoming. He is editor of the book series Theory and History of Literature, published by the University of Minnesota Press and the Manchester University Press.<br>
<br>
In discussing his new appointment, Godzich said, "Everywhere around the world very serious questions are being raised about the future of the humanities and the nature of the humanities. I think this is something that practicing humanists must address directly at the administrative level as well as the intellectual level. Those of us in the field must dedicate ourselves to renewal and renovation of humanities. I think it is fitting that a new attempt at reinventing humanities be attempted at UCSC, which has been considered a pioneering school since its inception."<br>
<br>
With the rush of technological advancement in such areas as genetic engineering, communications, and medicine, society is facing a quagmire of ethical and philosophical concerns. Godzich explains that the humanities will play a vital role in not only addressing, but identifying, these issues.
<p>
  "We need to impress on all of contemporary society that the notion of the human must be in the forefront of our concerns," Godzich said. "But this notion of the human is not one we can continue to derive from traditional sources of humanism--we are entering an age where human beings will be manufacturing human beings and we need to think very hard about who we are and who we want ourselves to be. The role of the humanities in this new age is to provide answers and, also, find the questions to address the future of humanity, our identity, our ethics, the use of new technologies, and the role of culture and diversity in new societies."<br>
  <br>
  Godzich says that one goal for his administration at UCSC will be to foster collaborative efforts. "I think that much of research that has been done in the humanities has been carried out in an individualistic mode, and one of the things I hope to promote at UCSC is a new way of conducting research in a genuinely collaborative way--a way in which undergraduate and graduate students and junior and senior faculty will form research teams. Rather than break down the humanities by discipline, I'd like to foster an approach to the humanities as a series of issues we examine together."<br>
  <br>
  Godzich was one of a handful of candidates selected by UCSC's Humanities Dean Search Committee to be put forth for consideration by Academic Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor John B. Simpson.
</p>
<p>
  Stevenson College provost and professor of history Tyler Stovall was a member of that committee. According to Stovall, who also chairs the History Department, "Godzich stood out because he had a wealth of administrative experience and he also had wonderful experience as a scholar. He came across as a very brilliant and vibrant intellectual force. We felt he had some strong ideas about reaching out to the broader community--both academic and nonacademic--about the importance of the humanities."<br>
  <br>
  Stovall also noted that, "As someone coming from outside the University of California system, Professor Godzich seemed to have a good command of the procedures of the system. The sense we had was that he would be able to bring in fresh perspective but also an understanding of how procedures work here. We were impressed by the fact that he had very strong and definite ideas but was also very willing to listen. On top of his administrative contributions, we felt he'd be a wonderful addition to the faculty here."

<p>
  Grammy Award-winning singer/songwriter Tracy Chapman has made her August 30 concert at the San Jose Center for the Performing Arts a benefit for organic farming research and education.
</p>
<p>
  Chapman has donated a block of tickets to the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems at UC Santa Cruz and to the Organic Farming Research Foundation (OFRF). Proceeds from the sale of this limited supply of premium tickets will benefit both organizations. Two benefit ticket packages will be available.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Supporters at the $75 level will receive a benefit package that includes a premium seat at the concert and a poster.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Supporters at the $125 level or above will receive a benefit package that includes a premium seat at the concert, a poster, a special preconcert organic buffet dinner by renowned Bay Area chef Jesse Cool of Flea Street Cafe, and a T-shirt.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  To reserve a benefit package, or for more information, please call Laura Ridenour at OFRF at (831) 426-6606. All donations are tax-deductible above the value of the items received.<br>
  <br>
  Chapman's support of sustainable agriculture was apparent with the 1995 release of her widely praised album, <i>New Beginning.</i> The album notes featured photographs of the artist in the fields at the UCSC Farm, and seeds were distributed at her concerts to encourage people to get their hands in the soil. As she tours the country following the release of her latest album, <i>Telling Stories,</i> Chapman has made her San Jose performance an opportunity to provide financial support to the work of the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Sustems and OFRF.<br>
  <br>
  The center's proceeds will support scholarships in the Apprenticeship in Ecological Horticulture at UC Santa Cruz. The apprenticeship is a six-month residential program that offers rigorous hands-on training in organic farming and gardening. Nearly 1,000 graduates of the program are working on farms and in rural and urban agricultural programs across the U.S. and around the world.<br>
  <br>
  Since 1990, OFRF has fostered the improvement and widespread adoption of organic farming practices. The foundation supports growers in the field by funding farm-based research into organic systems while fighting for strong organic standards and greater public investment in organic research. To learn more about the UCSC apprenticeship or OFRF, visit their web sites at <a href="http://zzyx.ucsc.edu/casfs/appr.html">zzyx.ucsc.edu/casfs/appr.html</a> and <a href="http://www.ofrf.org/">www.ofrf.org/</a>.<br>
  <br>
  The benefit dinner is made possible, in part, by support from Earthbound Farm.

        <title>UCSC names NASA Ames Research Park as preferred site for Silicon Valley Center</title>
        <pubDate>Wed, 19 Jul 2000 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>2528</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  In a report given today to the UC Regents, Chancellor Greenwood announced that planning for UCSC's Silicon Valley Center will focus on the proposed NASA Ames Research Park as the preferred site for a permanent location. Further planning studies will lead to a final proposal to the Regents.
</p><br>
Among the criteria for siting the center are visibility, accessibility, opportunity, net cost, and alignment with the teaching, research, and service mission of UCSC. A number of sites throughout Silicon Valley were evaluated and, after in-depth study, the NASA site was advanced for further consideration.
<p>
  Ames Research Center is one of ten field centers of NASA. The proposed site is part of a collaborative R&D campus currently being developed by NASA Ames that includes a range of research, education and museum activities. UCSC's Silicon Valley Center would be included on a parcel within the NASA Research Park, which is located adjacent to the existing campus of the NASA Ames Research Center in Moffett Field.
</p>

<p>
  "NASA's proposed R&D park fulfills the location criteria for our Silicon Valley Center," Greenwood said. "NASA's innovative vision for a research complex that emphasizes synergy among participants is compatible with our campus's goals. Because of our existing research collaborations with NASA Ames and numerous other educational partnerships between UCSC and Silicon Valley institutions, we already have a strong foundation on which we can develop further academic programs of benefit to the region. Additionally, the opportunity for housing students and faculty, plus direct access by light rail and two freeways, makes the location very appealing."
</p>

<p>
  NASA Ames Director Henry McDonald commented, "We are delighted that UCSC has designated the NASA Research Park as the preferred site for their new Silicon Valley Center. We believe this is a very positive move, and we are excited that UCSC is taking steps toward being our partner in the creation of a unique, world-class educational and R&D campus."
</p>

<p>
  The center is expected to serve as a portal to the UC system, connecting all of the campuses to Silicon Valley, especially in the areas of research. The University of California and NASA share many research areas of interest and strengths, such as biotechnology, nanotechnology, planetary sciences, and astrobiology. In addition, research is expected to be conducted on issues of social justice, education, labor, and economics, among other topics.
</p>

<p>
  It is expected that UCSC will offer classes for both undergraduates and graduates at the Silicon Valley Center. The specific curricular offerings and subjects of research are to be determined through planning by faculty, which now is under way and will continue parallel to site planning.
</p>

<p>
  UCSC currently provides extensive services in Silicon Valley through UCSC Extension, which enrolls more than 50,000 students in Silicon Valley courses for professional development and lifelong learning. In addition, UCSC is engaged in teacher training and retention programs, including services performed by the Silicon Valley New Teacher Center in collaboration with Joint Venture Silicon Valley.
</p>

<p>
  Other UCSC activities supporting education in Silicon Valley include curriculum development and work with underrepresented students in partnership with the East Side Union High School District and San Jose Unified School District. The campus is engaged in collaborations with San Jose State University in areas including teacher preparation and engineering, and with all of the area's community colleges to streamline the transfer process and to increase the number of students that transfer from community colleges to the University of California.
</p>

<p>
  The UC Office of the President provided seed funding to advance planning for the center during the 1999-2000 fiscal year. The 2000-01 state budget includes $1.1 million for UC to continue the planning process. As planning proceeds, the UC Regents will consider a formal proposal for the Silicon Valley Center in spring 2001. Groundbreaking would occur shortly thereafter, with the first students enrolling at the center in fall 2003.

        <title>English Language Institute attracts Egyptian educators to Santa Cruz</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 17 Jul 2000 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  UCSC Extension
</p>

<p>
  UCSC Extension's English Language Institute has welcomed to Santa Cruz a group of 25 Egyptian educators in a 20-day global training program focused on the methodology and curriculum development of English for Specific Purposes.
</p>

<p>
  The program, which started July 3, will continue until July 28 at UCSC Extension's University Town Center location in downtown Santa Cruz.
</p>

<p>
  The general goal of the English for Specific Purposes (ESP) program--focusing on English for academic purposes--is to produce a cadre of skilled and knowledgeable ESP teachers and trainers. These people will implement training approaches and teaching methodologies for other teachers and trainers and develop educational programs and curriculum tailored to Egyptian educational institutions.
</p>

<p>
  Participating in the ESP training workshop are English teachers from universities and institutes throughout Egypt who will be completing a three-part program. The program includes a one week pre-departure workshop in Cairo, a four-week training in Santa Cruz implemented by UCSC Extension, and a two-week follow-up training with ESP teachers in Cairo.<br>
  <br>
  "This is a very exciting and rewarding program for us to be working with a group of individuals who not only are determined to gain a good foundation of what is good teaching but decide what approaches are best adapted and sustained in their particular learning and cultural environment," said Susan Miller, director of the English Language Institute.<br>
  <br>
  UCSC Extension has a long tradition of offering top quality continuing education programs with over 3,000 courses annually and 55,000 enrollments. It is the premier provider of professional development programs with six classroom centers in Silicon Valley and the Central Coast.
</p>

<p>
  UCSC Extension's International Programs include language and cultural enhancement as well as specialized contract training programs for groups from around the world. The University Town Center, where the ESP Course Design and Materials Development for ESP Trainers Program is held, offers fully equipped state-of the-art classrooms, a computer laboratory with Internet access, and administrative offices.
</p>

<p>
  The English for Specific Purposes program is funded by USAID and administered through the Institute of International Education, AMIDEAST and the Career Development Center in Cairo.<br>
  <br>

  <font color="#003399">Ease Japan's credit crunch and economic growth will follow</font>
</h3>
<p>
  <b>By Michael Hutchison</b><br>
  <br>
  Since the early 1990s, rising unemployment, price deflation, sluggish growth, and recession have beleaguered Japan.<br>
  <br>
</p>The country's central bank has responded by lowering interest rates to stimulate demand. Short-term rates were gradually lowered from 8.3 percent in early 1991 to virtually zero by early 1999 and have stood at that level for more than a year.<br>
<br>
With interest rates at historic lows, why is the Japanese economy still in a slump? One explanation, put forward by economist Paul Krugman, is that traditional monetary policy instruments are powerless to provide effective stimulus to the economy because Japan is in a "liquidity trap." A liquidity trap is characterized by a situation--similar to that in Japan today--where interest rates are at or near zero.<br>
<br>
Monetary policy is seemingly impotent to stimulate demand and raise spending since interest rates are already at the lowest point possible. Krugman draws on two bits of empirical evidence to support the liquidity trap argument.<br>
<br>
First, he points to the fact that short-term interest rates have reached a minimum point, virtually zero.<br>
<br>
Second, Krugman points out that injections of liquidity by the central bank have not been very effective in raising the growth rate of the broader money aggregates.<br>
<br>
He shows the monetary base grew 25 percent from 1994 to 1997, but that the broader monetary aggregate (M2 + CDs) grew only 11 percent. Bank credit grew not at all.<br>
<br>
More recent statistics indicated "money hoarding" continued to be evident in 1998-99, as an expansion of the monetary base in the range of 8 percent to 10 percent resulted in only about 3 percent growth in M2 + CDs.<br>
<br>
Moreover, low interest rates and expansion in the monetary base had not helped increase aggregate demand--the economy continued in recession.<br>
<br>
The main alternative explanation for the ineffectiveness of monetary policy to stimulate the economy is the "credit crunch" view. This explanation focuses on the contraction of the supply of bank credit (credit crunch) caused by massive nonperforming loans accumulating in the financial system. This argument has two parts.<br>
<br>
The first focuses on the decline in bank capital due to the accumulation of bad loans held by Japanese banks. The capital asset ratio of the 20 largest financial institutions in Japan fell significantly between 1994 and the end of 1998.<br>
<br>
Less-than-candid reporting both by banks and by the ministry of finance about the magnitude of the nonperforming loan problem made it difficult for banks to raise capital in domestic and international financial markets.<br>
<br>
They therefore responded by reducing the amount of loans. Japanese financial institutions have attempted to raise capital-asset ratios, in part in response to recently tightened international capital standards, as well as in response to pressure from the markets and the government.<br>
<br>
But building capital-asset ratios by restraining lending takes a long time. It induces a credit squeeze in the process--the origins of the credit crunch in Japan.<br>
<br>
The second part of the credit crunch explanation focuses on the cautious lending attitude of Japanese banks following their recent experience with bankruptcies, nonperforming loans, and recession.<br>
<br>
Liabilities associated with bankruptcies hit an all-time high of 2.7 trillion yen in October 1997, and a trend line shows a sustained rise to the highest point in the postwar period toward the end of the decade.<br>
<br>
These circumstances make firms less desirable potential borrowers than they used to be, from the banks' point of view. They also have the self-reinforcing effect of tightening credit conditions and worsening the recession.<br>
<br>
Evidence of a credit crunch also is suggested by the Bank of Japan's survey known as tankan. This survey asks companies their views of the "lending attitude of financial institutions." Despite the low interest rate environment, the survey indicates a sharp tightening of credit conditions in Japan since mid-1997 facing both large and small enterprises.<br>
<br>
These lending attitudes, at least from the borrower perspective, have become much more stringent. A credit crunch implies injections of liquidity (base and narrow money expansion) do not increase credit and aggregate lending.<br>
<br>
This is exactly what has occurred in Japan. Base and narrow money have increased at a robust pace in 1997-99, but the broader money aggregates most directly related to spending in the economy grew modestly.<br>
<br>
Most disturbing is that aggregate lending by banks has decreased sharply, the flip side of which is the tightening of credit conditions faced by enterprises in Japan.<br>
<br>
The balance of evidence seems to support the credit crunch explanation. To address the banking and credit crunch problems, public funds totaling 60 trillion yen (12 percent of GDP) finally were set aside in 1998-99 to recapitalize banks.<br>
<br>
In principle, this should ease the credit squeeze and induce banks--particularly with further injections of liquidity into the banking system--to increase lending.<br>
<br>
Long-delayed capital injections and restructuring of the banking system should finally help push Japan's economy into an expansion. The analysis here suggests bank recapitalization should ease the credit crunch, and if the Bank of Japan keeps interest rates low, economic growth will soon follow.<br>

<p>
  The gradual recovery of the sardine population along California's Central Coast is good news, but unanswered questions persist about the causes of the crash in the 1950s and how best to manage the population's resurgence. In an attempt to answer some of those questions and to guide those charged with managing wild fish populations, ecologist Marc Mangel participated on a high-level advisory panel that recently submitted a report to Congress on fishery management.
</p>The report, "Ecosystem-Based Fishery Management: A Report to Congress by the Ecosystems Principles Advisory Panel," includes an assessment of how ecosystem principles are currently applied to fishery management and recommendations for expanding their implementation. It also establishes goals and policies for U.S. fisheries conservation and research.<br>
<br>
The ecosystem approach views fisheries as part of an interconnected community of living things and the physical environment, but many of the complex interactions in marine ecosystems remain poorly understood.<br>
<br>
What is needed, according to Mangel, is an "ecosystem-based" approach to fishery management that would incorporate the indirect effects of human interventions on fisheries and the marine ecosystem.
<p>
  "Fishery management still takes a largely single-species approach, whereas an ecosystem-based approach would look at things such as the impact of the sardine catch on the salmon, marine mammals, and marine birds that eat sardines," he said.<br>
  <br>
  Since 1976, Mangel has witnessed a policy shift in Congress, where the emphasis has moved from maximizing yields to regulating the catch in order to sustain fish populations over time.<br>
  <br>
  "That really changes the focus," said Mangel, who was one of 20 academics, government employees, and fishing industry representatives on the National Marine Fisheries Service Ecosystem Principles Advisory Panel. "What you want to do to sustain a fish stock is very different from what you might do to maximize the catch."<br>
  <br>
  In the Antarctic, where krill fishing took off in the mid-1970s, regulators saw that something needed to be done to protect populations of krill, the small fish that are at the cornerstone of the southern ocean ecosystem. "Everything eats krill, or eats something that eats krill," explained Mangel. "Fish, marine mammals, and marine birds all eat krill. The southern ocean is where the ecosystem approach has been used with the greatest success."<br>
  <br>
  Mangel has been involved in research on krill fisheries since 1986. He has served on numerous U.S. delegations to the scientific Committee for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). In August 1999, he convened the second International Symposium on Krill, which was held at UCSC.<br>
  <br>
  Increasingly, sustainability is being recognized as more important than maximizing some measure of catch, said Mangel. "Scientists are just beginning to be able to analyze and monitor the complicated interactions that occur among species," he said, acknowledging that broad political and public support for research will be critical to securing the funds that are necessary to pay for the complex and time-consuming research.<br>
  <br>
  Mangel hopes the panel's report to Congress will be used by conservationists, lawmakers, regulators, and the commercial fishing industry.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_2506" align="alignright" width="200"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/07/kretschmer_bud.00-07-17.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-2506" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/07/kretschmer_bud.00-07-17.jpg" alt="Ernest T. "Bud" Kretschmer Photo: Shmuel Thaler" width="200" height="172" /></a>Ernest T. "Bud" Kretschmer Photo: Shmuel Thaler[/caption]
<p>
  A new oral history on a prominent member of the Santa Cruz music world has just been released by the <a href="http://library.ucsc.edu/reg-hist/index.html">Regional History Project</a> of the <a href="http://library.ucsc.edu/index.html">University Library</a>.
</p>The volume, titled, <i>Ernest T. Kretschmer: Reflections on Santa Cruz Musical Life, 1993-1999,</i> was composed by Regional History Project Assistant Editor, Irene Reti, who conducted the interviews with Kretschmer and edited the volume.<br>
<br>
This is the project's second publication on Kretschmer, a notable presence in Santa Cruz musical life for more than 30 years. In this volume, Kretschmer reflects on the significant local cultural developments of the last decade and his role in those events. He describes the coming-of-age of the Santa Cruz County Symphony under Maestro Larry Granger, the need of the symphony and other musical organizations for a performing arts concert hall in north county, and recent efforts to establish such a facility.
<p>
  Kretschmer also discusses the Henry J. Mello Center for the Performing Arts, the premiere cultural venue in south Santa Cruz County, which Kretschmer was instrumental in founding.<br>
  <br>
  Kretschmer discusses the world-renowned Cabrillo Music Festival, which he has participated in since its inception. He recalls the festival's acclaimed 1999 production of Leonard Bernstein's "Mass," and the innovative tenure of the festival's Music Director/Conductor, Marin Alsop. He also gives a lively history of Santa Cruz's New Music Works, directed by Phil Collins, which has highlighted the work of local composers, including Lou Harrison.<br>
  <br>
  Kretschmer's philanthropy over the years has included the donation of concert grand pianos to local venues, the establishment of music scholarships for UCSC students, the support of UCSC's resident student ensemble program, and, most recently, the establishment of a permanent endowment to enrich musical archives in the University Library's Special Collections.<br>
  <br>
  Krestchmer's memoir demonstrates the importance of dedicated volunteers in local cultural organizations and how their contributions have created in our small community unusually diverse and thriving performing arts and musical organizations.<br>
  <br>
  Bound, indexed copies of this volume can be ordered from the Regional History Project at (831) 459-2847, or via e-mail to <a href="mailto:ihreti@cats.ucsc.edu">ihreti@cats.ucsc.edu</a>. The volume is also available for viewing at Special Collections, <a href="http://library.ucsc.edu/mchenry/">McHenry Library</a>, and at <a href="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/BANC/">Bancroft Library</a>, UC Berkeley.

        <title>Biology Department reorganization creates two new departments</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 17 Jul 2000 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>2505</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  The Department of Biology has reorganized into two new departments: Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology and Ecology and Evolutionary Biology. Charles L. (Leo) Ortiz, who had been chair of the Biology Department and now chairs the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, said the reorganization will make administration and planning easier for the two new departments. "The impetus behind this had to do with the Biology Department at UCSC becoming very large and biology as a discipline becoming very diverse," Ortiz said. "Administratively, it is much easier to deal with it in two separate departments." Students are not likely to notice any changes in the undergraduate and graduate programs in biology, he said. The undergraduate curriculum and the various biology majors currently offered will continue to be administered jointly by the two departments. (Several new biology majors were established recently [view <a href="../07-03/bs.html">previous Currents article</a>].) The graduate programs of the new departments will also remain much the same, since they already existed as two separate tracks within the old Biology Department. "I suspect that no one will notice much difference," Ortiz said. UCSC is not alone in the move to split the traditional biology department into two or more smaller departments, said Manuel Ares, chair of the new Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology. "This is very common at universities across the country," Ares said. The most significant effect of the change is to make planning for the future much easier, Ares said. He noted that the reorganization does not result in any new staff resources, and that the department staff will continue to work much as they did before, both within the two new departments and together to administer joint programs. "We don't see this as a split, really, but more a division of labor that reinforces the strengths of our programs," Ares said. The research programs of faculty in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology are concentrated in several overlapping areas: population and community ecology; evolutionary biology; physiology and behavior, especially of marine mammals; and systematics and biodiversity.
</p>

<p>
  In the Department of Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology, faculty research interests fall into the general areas of cell biology, developmental genetics, neurobiology, plant molecular biology, RNA molecular biology, and structural biology.<br>
  <br>
  "The stereotype is that the molecular biologists are the lab rats and the other biologists get to work outside and get suntans," Ares said. "But seriously, there are differences in terms of the kinds of resource issues we face and other factors that will affect how we plan for the future."

<p>
  <img align="right" border="0" height="172" src="../art/shakouri.125.jpg" width="125" alt="">The National Academy of Engineering has honored Ali Shakouri, assistant professor of electrical engineering, with selection to participate in the 2000 Frontiers of Engineering Symposium. The three-day meeting brings together outstanding engineers (ages 30 to 45) from industry, academia, and government to discuss pioneering technical work and leading-edge research in various engineering fields and industry sectors. The program provides an opportunity for top-notch engineers early in their careers to learn about cutting-edge developments in fields other than their own, thereby facilitating collaborative work and the transfer of new approaches and techniques across fields. This year's Frontiers of Engineering Symposium will take place September 14-16 in Irvine, California.<br>
  <br>
  The web site for the <a href="http://www.cse.ucsc.edu/research/compbio/sam.html">Sequence Analysis and Modeling (SAM) System</a>--developed by associate professors of computer engineering <font color="#003399"><b>Richard Hughey, Kevin Karplus,</b></font> and others in the Computational Biology Group--has been recognized as a "Key Resource" in bioinformatics by the Internet service <a href="http://www.links2go.net/">Links2Go</a>. The SAM software system is a collection of tools used to analyze the structure of DNA and protein molecules. Links2Go provides Internet search and directory services based on a topical directory compiled and prioritized by proprietary automated technology. The Key Resource Award means that Links2Go's objective analysis identified the SAM web site as one of the most useful links on the topic of bioinformatics.

<h3>
  <font color="#003399"><b>Hi Kyung Kim</b></font>
</h3>

<p>
  Composer and assistant professor of music Hi Kyung Kim has received two prestigious grants for a work-in-progress.<br>
  <br>
  <img align="right" border="0" height="159" src="../art/kim.126.jpg" width="126" alt="">The first is a $20,000 grant from Meet The Composer, sponsored by the Commissioning Music/USA 2000 program, the nation's preeminent program for the support of new musical works. That grant will be shared by Kim and fellow Bay Area composer, Andrew Imbrie, who are both working on pieces commissioned by the Chamber Music Society of Minnesota (CMSM) and cellist Yo-Yo Ma. Kim's piece commemorates the victims of the Nanjing Massacre in China in 1937. The premiere of that piece will be May 30, 2001, at the Orchestra Hall in Minneapolis.<br>
  <br>
  The second award comes from the Serge Koussevitzky Music Foundation of the Library of Congress and the Koussevitzky Music Foundation of New York. The $15,000 grant also funds Kim's piece for the CMSM. The Koussevitzky awards are given annually on a competitive basis and are open to performing organizations or individuals and to composers. Manuscripts of the composer's works are deposited in the Music Division of the Library of Congress.<br>

<p>
  UCSC Arboretum
</p>The UCSC Arboretum hosted "Art in the Arboretum" and "New Zealand Day" together in late May. Chancellor Greenwood and <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/arboretum/">Arboretum</a> staff greeted the two consul generals of New Zealand for the festivities and led them on tours of the New Zealand garden.
<p>
  The Arboretum event was one of Consul General Darryl Dunn's first official functions since taking over his new duties, which include responsibilities in 13 western states of the U.S.<br>
  <br>
  The day was marked with dancing, Maori stories for children, craft demonstrations, flower arranging, and art shows by local artists and a New Zealand artist. Thirteen pieces about the New Zealand Bush by the New Zealand artist Rei Hamon were displayed and then donated to the Arboretum for a continuing show in Horticulture Building II.<br>
  <br>
  A new dance, "Zap! The Garden," was performed in the outback of the Australian garden. Polynesian dances were held in the New Zealand garden. Many of the dancers were current or former UCSC students, and "Zap!" was choreographed by professor of theater arts Mel Wong.<br>
  <br>
  Joan Norvelle, Shirley Beneke, and other talented volunteers produced the event in conjunction with Arboretum staff. Funds raised support the Arboretum.

        <title>UC President writes to lab managers and employees</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 03 Jul 2000 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>

        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  By Jeff Garberson<br>
  UC Office of the President
</p>

<p>
  The President of the University of California sent letters to all UC managers and employees at the Lawrence Livermore and Los Alamos national laboratories in late June, discussing his thoughts, concerns and expectations on the role that the laboratories play in national security (read <a href="letters.html">letters</a>).
</p>

<p>
  President Richard C. Atkinson sent the letters to the directors of the laboratories who in turn distributed it to managers and employees. It is the first time that Atkinson has written directly to managers and employees. The UC system has operated the laboratories for the U.S. Department of Energy for more than 50 years.<br>
  <br>
  In the letter, Atkinson told managers, "The recent security incident at Los Alamos is a stark reminder to managers at all levels of the seriousness of the national security endeavor entrusted to your supervision." He wrote, "We need the commitment of every manager to ensure that all aspects of security related to your respective areas of responsibility are appropriately designed, effectively implemented and consistently practiced.
</p>

<p>
  "Over the coming months, we will assess carefully our security practices and how the culture of our workplaces affects security. We must have your participation and leadership in support of timely and effective security improvement."<br>
  <br>
  He concluded, "I have enormous confidence in your ability to identify and change any practice or attitude that is not fully consistent with the protection of classified material. We must quickly reinvigorate our security posture in order to regain the nation's full confidence in the University's and the laboratories' role in national security."<br>
  <br>
  In a separate letter to employees, Atkinson said, "I believe that it is important for each of us to demonstrate now more than ever that the nation's trust has been well placed."<br>
  <br>
  He continued, "The University, through you, can continue to perform a critical national mission in a matter unmatched by any other institution."
</p>

<p>
  Atkinson noted, "No one should assume that security is someone else's responsibility. It is essential that everyone bear this responsibility, especially those of you who have firsthand knowledge of the importance of the laboratories' national security mission."<br>
  <br>
  Letters from both C. Bruce Tarter, director of the Livermore Laboratory, and John C. Browne, director of the Los Alamos Laboratory, were also sent to all employees.
</p>

<p>
  Under contract with the U.S. Department of Energy, UC manages Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California and Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. The laboratories conduct broad and diverse basic and applied research in nuclear science, energy production, national defense, and environmental and health areas.<br>
  <br>
  The letters were sent only to the Livermore and Los Alamos national laboratories because they are specifically charged with protecting the nation through advanced research in national security.

        <title>State budget invests in UC teaching, research, public service</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 03 Jul 2000 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>

        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  Governor Gray Davis signed a 2000-01 state budget June 30 that funds student enrollment growth at the University of California, expansion of UC's programs for K-12 teachers, increased compensation for university employees, improvements in UC hospital infrastructure, and the creation of three new science institutes pursuing research important to the California economy.<br>
  <br>
  The budget also provides funds to keep UC mandatory systemwide student fees even and to reduce summer fees to the level of the rest of the academic year, starting in summer 2001.<br>
  <br>
  "This budget allows us to maintain access to a high-quality, affordable education for all UC-eligible students while also making strategic investments in research, health care and outreach to California's elementary and secondary schools," said UC President Richard C. Atkinson. "I speak for the entire University of California community in thanking the governor and the legislature for their extraordinary support."<br>
  <br>
  With the benefit of exceptionally strong state revenues, the new budget increases UC's state-funded operating budget by $486 million, or 18 percent, to $3.2 billion for the 2000-01 fiscal year. The state-funded capital budget for UC is $346 million, consisting of $213 million in Proposition 1A bond funds and $133 million in state general funds. The budget also authorizes the university to use $600 million in lease-revenue bond funds for earthquake-safety renovations at UC hospitals.<br>
  <br>
  Highlights of the budget for UC include:<br>
  <br>
  <b>Enrollment growth:</b> The budget funds enrollment growth of 6,000 students, or 4 percent. This increase includes the next steps in UC's multi-year effort to double the number of students in its teacher credential programs and to expand engineering and computer science enrollments by 50 percent to help meet California's workforce needs in these fields.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Student fees:</b> The budget provides funds to avoid a mandatory systemwide fee increase for the sixth consecutive year, keeping fees at $3,429 for resident undergraduates and $3,609 for resident graduate academic students, excluding campus-based miscellaneous fees. Between 1998-99 and 1999-2000, mandatory systemwide fees actually decreased 10 percent for resident undergraduates and 5 percent for resident graduate academic students.<br>
  <br>
  The budget also will make classes during the summer more affordable for UC students. The state historically has not funded the summer session at UC, so students have been required to pay higher fees to cover instructional costs. The new budget provides funding to make summer fees equivalent with the rest of the academic year, starting in 2001.<br>
  <br>
  Expansion of summer instruction is one of UC's strategies for accommodating an expected 40 percent enrollment increase by 2010. The university will continue seeking additional state funds for the faculty, staff and other costs associated with an expanded summer term.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Employee compensation:</b> The budget includes funding for employee salary increases, with additional funding especially for employees in lower-paid positions, as described below. These are not across-the-board increases; actual pay increases will vary depending upon an employee's compensation program and applicable collective bargaining requirements.<br>
  <br>
  Funding is provided for an average 2 percent employee salary increase, plus normal merit increases; an additional 1 percent market-based adjustment for faculty members, to keep UC salaries competitive with those offered by its comparison institutions; and market-based adjustments for cooperative extension specialists and certain information technology employees. The governor also has approved an augmentation of $19 million for salaries of staff employees and other employees not eligible for the faculty market-based adjustment, with a priority on improving compensation for lower-paid UC employees. The exact distribution of these funds has not yet been determined.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Undergraduate education:</b> The budget includes $6 million to improve undergraduate instruction, the first installment of an investment that UC hopes to eventually expand to $50 million per year. Campuses will be able to use the funding to reduce class sizes, offer additional lower-division seminars, provide more undergraduate research opportunities, and offer more academic advising, among other things.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Outreach and K-14 programs:</b> The budget includes $71 million to create or expand UC-led programs providing professional development to teachers in California's public schools. Major elements of this package include expansion of the California Subject Matter Projects, which provide subject-specific professional development activities; expansion of the Governor's Reading Professional Development Institutes for K-3 teachers; and creation of similar professional development institutes for high school math and English teachers.<br>
  <br>
  Beyond teacher development programs, the budget also includes a $4 million augmentation to a UC program (led by UCSC) providing online Advanced Placement courses to students in schools with few or no AP classes; a $1 million expansion for the California State Summer School for Math and Science, which provides enrichment to academically talented high school students; a $1 million augmentation for the Mathematics, Engineering, Science Achievement (MESA) program; $1 million for an initiative to improve community college transfer to UC; and $1 million for graduate and professional school outreach.
</p>

<p>
  The budget also provides $600,000 for UCSC's New Teacher Center.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Santa Clara Valley regional center:</b> The budget provides $1.1 million to begin planning a UC Santa Cruz regional center in the Silicon Valley, part of the university's plans for accommodating student enrollment growth in the next decade.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Health care facilities:</b> The budget provides $50 million for non-seismic infrastructure needs at UC's five teaching hospitals, $25 million in one-time funds for hospital equipment needs, and authorization to use $600 million in funding from lease-revenue bonds for earthquake-safety renovations needed at UC medical centers.<br>
  <br>
  <b>California Institutes for Science and Innovation:</b> UC's capital budget includes $75 million for the creation of these three institutes, proposed by Gov. Davis, which will focus on scientific and engineering research in fields key to the future of the California economy. Each institute will bring together faculty, students and industrial partners to work in cross-disciplinary teams aimed at developing the next generation of knowledge in the field. Preliminary proposals for the centers are being reviewed, and selections will be made in the fall.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Capital program:</b> The capital budget, which includes $213 million in bond funds approved by voters through Prop. 1A, will fund a variety of projects throughout the UC system to expand and upgrade academic buildings for enrollment growth, renew outdated infrastructure, and make earthquake-safety improvements. Also, $4 million in general funds is provided for planning alterations and new facilities at the UC Davis School of Veterinary Medicine to address accreditation requirements.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Building maintenance and other core needs:</b> The budget includes a 1 percent increase, or $26 million, in ongoing funds for building maintenance, instructional technology, instructional equipment and library materials at UC. It also provides an additional $20 million in one-time funds specifically for deferred maintenance, instructional equipment and libraries.<br>
  <br>
  <b>UC Merced:</b> The budget provides $44 million through two state agencies to foster the development of the new UC Merced campus in environmentally sensitive ways, including development of a habitat conservation plan and acquisition of additional acreage to ensure protection of wetlands and wildlife. The budget also provides $19 million for initial infrastructure and for planning and working drawings of the first two buildings at UC Merced--the Science and Engineering Building and the Library/Information Technology Center. The budget includes approximately $10 million in ongoing operating funds for the campus.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Internet2:</b> UC will use $50 million in the new budget to expand access to Internet2, the high-speed next-generation electronic highway. Of this amount, $32 million will be used to expand Internet2 access at K-12 schools; $18 million will be used for that purpose at UC campuses.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Graduate medical education:</b> The budget's implementing legislation extends for two years a program that uses state funds to leverage federal dollars to help fund the costs of providing graduate medical education at UC teaching hospitals.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Research initiatives:</b> The budget includes more than $60 million for a variety of other research initiatives. Highlights include $30 million for the MIND Institute (Medical Investigation of Neurodevelopmental Disorders) at UC Davis; $6 million to expand the university's research efforts on labor issues affecting California's workforce; $5 million for collaboration with Mexican scholars on U.S.-Mexico issues; and $5 million for expanded research in the fields of engineering and computer science.

<p>
  A cosmic art exhibit of paintings and prints by astronomical artist Lynette R. Cook will be on display at the Visitor Center at Lick Observatory through September 30.
</p><br>
Lick Observatory, located atop Mt. Hamilton about 20 miles east of San Jose, is open to the public Monday through Friday from 12:30 to 5 p.m. and Saturday and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Visitors who attend special summer programs in the evenings will also be able to view the exhibit.<br>
<br>
Highlighting the exhibit are portraits of extrasolar planets discovered by the Marcy/Butler Planet Search Project. The project's planet hunters, who include UCSC astronomer Steven Vogt and UCSC alumni Geoffrey Marcy and Debra Fischer, made many of their discoveries at Lick Observatory.
<p>
  Since 1995, Cook has been working with Marcy and Fischer, both now at UC Berkeley, to create images of these extrasolar planets as they might actually appear. Since the planets cannot be imaged directly, Cook blends the scientific data with her own creative expression to depict these far-off worlds accurately and realistically.<br>
  <br>
  This, in fact, is the role of an astronomical artist: to blend art and science into a unified whole for the purpose of educating others about astronomy and science.<br>
  <br>
  The 27 paintings and prints in the exhibition include realistic and conceptual works of other astronomical subjects in addition to extrasolar planets. Among the subjects Cook explores in her work are the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence (SETI) and the cosmic puzzle of dark matter and missing mass in the universe.<br>
  <br>
  Most of Cook's works are traditional paintings: mixed-media combinations of acrylic, colored pencil, and gouache on illustration board. She also occasionally uses acrylic gouache, graphite, ink, pastel, and watercolor. In the past year, Cook has been working with digital methods as well and has included one digital print in the exhibit.<br>
  <br>
  Visitors may recognize some of Cook's images of extrasolar planets, which have been widely published. They have appeared in planetarium shows, in television documentaries airing on BBC, CNN, PBS, the Discovery Channel, and the Learning Channel, and in books, newspapers, and magazines, including the periodicals <i>Astronomy, Eos</i> (Belgium), <i>Pacific Discovery, Science et Vie</i> (France), <i>Science News,</i> and <i>Sky & Telescope.</i>
</p>
<h3>
  About the Artist
</h3>
<p>
  Interested in both art and science since childhood, Lynette Cook double-majored in biology/drawing and painting at the Mississippi University for Women. She completed a bachelor of science degree in 1981 and received a bachelor of fine arts degree a year later.
</p>
<p>
  Cook then moved west to attend the California College of Arts and Crafts, specializing in scientific illustration through the Drawing Department. An internship at the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco eventually led to the staff job of artist/photographer for the Morrison Planetarium, a position she still holds.<br>
  <br>
  Since 1984, Cook has maintained a freelance career, providing natural science illustrations for clients including <i>Final Frontier, Fine Cooking, Food For Thought,</i> Houghton Mifflin, <i>Omni, RN,</i> The Nature Company, and Time-Life Books. Cook initially focused on botanical and biological subjects, but now specializes in astronomical imagery (<a href="http://www.spaceart.org/lcook/">view more of Cook's work</a>).<br>
  <br>
  Cook is a fellow of the International Association of Astronomical Artists and a member of the Guild of Natural Science Illustrators and the San Francisco Society of Illustrators. She has exhibited her award-winning art across the country at major museums, research centers, and universities, including the American Museum of Natural History and the Smithsonian Institution. Since 1994, Cook has been associated with the Science Photo Library, which makes her illustrations available to publications throughout the world.

<p>
  When psychology professor Aida Hurtado toured the White House as a graduate student nearly 20 years ago, it never occurred to her that she would return one day to discuss national educational policy with the president.
</p><br>
But that's what she did as part of a daylong White House Strategy Session on improving the achievement of Hispanic students. Hurtado, who helped coordinate the UC-wide Latino Eligibility Task Force in the early 1990s, was one of about 100 scholars, educators, and policy makers from around the country who were invited to attend the session.<br>
<br>
As a group, participants discussed five major educational objectives and then met with Bill Clinton in the White House.<br>
<br>
"It was amazing," said Hurtado. "The president stayed with us for 2 1/2 hours, which is unheard of, apparently. He usually just stays for the opening remarks or the ceremonial part of an event."<br>
<br>
The strategy session was the backdrop for the president's announcement of the formation of the 2010 Alliance, a partnership of corporate, foundation, and community leaders that will seek to double the number of Hispanic students who graduate from college over the next ten years. News of the alliance was covered in the <i>Los Angeles Times,</i> the <i>San Francisco Chronicle,</i> the <i>Chicago Tribune,</i> and the <i>Chronicle of Higher Education,</i> among other papers.<br>
<br>
The meeting was convened to identify strategies to reach the following Hispanic student achievement goals:
<ul>
  <li>Increase access to quality early childhood education
  </li>
  <li>Eliminate the achievement gap
  </li>
  <li>Ensure that Hispanic students achieve English language proficiency
  </li>
  <li>Increase the rate of high school completion
  </li>
  <li>Increase the college completion rate
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  "It's kind of sad, actually, because Clinton understands the problems so well, and he's laying the map and won't be able to carry it out," said Hurtado. "Somebody else will be elected. Hopefully he'll pick it up."<br>
  <br>
  Hurtado led the panel on eliminating the achievement gap in Hispanic educational achievement, which she said takes two forms: a high dropout rate and a lack of attention and resources directed to high-achieving Hispanic students. In 1998, Hurtado said, the dropout rate for Hispanics aged 16-24 was 30 percent--more than double the rate for blacks (14 percent) and more than three times the rate for whites (8 percent).<br>
  <br>
  "The emphasis in both research and policy is to focus on why students underachieve," she said. "But at the same time, there are also some high-achieving Hispanic students, and we are doing little to support them. Some high school students who are doing very well academically know absolutely nothing about how to apply to college, and that's hurting us in terms of the educational pipeline. And they are ones who are the most likely to come back and help the rest of the students in their school districts."<br>
  <br>
  The problem calls for a two-part strategy, said Hurtado: a long-term focus on improving the performance of K-12 students, and a short-term focus on helping high achievers move up to the next level of education.<br>
  <br>
  Hurtado said the gathering had historic as well as personal significance. "I thought I would be somewhat blase or unimpressed, but it was amazing, and it was historic, really, to have 100 Hispanic leaders in direct consultation with the president," she said. The discussion with Clinton, who was well-prepared, had a natural ebb and flow, said Hurtado. "It was very intimate, not at all stilted," she added.<br>
  <br>
  "They had gathered the right kind of people, committed people," said Hurtado. "There was a lot of passion in the room. And these are people who often work in isolation, feeling like they are the only ones worrying about these things."<br>
  <br>
  After the meeting, participants were invited to tour the entire first floor of the White House--the Red Room, the Green Room, the Blue Room--and attended a reception held in the state dining room. Hurtado mentioned a comment Clinton made after the reporters had left the press briefing.<br>
  <br>
  "He said he thinks he'll be the last non-Spanish speaking president in this country," she said. Clinton has learned to read Spanish but feels self-conscious speaking the language, whereas Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic nominee for president who addressed the meeting via satellite, sprinkled his ten-minute talk with four or five sentences in Spanish. Republican presidential contender George W. Bush has been studying Spanish much longer, but Gore's command of the language is better, said Hurtado.

        <title>New oral history documents one of country's oldest women's health centers</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 03 Jul 2000 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>2487</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  A new oral history on the director of one of Santa Cruz's oldest women's health centers, as well as one of the most long-lived in the U.S., has just been released by the <a href="http://library.ucsc.edu/reg-hist/index.html">Regional History Project</a> of the University Library. Titled <i>Ciel Benedetto: A History of the Santa Cruz Women's Health Center, 1985-2000,</i> the volume is the memoir of Benedetto. Assistant Editor Irene Reti conducted two interviews with Benedetto and coedited the volume with Project Director Randall Jarrell. In her memoir, Santa Cruz Women's Health Center (SCWHC) director Benedetto traces the evolution of this unique community institution, now celebrating its 25th anniversary. Founded in 1974 as a pioneering, feminist health collective, SCWHC is now a thriving health organization operating in today's complex managed care environment. Benedetto has guided the center through this transition, maintaining its feminist perspective while overseeing an annual budget of more than $1 million. SCWHC is one of the country's few remaining women's health centers and now provides more than 8,000 patient visits annually in general medicine, gynecology, prenatal care, family planning, and pediatrics. The agency also provides information and referral services, low-cost acupuncture, free mental health and nutritional counseling, and health and HIV education. Benedetto begins her commentary with a discussion of the agency's socialist-feminist political origins as a collective and its commitment to consensus decision making. This phase eventually gave way to a more traditional organizational structure as the agency matured.
</p>

<p>
  Benedetto details the agency's myriad activities, including its highly developed volunteer training program, which has produced a remarkable number of alumni over the years who have become agents of change as physicians, health care providers, and women's rights advocates.<br>
  <br>
  Among the other activities of the center are the production of its internationally distributed newsletter and health education materials; the provision of new contraceptive methods such as the cervical cap; and its participation in breast cancer research studies. SCWHC has maintained its commitment to diversity in its staff and patient population over the years and has a singular reputation among international health agencies for women and children.<br>
  <br>
  Bound, indexed copies of this volume can be ordered from the Regional History Project at (831) 459-2847 or via e-mail to ihreti@cats.ucsc.edu. The volume is also available for viewing at Special Collections, <a href="http://library.ucsc.edu/mchenry/">McHenry Library</a>, and at <a href="http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/BANC/">Bancroft Library</a>, UC Berkeley.<br>

<p>
  In an intensive effort over the past few months, UCSC researchers created a powerful new computer program and used it to assemble the "working draft" of the human genome announced last week by leaders of the international <a href="http://www.ornl.gov/TechResources/Human_Genome/">Human Genome Project</a>.
</p><br>
At a press conference in Washington, D.C., Francis Collins, director of the National Human Genome Research Institute at the National Institutes of Health, and other leaders of the Human Genome Project public consortium announced that the consortium has completed a working draft of the sequence of the human genome--the genetic blueprint for a human being.<br>
<br>
The <a href="dna.html">public release</a> of this working draft is a landmark achievement, although much work remains to be done. The Human Genome Project involves a public consortium of more than 1,000 scientists at institutions in the United States and Europe. David Haussler, professor of computer science and director of the Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering at UCSC, joined the project early this year. Haussler has been working closely with Eric Lander, director of the Genome Center at MIT's Whitehead Institute, who is directing the computational analysis of the human genome data.<br>
<br>
"The analysis performed by Haussler's group at UC Santa Cruz was a crucial contribution to generating this working draft of the human genome sequence," Lander said.<br>
<br>
Five laboratories, including Lander's group, have produced most of the raw data, determining the sequences of chemical building blocks that make up the DNA in human chromosomes.
<p>
  The human genetic code is spelled out in roughly 3 billion DNA subunits, called bases, arranged in specific sequences on the chromosomes. To determine those sequences, Genome Project scientists divided the chromosomal DNA into about 25,000 small overlapping regions for analysis by automated sequencing machines.<br>
  <br>
  The sequencing procedures yielded sequences for many random fragments of DNA from each region, providing a total of about 400,000 sequenced fragments of human DNA. Having obtained the sequences of these random fragments, however, the researchers faced a major challenge in trying to reassemble them to represent the sequences of each of the 23 human chromosomes as accurately as possible.<br>
  <br>
  "The computational analysis we performed was to try to determine the proper order and orientation of each piece and to join overlapping pieces of the sequence together," Haussler said.<br>
  <br>
  Jim Kent, a graduate student in biology at UCSC who has a background in computer science, designed and wrote most of the software used to perform the analysis, and he did it in a remarkably short time frame. "He has done a phenomenal job of creating the software to do this very complex operation," Haussler said.<br>
  <br>
  The working draft generated by this analysis incorporates all of the sequence data available as of June 15. It covers 85 percent of the genome and is 99.9 percent accurate. The researchers will continue to fill in the remaining gaps and improve the order and orientation of the fragments as more sequence data becomes available. They will also begin analyzing the working draft to locate the genes buried within the genome sequence.<br>
  <br>
  The ultimate goal of the Human Genome Project is to identify and understand the function of all of the genes contained within the human genome. This information will be a boon to biomedical researchers, helping them to identify genes related to specific diseases, to understand how genetic variations affect susceptibility to diseases and responses to drugs, and to design new drugs. Of the human diseases known to be linked to specific genes, 95 percent are associated with genes that have already been located in the working draft of the genome.<br>
  <br>
  "We are going through a portal, opening a door to a new world," Haussler said. "When I saw the fragments from Jim Kent's first assembly of the genome come flying across my computer screen, I thought, 'This is it...this is our genome.' It is hard to describe the sense of wonder I felt."<br>
  <br>
  The milestone comes 15 years after the idea of mapping the human genome was first discussed at a historic meeting at UCSC in May 1985. Molecular biologist Robert L. Sinsheimer, then Chancellor of UCSC, brought together about 20 leading biologists from Europe and the United States to discuss the feasibility of such a project. The U.S. Human Genome Project was formally launched in 1990.<br>
  <br>
  In addition to Kent, Haussler's team at UCSC includes Nick Littlestone, a visiting scientist at the Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering; Scott Kennedy, a graduate student in mathematics; Patrick Gavin, who just graduated from UCSC with a B.S. in computer science; and systems consultant Paul Tatarsky.<br>
  <br>
  Haussler expects to perform a new analysis soon incorporating all of the additional sequence data available since June 15. He and his collaborators will be trying to get a handle on how many genes there are, where they are located, what their structures are, and what their functions might be.<br>
  <br>
  "The analysis of the genes is the most challenging part of this whole undertaking, and it is also the most interesting because that is where the potential lies for making major discoveries," Haussler said.

<p>
  <i>For the last few months,</i> Currents Online <i>has followed the progress of two members of the campus community with varied fitness backgrounds as they pursued their fitness goals. This is the last report of the academic year.</i>
</p>
<p>
  The new campus <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/opers/wellness/pages/wellness_main.html">Wellness Center</a> has captured the hearts--and improved the cardiovascular fitness--of hundreds of people on campus, including Katrina Cope and Gene Switkes, who have honored their pledges to work out regularly in the facility that opened in January.<br>
</p><br>
"My use and enjoyment of the center has not waned as the newness of the center wears off," said Switkes, a chemistry professor who has used the Wellness Center's well-equipped weight rooms to round out his workout routines, which include tennis and running.<br>
<br>
"I keep finding additional benefits, including some really helpful guidance I've gotten from staff members and graduate student colleagues," said Switkes.
<p>
  Among his tutors are teaching assistants in an exercise physiology class offered by the Biology Department. "They've taught me about the relationship of exercise levels to cardiovascular conditioning and maximum fat metabolism."<br>
  <br>
  Both Switkes and Cope have introduced colleagues to the fitness facilities. Cope's supervisor has approached her about participating in the <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/opers/wellness/pages/classes.htm">Adopt-A-Slug</a> Exercise Mentorship Program for faculty and staff.
</p>
<p>
  The summer program introduces employees to the Wellness Center's facilities by pairing them with rec card holders and offering them 20 free visits. If they use all the visits within seven weeks, they and their mentor will receive a free T-shirt.
</p>
<p>
  "Anyone can exercise for two or three weeks, but seven weeks is a commitment," said Ryan Andrews, manager of the Wellness Center, who hopes to attract 75 new fitness converts through the incentive program.<br>
  <br>
  With students away from campus for the summer, the Wellness Center is crying out for more users. "It's empty! Get in here and use it!" said Andrews, adding that the first floor of the facility is <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/opers/wellness/pages/faculty.htm">reserved for use</a> by faculty and staff only each day from noon to 1 p.m. and 5:30 to 6:30 p.m.<br>
  <br>
  Having conquered an early spring slump, Cope has declared her experiment in fitness such a success that she plans to continue her lunch-hour workouts through the summer and into the next academic year<br>
  <br>
  "I think it's getting started that's the hardest part--overcoming that inertia," said Cope, who is enjoying the satisfaction of having lost inches and improving her strength and endurance. "I'm able to fit into my clothes better, and I definitely feel less stressed when I go back to work after a class. It's refreshing to do this."<br>
  <br>
  Cope has maintained her twice-weekly lunch-hour "<a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/opers/wellness/pages/classes.htm">Express workouts</a>" and her success has inspired several other colleagues from Hahn Student Services to join the noon workout.<br>
  <br>
  After only six weeks, Barbara Ng, an assistant in the Admissions Office, said she noticed how much stronger she has become when she hoisted her suitcase into the overhead luggage bin on an airplane.
</p>
<p>
  "I had to carry my suitcase up two flights of stairs, and I wasn't out of breath when I got there," she added. "It builds confidence when you're out in the world."<br>
  <br>
  New services offered at the Wellness Center include <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/opers/wellness/pages/fitness_testing.htm">fitness testing</a>, personal trainers, and training on the Technogym exercise equipment. A comprehensive fitness assessment, which includes cardiovascular testing, flexibility testing, bodyfat content, and strength and endurance testing, is available for $30. Individual tests can be scheduled for $5 each.<br>
  <br>
  Fees for personal trainers are $30 per hour for students and $35 per hour for faculty and staff. "The goal of working with a trainer really should be to work together three or four times, then go out on your own," said Andrews. "After that, you can meet periodically for motivation and to reprogram your workout."<br>
  <br>
  The Technogym equipment, considered the most cutting-edge technology-based equipment in the world, enables users to develop customized exercise programs that deliver optimum results. Using the Technogym Smartkey, the system saves all workout data in a personalized database that makes charting progress easy. Training sessions, made up of three 75-minute classes, begin June 26.<br>
  <br>
  While other students in the Express Workout have come and gone, Cope and her colleague and friend April Goral have been regulars. "We took Ryan out to lunch to thank him--and he ate a dessert," Cope recalled with glee. "It's important to treat your coach right, too."<br>
  <br>
  Cope's new goal is to reach the one-year mark on her road to lifelong fitness. "I feel like I'll hit a milestone if I hit a year," she said. Meanwhile, she plans to do a follow-up fitness assessment in September to see what progress she has made over six months.

        <title>Working draft of human genome sequence now publicly available on UCSC web site</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 03 Jul 2000 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>2480</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  UCSC researchers who performed the computer analysis to assemble a working draft of the human genome sequence have now posted their results on a UCSC <a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu">web site</a>. Biomedical researchers throughout the world can now search the working draft for particular genes or DNA sequences of interest to them. A group led by David Haussler, professor of computer science and director of the Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering, created a powerful new computer program to assemble the working draft from the sequence data obtained by the international Human Genome Project (see <a href="haussler.html">related story</a>). The policy of the public consortium of scientists working on the Human Genome Project has been to release sequence information to the world as soon as possible. Until the working draft was assembled, however, the sequence data were only available in many small pieces. "This is the first publicly available view of the human genome sequence tentatively placed in the order and orientation in which we think it occurs along the human chromosomes," Haussler said. Haussler noted that after a 10-year effort involving many laboratories and more than 1,000 scientists, the human genome can now be downloaded from the UCSC web site in about an hour and a half by anyone with a DSL-speed Internet connection. The genome sequence is essentially a long string of As, Ts, Cs, and Gs, representing the chemical units of DNA, called bases. The human genome consists of approximately 3.1 billion bases arrayed along the length of the chromosomes. Scientists involved in the Human Genome Project have sequenced about 85 percent of the human genome and continue to generate new sequence data at a rapid pace. Haussler's group will rerun their computer analysis every few weeks, incorporating new data so that biomedical researchers will have immediate access to the most up-to-date assembly. Although the current working draft still has some gaps and uncertainty in it, it is already extremely useful for most biomedical research purposes, said Alan Zahler, an associate professor of biology at UCSC. In many cases, researchers have identified part of a gene or have other clues to the gene's sequence. They can now use that information to search the genome for the rest of the sequence associated with the gene they are interested in. In addition, researchers who know the sequence of one gene can search the genome for similar sequences to find related genes. Many genes are members of multigene families with similar and sometimes overlapping functions, Zahler said. "Identification of all of the members of a gene family will give us a sense for how many genes with a certain role are present in the genome," Zahler said. "Before, it took long periods of experimentation to find out whether a gene in humans was a member of a larger family of genes." As a test for completeness of the working draft, Human Genome Project scientists searched the draft for known genes associated with human genetic diseases and found 95 percent of those diseases had identifiable genes in the working draft. "The chances of finding a particular disease gene in the working draft are apparently quite good," Haussler said. "Technically, the working draft only covers about 85 percent of the genome, but in practice it appears to cover 95 percent of the disease genes." The working draft is also an exciting beginning for scientists interested in understanding gene structure and organization in humans, Zahler noted.
</p>

<p>
  "For the first time, we will be able to look at tens of thousands of genes at once and start to search for common themes in areas such as how classes of genes are turned on and off, how the information in genes is processed into a form that encodes proteins, and how that processing is regulated," he said.<br>
  <br>
  Jim Kent, a graduate student working with Zahler, designed and wrote most of the software used to assemble the working draft, which was compiled from hundreds of thousands of fragments of various sizes.<br>
  <br>
  "Imagine you have five copies of <i>War and Peace</i> and one of <i>Crime and Punishment,</i> you put them through a paper shredder, and then try to paste together a single copy of <i>War and Peace</i> from the shreds," Kent said. "That job would be a lot like assembling the human genome, except that the genome runs to about a million pages."<br>
  <br>
  Haussler said Kent's accomplishments will have a very real impact on science and medicine. "He has shown enormous talent and creativity in tackling this fundamental problem," Haussler said.<br>
  <br>
  In addition to the UCSC web site, the working draft will also be available on sites maintained by the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov">National Center for Biotechnology Information</a> and the <a href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/">European Bioinformatics Institute</a>. Both NCBI and EBI are major contributors to the computational analysis of the human genome data. Haussler has already sent them the current working draft and will continue to send them updated versions as new sequence data are incorporated into the analysis.<br>

        <title>Conferences and camps keep UCSC busy for the summer</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 03 Jul 2000 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>

        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  Some 15,000 visitors from more than 30 countries are expected to come to UCSC this summer to participate in more than 100 conferences, academic institutes, camps, and outreach programs.
</p>

<p>
  The ten-week conference season started on June 18 and will run to August 26 this year. Its diverse offerings range from a conference focusing on the biology and ecology of larval forms of life to an annual retreat for the El Camino Youth Symphony.
</p>

<p>
  The conference program generates more than $3.5 million annually for UCSC. Conference guests occupy the 2,400 beds at UCSC's nine residential colleges, purchasing food and other services from the campus. Income from the summer helps to offset room-and-board rates charged to UCSC students by about $200 each year. Income is also returned to UCSC's colleges to help support student programs.
</p>

<p>
  "The conference season greatly benefits members of the local community as well," said Nancy D'Angelo, assistant director of Housing, Dining, and Child Care Services. "The 15,000 visitors brought to the area by these conferences and camps often spend money at local businesses."
</p>

<p>
  Approximately 60 percent of summer bookings come from UCSC Extension, Summer Session, and academic programs sponsored by faculty and staff. Businesses, sport and school groups, and professional organizations make up the remaining 40 percent.
</p>

<p>
  For more information about this summer's conferences or about services offered by UCSC's Conference and Summer Housing Office, call (831) 459-2611 or go to their <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/conference/">Web site</a>. This year's conferences include:<br>
  <br>
  <b>*</b> <a href="http://www.biology.UCSC.EDU/larval2000/"><b>Larval 2000</b></a> (June 24-28). At the Fourth International Larval Biology Meeting, some 200 researchers and professors will discuss the ecology and evolutionary biology of the larval stages of all aquatic organisms. Through informal symposia and reports of research-in-progress, the conference will address questions such as: Are larval forms of fish and invertebrates being destroyed by toxic releases from sewers, agriculture, and oil production? Where do fish and invertebrates birth their young? Why do organisms, from rockfish to barnacles, take up residence where they do?<br>
  <br>
  <b>*</b> <a href="http://www.jhu.edu/gifted"><b>Johns Hopkins-Center for Talented Youth</b></a> (June 25-August 4). The Center for Talented Youth draws students from 40 states and 38 countries who are within the top 2 percent of their age group academically. The youth participate in three-week sessions. Students from grades five and six study topics such as writing and imagination, and those in grades seven, eight, and nine tackle subjects ranging from engineering design to neurobiology and the cold war.<br>
  <br>
  <b>*</b> <a href="http://epc.ucsc.edu/cosmos"><b>California State Summer School in Mathematics and Science</b></a> (June 26-July 22). This new summer school program, nicknamed "COSMOS," introduces academically gifted high school students to advanced topics not traditionally covered in high school curricula. COSMOS programs are taking place this summer at UC Santa Cruz and UC Irvine and were started in partnership with the state legislature.

        <title>Biology Department offers new 'ecology and evolution' major</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  The Biology Department has received approval to offer a new B.S. degree in ecology and evolution and will begin admitting students to the new major in fall of 2000. In addition to the new major, the department has made several changes in biology degree titles:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>addition of a B.S. to the existing biology B.A. offering<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>replacement of the B.A. with a B.S. in marine biology<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>replacement of the B.A. with a B.S. in molecular, cellular, and developmental biology.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  The new ecology and evolution major will give students a broad background in biology and an in-depth understanding of ecology and evolutionary biology. In addition, students will be encouraged to have a concentration in one of four areas: ecology, behavioral ecology, physiological ecology, or evolution.<br>
  <br>
  "There has been an informal pathway for students with a strong interest in ecology and evolutionary biology, but the new major provides a structured program and ensures that students will come out with a strong degree," said professor of biology Laurel Fox.

<p>
  Summer wouldn't be summer without certain things: barbecues, beach outings, mosquito bites, and, of course, a great book or two to get lost in. For those who are still searching for that perfect read, UCSC faculty and staff have some recommendations (after all, we know a lot about books around here).
</p>Fiction
<p>
  <b>Angle of Repose</b> by Wallace Stegner (Doubleday, 1971; Modern Library, 2000). A retired professor imagines the experiences of his grandparents as he pieces together their pioneer life in San Jose, Santa Cruz, Colorado, Idaho, and finally Nevada City. As he interprets the traces they left behind in an abundant collection of letters, sketches, reportages, and photographs, glossed by his own memories, he has painful realizations about the likely reality of their interior lives as well as his own.<br>
  --Janet Jones, Assistant, Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry<br>
  <br>
  <b>Breath, Eyes, Memory</b> by Edwidge Danticat (Soho, 1994). A luminous book that explores a Haitian woman's relationship with her mother, and moves between the Haiti of her childhood and New York. Very powerful.<br>
  --Patricia Zavella, Professor of Community Studies<br>
  <br>
  <b>Close Range: Wyoming Stories</b> by Annie Proulx (Scribner's, 1999). It's fantastic--a short story collection that captures the essence of the West. Each one different, each one a gem.<br>
  --Sandra Faber, University Professor of Astronomy and Astrophysics<br>
  <br>
  <b>The Count of Monte Cristo</b> by Alexandre Dumas (various publishers; originally published in French in 1844). This is not great literature, but it is a great read. It's more than just a melodramatic story of personal revenge, although it is that, but it's chiefly a novel of manners: pages, for example, on the differences between how audiences behave at the opera in Rome and in Paris. --Gary Miles, Professor of History<br>
  <br>
  <b>Dancing at the Rascal Fair</b> by Ivan Doig (Atheneum, 1987). A chronicle of western pioneering, this is a vivid account of the glorious dreams and harsh realities of two untried but highly principled young Scots who settle in the Two Medicine area of western Montana in the late 1800s--one as a sheep rancher, the other as a schoolteacher. Doig follows his protagonists, who sail away in steerage from unpromising futures as apprentice wheelwrights in a poor, muddy village, to the wild, raw, open-sky foothills of the Rockies. This page-turner tells the compelling story of their friendship and enmity, of frustrated love, and a mismatched marriage, through four decades of western history.<br>
  --Janet Jones, Assistant, Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry<br>
  <br>
  <b>The Debt to Pleasure</b> by John Lanchester (Henry Holt, 1996). A great summer read: funny, quirky and intellectually satisfying. Part Don Quixote, part Martha Stewart gone mad. The narrator embarks on writing a great work of art, a cookbook. The mix of ingredients, however, create instead an offbeat, neurotic, and snobbish mix of philosophy, travelogue, gastronomy, and mischief. I never get tired of reading excerpts of this hilarious book to friends.<br>
  --Martin Wollesen, Director, Arts & Lectures
</p>
<p>
  <b>Disgrace</b> by J. M. Coetzee (Secker & Warburg, 1999; Viking, 1999). A South African writer. This book won the Booker Prize in 1999. A university professor lost in postmodern South Africa. Bleak but brilliant.<br>
  --Paul Whitworth, Professor of Theater Arts and Shakespeare Santa Cruz Artistic Director<br>
  <br>
  <b>The Hours</b> by Michael Cunningham (Picador, 2000). A beautifully conceived novel by Pulitzer Prize-winner Cunningham. Sensitively and finely written as an homage to Virginia Woolf and, more than that, a stunning meditation on the strength of art as well as the ordinary to give meaning to the fragility of life. You need not have read any Virginia Woolf to appreciate this wonderful novel.<br>
  --Martin Wollesen, Director, Arts & Lectures<br>
  <br>
  <b>My Year of Meats</b> by Ruth Ozeki (Viking, 1998). A brilliant novel about meat, about being half, about domestic violence, about reproductive choices and impositions, about cultures, about hormones, about race, and about a lot more.<br>
  --Gwendolyn Mink, Professor of Politics<br>
  <br>
  <b>My Year of Meats</b> by Ruth Ozeki. This is an amazing first novel by a documentary filmmaker. I don't get to read enough fiction--this book I could not put down.<br>
  --Chip Lord, Professor of Film and Digital Media<br>
  <br>
  <b>Pillars of the Earth</b> by Ken Follett (William Morrow, 1994). About 12th-century life and the building of a cathedral and monastery, based in part on Salisbury and Canterbury Cathedrals and the chaos surrounding King Stephen's rule in England. Although I found most of his history believable, political and social historians find it fairly awry. It's a good read in any case.<br>
  --Virginia Jansen, Professor of Art History<br>
  <br>
  <b>Plainsong</b> by Kent Haruf (Knopf, 1999). Life stories of a multigenerational community on the Great Plains of northeastern Colorado. Classic literary style and heartfelt stories.<br>
  --Connie Creel, Linguistics Research Assistant<br>
  <br>
  <b>The Reader</b> by Bernhard Schlink (translated by Carol Brown Janeway) (Vintage, 1999). Set in postwar Germany, the story is told by a 15-year-old boy who falls in love with an older woman. She resurfaces later in his life when she is a defendant in a war crimes trial who is accused of an unspeakable crime. Beautifully written. Winner of <i>Boston Book Review's</i> Fisk Fiction Prize.<br>
  --Connie Creel, Linguistics Research Assistant<br>
  <br>
  <b>The Red Tent</b> by Anita Diamant (St. Martin's Press, 1997). It's the biblical story of Dinah (the only daughter of Jacob) retold from the female point of view. It was one of those books that I couldn't put down for two days until I finished it.<br>
  --Leta Miller, Professor of Music<br>
  <br>
  <b>Remembering Babylon</b> by David Malouf (Vintage, 1994). Malouf is an acclaimed Australian novelist and essayist, and his novel deals with the ways in which race happened in Australia--specifically through the eyes of a fictional young white lad who is raised by Aborigines, then seeks to return to "his people." Wonderfully written, thoughtful, and thought-provoking, it's just the thing for summer.<br>
  --Terry Burke, Professor of History<br>
  <br>
  <b>The Romantics</b> by Pankaj Mishra (Random House, 2000). A novel about a poor Brahmin student in Benares who gets entangled in two widely different social worlds: the western expatriate community and Indian student radicals. During this time, the protagonist also attempts to plow his way through the corpus of western literature, and his thoughts on how these people think and act are framed around the writings of Gustave Flaubert and Edmund Wilson.<br>
  --Melanie DuPuis, Assistant Professor of Sociology<br>
  <br>
  <b>The Story of San Michele</b> by Axel Munthe (first published in 1929). A fictional account of the life of a doctor based loosely on the author's own life. Munthe was a very popular doctor at the beginning of the 20th century who worked during the great plague pandemic in Naples, and who eventually built a house (San Michele) in Capri.<br>
  --Giacomo Bernardi, Assistant Professor of Biology<br>
  <br>
  <b>The mystery series by Donna Leon.</b> Her novels take place in Venice, have a very attractive cast of leading characters, and often focus on political issues such as the failure of the Italian government to adequately control the dumping of toxic waste due to vast political corruption. These novels are literate, fun to read, sometimes disturbing--also hard to get in the U.S.<br>
  --Gary Miles, Professor of History<br>
  <br>
  <b>The Catherine LeVendeur series</b> by Sharan Newman (Forge). <i>Death Comes as Epiphany</i> (1993), <i>The Devil's Door</i> (1994), <i>The Wandering Arm</i> (1995), <i>Strong As Death</i> (1996), <i>Cursed in the Blood</i> (1998). The "detective" is Catherine LeVendeur, who starts out as a novice at the convent run by Heloise (of Medieval Abelard and Heloise fame). So far, volumes have to do with Abbot Suger who is building St. Denis (that's a true historical part) and Medieval life in Paris and northern France. I find that they are lots of fun and enjoy a bit of "lite" history, knowing the author isn't distorting, as she is a serious historian.<br>
  --Virginia Jansen, Professor of Art History<br>
  <br>
  <b>Steven Saylor's mystery series</b>. Each book focuses on a real historical event that took place during the late Republic of ancient Rome and follows the main lines of our historical knowledge very closely. These books try to re-create the minds of ancient Romans, to imagine the personal relationships between masters and slaves, between free Roman men and their freedwomen wives, between patrons and clients. I think these books do a good job of putting flesh on the bones of ancient evidence.<br>
  --Gary Miles, Professor of History
</p>
<h2>
  Nonfiction
</h2>
<p>
  <b>Against the Gods, The Remarkable Story of Risk</b> by Peter Bernstein (John Wiley & Sons, 1996). This is an amazing book that ties philosophy, mathematics, religion, investing, and risk assessment all together in a very readable way. It also gives very interesting perspectives on the history of science.<br>
  --Todd Wipke, Professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry<br>
  <br>
  <b>The Clock of the Long Now: Time and Responsibility</b> by Stewart Brand (Basic Books, 1999). Brand writes a proposal for a monumental clock, really a public artwork, that thinks long-term--it strikes once a century--as a way of reshaping ideas of time and responsibility. The book is a series of short essays that expand on this theme. Stewart Brand is a good writer and a visionary thinker.<br>
  --Chip Lord, Professor of Film and Digital Media<br>
  <br>
  <b>The Code Book: The Evolution of Secrecy from Mary, Queen of Scots, to Quantum Cryptography</b> by Simon Singh (Doubleday, 1999). A readable, clear history of codes and ciphers, from ancient days to the WW II Enigma machine (featured in the movie <i>U-571</i>) to the latest in electronic cryptography. Even the nonmathematical will enjoy the stories and the cryptographic challenges in this book.<br>
  --Nirvikar Singh (no relation), Professor of Economics<br>
  <br>
  <b>The Dons: Mentors, Eccentrics, and Geniuses</b> by Noel Annan (University of Chicago Press, 1999). The book offers fascinating portraits of British professors from the Victorian era to the present. The late Noel Annan was a brilliant storyteller as well as a great intellectual historian, and his last book is a pleasure to read.<br>
  --Bruce Thompson, Lecturer in History<br>
  <br>
  <b>Floreana: A Woman's Pilgrimage to the Galapagos</b> by Margret Wittmer (Moyer Bell, 1990). Mrs. Wittmer recounts the story of her life, how she ended up with her husband and son in the 1930s in one of the most remote islands of the Galapagos, living the life of true "natural" people.<br>
  --Giacomo Bernardi, Assistant Professor of Biology<br>
  <br>
  <b>The Greek Achievement: The Foundations of the Western World</b> by Charles Freeman (Viking, 1999). At last there is a really good book on Greek history that is accessible to the nonspecialist, well-written, and very up-to-date in its scholarship. I recommend it highly to anyone who wants a good, readable overview of ancient Greek history.<br>
  --Gary Miles, Professor of History<br>
  <br>
  <b>I Wish I'd Made You Angry Earlier: Essays on Science, Scientists, and Humanity</b> by Max Perutz (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1998). A collection of essays from Nobel Laureate Perutz, exploring a range of topics on both science and his own life, including the story of one woman's love affair with crystals, a man's gruesome fascination with poison gas, his internment in the U.K. as an enemy alien, and his involvement in a plan to create ships out of ice for refueling aircraft in the North Atlantic during WW II.<br>
  --William Scott, Assistant Professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry<br>
  <br>
  <b>Iraq Under Siege: The Deadly Impact of Sanctions and War</b>, edited by Anthony Arnove (South End Press, 2000). A documentation of the impact of a decade of sanctions by the U.S. and the U.K. against Iraq.<br>
  --William Scott, Assistant Professor of Chemistry and Biochemistry<br>
  <br>
  <b>The Legacy of Luna: The Story of a Tree, a Woman, and the Struggle to Save the Redwoods</b> by Julia Butterfly Hill (Harper San Francisco, 2000). This is by and about the woman who sat up in the redwood tree for two years to try to stop some of the clearcutting going on just north of us. I was struck by the power, dedication, and presence of this young woman, which stayed steady through time, through physical harassment, El Nino storms, and international attention. I was also struck by how much effect one dedicated person can have on the course of events. She started with almost no resources beyond a strong desire and religious foundations. It is not particularly well-written, but the story is gripping and quite moving.<br>
  --Richard Montgomery, Associate Professor of Mathematics
</p>
<p>
  <b>The Motorcycle Diaries</b> by Ernesto "Che" Guevara, translated by Ann Wright (Verso Books, 1995). A journal begun in 1951 when Che and a friend traveled around South America on a Norton 500. The motorcycle didn't last very long, but the trip was an important formative experience for the emerging revolutionary. A great biker read with some history and social studies that elevate the book beyond the average.<br>
  --Rick Ortenblad, Lecturer in Theater Arts<br>
  <br>
  <b>Moving Violations: War Zones, Wheelchairs, and Declarations of Independence</b> by John Hockenberry (Hyperion, 1995). Hockenberry is an Emmy-award winning reporter who is confined to a wheelchair. He describes his adventures as a disabled person in a candid tone that is at times hilarious and at other times challenges your ideas of what it means to be disabled.<br>
  --Karen Holl, Assistant Professor of Environmental Studies
</p>
<p>
  <b>My Own Country: A Doctor's Story</b> by Abraham Verghese (Random House/Vintage, 1995). An eloquent memoir by a compassionate doctor about his 1980s AIDS practice in the Smoky Mountains of eastern Tennessee. Born in Ethiopia to expatriate Indian teachers and trained in medicine in India and the U.S., Verghese understands the yearning for a true home, and that understanding becomes central to his doctoring.<br>
  --Sarah Rabkin, Lecturer in Writing and Environmental Studies<br>
  <br>
  <b>The Professor and the Madman</b> by Simon Winchester (Harper Perennial, 1999). A great tale of the making of the first <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> along with murder and insanity.<br>
  --Tricia Sullivan, Lecturer in Linguistics
</p>
<p>
  <b>Ship of Gold in the Deep Blue Sea</b> by Gary Kinder (Atlantic Monthly Press, 1998; Vintage Books, 1999). The story of the shipwreck in 1857 of a sidewheel steamship carrying 21 tons of gold and the salvage effort led in 1989 by Tommy Thompson. I thought it one of best I've read recently, particularly as it describes, in a wonderfully rich context, the kind of scientist/engineer we would naturally encourage amongst our students at UCSC.<br>
  --Peter Scott, Professor Emeritus of Physics
</p>
<p>
  <b>The Spirit Catches You and You Fall Down</b> by Anne Fadiman (Noonday/Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 1997). An evenhanded and fascinating inquiry into the cultural collision that ensues when a Hmong immigrant family in Merced, California, bring their infant daughter to the local hospital for epilepsy treatment.<br>
  --Sarah Rabkin, Lecturer in Writing and Environmental Studies<br>
  <br>
  <b>Wanderlust: A History of Walking</b> by Rebecca Solnit (Viking, 2000). An insightful history full of social insights and analysis of what has been lost with the dominance of the automobile in American life. The last chapter describes a walk from the center of Las Vegas out to the distant foothills.<br>
  --Chip Lord, Professor of Film and Digital Media

        <title>UCSC planning committee will hold community workshop on long-range plans for Long Marine Laboratory property</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_8900" align="alignright" width="240"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/06/lml_aerial.00-06-19.240.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-8900" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/06/lml_aerial.00-06-19.240.jpg" alt="An aerial view of the Long Marine Lab property" width="240" height="189" /></a>An aerial view of the Long Marine Lab property[/caption]
<p>
  UCSC will hold a public workshop on Thursday, June 22, to discuss progress toward developing a Long-Range Master Plan for Long Marine Laboratory and the adjacent 55-acre property purchased last year from Wells Fargo Bank. The meeting will take place in the conference room of the Seymour Center at Long Marine Laboratory from 7 to 9 p.m.
</p>Anyone interested in this topic is urged to attend the workshop and provide input, share information, and ask questions.<br>
<br>
"We are in a very early stage in the planning process, and this workshop is one of many opportunities there will be for public review as we develop a long-range plan," said Charles Eadie, director of campus and community planning.<br>
<br>
A UCSC planning committee, which includes representatives of the city of Santa Cruz, has been working with the city's planning department and the California Coastal Commission since last fall to develop plans for the Long Marine Lab site, including the 55 acres acquired by UCSC in spring of 1999. In December, the committee adopted a set of planning principles for developing the site as a marine research and education center. These principles were presented to the public at an open house in December and published in a document entitled <i>Planning Principles: Marine Research and Education Center.</i><br>
<br>
The university has now selected a consulting team--EHDD Architecture, a San Francisco firm that developed the original Long Marine Lab master plan over 20 years ago and also designed the Monterey Bay Aquarium, and BMS Planning Consultants, also from San Francisco--to prepare a Long-Range Master Plan for the site. The consultants and the planning committee have been meeting with interested parties in a series of focus-group workshops over the past several weeks, Eadie said. Environmental groups, agricultural interests, and the Terrace Point Action Network were among the participants in the focus groups.<br>
<br>
At the public workshop on Thursday, the consultants and the planning committee will present the input they have received from the focus groups, said Gary Griggs, director of UCSC's Institute of Marine Sciences and cochair of the planning committee. In addition, the consultants will present some of their ideas for how the site might be used, Griggs said.<br>
<br>
"There is not yet a plan for the site, and this workshop is an opportunity for interested people to get involved and provide input into the process of developing the plan," Griggs said.<br>
<br>
The <i>Planning Principles</i> document states the university's intention for the property: to create a "world-class" marine research and education center that incorporates Long Marine Laboratory, the lab's Seymour Marine Discovery Center, and the Younger Lagoon Natural Reserve. The document also outlines some broad principles for the site's development and identifies several key issues that will affect planning for the site.<br>
<br>
The planning principles include guidelines regarding protection of the coastal zone environment, maximizing public access to the coast, and minimizing potential conflicts with surrounding land uses and natural resources. Other issues that will affect the site's development include site constraints, the need for open space and buffers, and the need for additional studies concerning roads and parking.<br>
<br>
With respect to housing, the document says some housing on the property will be "critical to the development of a successful marine research and education center." The university is considering housing options that would support the needs of the marine programs on the site, such as accommodations for graduate students, postdoctorates, faculty, and visiting scholars.<br>
<br>
"What we're trying to do is to develop a program that supports the university's needs for marine research and education, and then to get the program to fit on the site in a responsible way," Eadie said.<br>
<br>
After the June 22 workshop, the next step will be for the planning committee to refine the university's ideas for the site to the point where the consulting team can begin to prepare site plans, Eadie said. The consultants will develop more than one set of plans, and the alternatives will be reviewed by the planning committee and eventually presented to the community in another workshop.<br>
<br>
"Ultimately, we will produce a Long-Range Master Plan for the site, which will also serve as a Coastal Long-Range Development Plan to be submitted to the Coastal Commission for approval," Eadie said. "At each stage in the process we will be holding workshops like this to report to the community and to get feedback."

<h4>
  <b><i>Award-winners are nominated by their students</i></b>
</h4>
<p>
  Each year, UC Santa Cruz's Academic Senate honors a number of the campus's most exemplary and inspiring teachers. Thirteen such professors and lecturers have been chosen this year for the 1999-2000 Excellence in Teaching Awards.
</p>The award winners were nominated by students for qualities such as their enthusiasm for teaching, commitment to learning, and the content of their courses.
<p>
  The awards are sponsored by the senate's Committee on Teaching, which evaluated students' nomination letters, endorsement letters from department chairs, and statements on teaching from the nominees themselves in making the award determinations.
</p>
<p>
  Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood and associate professor of linguistics Jaye Padgett, chair of the Committee on Teaching, presented the awards during a year-end ceremony at University House.
</p>
<p>
  Each award winner received a framed certificate and a $500 honorarium.
</p>
<p>
  This year's recipients follow; the wording on their certificates is included in the listing:
</p>

        <title>Two re-entry grads headed for Harvard this fall</title>

[caption id="attachment_8894" align="alignright" width="240"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/06/harvard_stud2.00-06-19.240.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-8894" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/06/harvard_stud2.00-06-19.240.jpg" alt="" width="240" height="175" /></a>[/caption]
<p>
  As the mother of two boys inching up on adulthood, Patricia Boyer knows how hard it is for a parent to impress her teenagers. But when she was accepted into a master's program at Harvard University, Boyer said even her sons had to stand up and cheer.
</p>"They've been supportive from the beginning and continually tell me how proud they are of my returning to school," said Boyer. "When I was accepted to Harvard, it just blew them away. With teenagers, there aren't too many times you can really impress them."<br>
<br>
Boyer is one of two re-entry graduates who are Harvard-bound this fall. Maribel Valencia-Castillo is heading east for a two-year master's program in theological studies. Boyer, who majored in psychology, is enrolling in a one-year master's program in education that focuses on administration, programs, and social policy.<br>
<br>
Boyer transferred to UCSC from a community college in upstate New York in 1997 and discovered a love of research. She hopes to pursue a career in educational policy, with a focus on the unique needs of re-entry students and policy changes that will ensure that all children who have the ability and the desire are prepared to attend college when they graduate from high school.<br>
<br>
"Re-entry students face different issues than 18-year-olds," said Boyer. "Additionally, a large percentage of children never make it to the university. There are many holes in the educational system, and I'd like to be a part of patching a few of those holes. The door to higher education should be open to anybody willing to put forth the effort."<br>
<br>
Boyer worked as a secretary in the main office of a small school district near Ithaca, New York, raising her children as a single parent. She took her first college class in January 1995 at the age of 39. Her boys, now 19 and 20 years old, were in the audience when she graduated from Merrill College on June 10.<br>
<br>
"When I was accepted by UCSC, it meant selling everything that wouldn't fit in my 1986 Cutlass Ciera, loading up the boys, and driving across the country," recalled Boyer. "It was an adventure. Six months later, the car died, but it got us here!"<br>
<br>
Boyer worked closely with psychology professors Catherine Cooper and Margarita Azmitia for two years on a research project exploring the underrepresentation of low-income and ethnic-minority students at the university level. She is particularly grateful to Azmitia, who urged her to write a senior thesis. "I wouldn't have considered doing it, but I'm very glad I did and appreciate Professor Azmitia's support," she said. "I'm proud of completing something I thought was beyond my ability, and I won the dean's award for it."<br>
<br>
As a single parent in college, Boyer has learned to overcome obstacles, and she has made lifelong friends through the Services for Transfer and Re-entry Students (STARS) office. "The re-entry softball team was the highlight of my week," she said, recalling how she would get through stressful weeks by counting the hours until the Friday afternoon games.<br>
<br>
Boyer, 45, jokes about taking classes with "students who could be your kids" and being older than a lot of her professors, but she credits students and faculty with part of her success as a re-entry student. "They have been nothing but supportive," she said. "I was never, never made to feel like I didn't belong."<br>
<br>
Until recently, though, it seemed Boyer had met an obstacle she couldn't overcome: Harvard's tuition, which is more than $23,000 a year. Even with a lot of loans and financial aid, she couldn't make the numbers add up.<br>
<br>
"I was going to frame the letter and tell people how I'd turned down Harvard," said Boyer. "But then I got a call on the first Saturday morning in May at 7:30 from my brother. The family had pulled together some money, and he said 'If you go to Harvard, it's yours.' That was the catch: I had to go to Harvard. It wasn't for anything else."<br>
<br>
After a few tears, Boyer accepted the offer. "It still hasn't completely sunk in," she said. "I appreciate their confidence and support. I just hope one day I can repay their gesture, or help one of their kids go to college."<br>
<br>
For Valencia-Castillo, 28, an undergraduate degree in anthropology follows several years of working in the public health field in California's Central Valley. At Harvard, she will study world religions with an emphasis on understanding how different cultural beliefs affect health care decisions.<br>
<br>
"Religion plays such an important role in most people's lives, and there is a need for understanding people and how they make their decisions about accessing services," she said. "We need to train Western medical doctors about the services provided by local resources, like shamans in the Hmong community in Merced, because they are just as important to the patient."<br>
<br>
Valencia-Castillo worked on HIV-prevention education programs for migrant farmworkers in the Central Valley and then worked specifically with women at risk of HIV. Immediately before enrolling at UCSC, she worked on a three-year project with inmates at the Central California Women's Facility.<br>
<br>
"I was on my way to college when my supervisor asked me to stay because she'd gotten a grant for this project documenting the case-management services HIV-positive women were receiving," said Valencia-Castillo. "I thought I was postponing my undergraduate work for a year, but it turned out to be three years."<br>
<br>
While a student, Valencia-Castillo worked on an ethnographic project on grassroots organizations with a Merced-based agency called Healthy House. Their "Partnership for Health" program further inspired her thoughts about combining theology and public health.<br>
<br>
Valencia-Castillo also had high praise for anthropology professors Olga Najera-Ramirez and Triloki Pandey, and for Bill Dickinson, a UCSC alumnus (Cowell College, 1968) who helped her navigate the Harvard application process. But she said she ended up at UCSC thanks to the efforts of a staff member in the Admissions Office who attended a fair at her local community college.<br>
<br>
"I thought UC wouldn't want any minorities, because it was just after affirmative action was pulled out," she recalled. "But he explained to me that politics is one thing and what the school is trying to do is a different thing."<br>
<br>
Unable to recall his name, Valencia-Castillo nevertheless thanks her anonymous shepherd, who helped guide her on the path to UCSC, and now Harvard.

  Sea otters, semiconductors, climate change, and clock genes were among the topics of research posters presented by UCSC undergraduates at the third annual Undergraduate Research Poster Symposium on Thursday, June 1. About 35 students in the Division of Natural Sciences and the Jack Baskin School of Engineering presented their research at the symposium, held in the Thimann courtyard.
</p>"The undergraduate research experience provides students the rare opportunity to engage in supervised research and learn in a dynamic environment of discovery from professors who are leaders in their fields," said dean of natural sciences David Kliger.<br>
<br>
"We are extremely proud of the student participants and the scholarly work they have undertaken," Kliger said.<br>
<br>
The poster symposium provides students with the experience of presenting their research results in a professional setting. The event was one of many activities held on campus during Student Achievement Week.

        <title>Staff salaries top list of concerns at lunch meeting with Greenwood</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 19 Jun 2000 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  Increasing staff salaries is among the "top priorities" for the University of California in the coming year, Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood told a gathering of about 200 people during her third brown-bag lunch of the year with staff. "We are collecting comparative salary data, and the Office of the President is doing it, too, so that we will be able to present a compelling case about these lags in UC staff salaries," said Greenwood, acknowledging that there is a problem and the administration needs to develop a plan to address it. "We need this information to be able to get the political support to move forward." Preliminary research has identified lags of 4.5 percent to 10 percent in UCSC staff salaries when compared to similar private-sector jobs in Monterey and Santa Cruz Counties. Salary data for nonprofit and public-sector employers is "tough to get," but the effort to gather it continues, said Greenwood. For some jobs, staff salaries at UCSC are lagging up to 30 percent behind salaries paid for comparable jobs in the San Francisco Bay Area, according to Greenwood. There is considerable variability in job classifications and ranges in both the San Francisco Bay Area and in Santa Clara County, but the salary gap was persistent. Compared with other UC campuses in northern California, salaries at UCSC are "somewhat lower" in some categories but not in others, said Greenwood, noting that differences were of "a couple hundred dollars." "It is not as big a discrepancy, as I understand it, as some rumors would have it," she said. "But on average, our salaries appear to be somewhat lower." Greenwood told those in attendance that the administration will respond to the problem, but noted that, "It will take some time before we have a good explanation for you of how we are planning to address the lag in your particular job category." Depending on developments in Sacramento, Greenwood announced that UC staff appear to be in line to receive 4 percent cost-of-living adjustments and 1.5 percent merit increases, but she noted that any increase for represented employees is subject to bargaining negotiations. "That's a pretty decent increase compared to where we were in the fall," she said, referring to the early stages of budget negotiations. Julia Armstrong-Zwart noted that human resources has expanded salary ranges from 50 percent to 80 percent for some classifications, but she emphasized that the challenge remains for managers to find the money to actually fund the higher ranges. "I'm not trying to pretend that expanding the ranges solves the salary problem," she said. Following up on a topic raised at a previous meeting, Armstrong-Zwart clarified that more than half of the 287 reclasses approved last year were for clerical employees, 5 percent of whom were promoted out of the clerical bargaining unit. "That means that more than 20 percent of clerical employees on campus were reclassed last year," she added. Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor John Simpson reiterated that he has instructed deans, vice chancellors, and unit managers to include "staffing plans" in budget proposals submitted to his office. One idea the campus is exploring with members of the Santa Cruz City Council is a collaborative effort to build subsidized housing that would be "appropriate for staff, and some new faculty perhaps, and graduate students," said Greenwood. Administrators also intend to include staff housing in development proposals for the north end of campus, but occupancy is "five or six years" off, she said. On other topics, Greenwood endorsed plans to draft a campus "civility statement" and said she has received a proposal from human resources and the Academic Senate Committee on Faculty Welfare to appoint a committee of faculty and staff to look at "work/life" issues on campus, including child care resources and physical fitness facilities. "One charge of that committee will be to develop a civility statement," said Greenwood. "We have to return to a place where people are unfailingly civil to each other." On the fitness front, the East Field House hours have been expanded, with the facility now open to staff at 6 a.m., said Dan Wood, director of physical education, recreation, and sports, who noted that expanding offerings at the West Field House is more problematic but is still under consideration. Administrators also touted the success of the new bicycle shuttle system, which is transporting about 50 bikes a day, according to TAPS director Wes Scott. "I won't be satisfied until we reach 300 a day," he said.

  Martha Mendoza, a 1988 graduate of UCSC (Kresge College) who received a Pulitzer Prize for investigative journalism this spring, was honored at a June 6 reception at University House. Mendoza was part of an Associated Press team that documented the killing of hundreds of civilians by U.S. troops during the early weeks of the Korean War.

  An article in <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/email/cen/html/053100174848.html"><i>Chemical and Engineering News</i></a> featured the research of professor of chemistry and biochemistry <b>Glenn Millhauser.</b> Millhauser and his coworkers are using a technique called electron spin resonance to study protein structures. <b><br>
  <br>
  Karl Gebhardt,</b> a Hubble postdoctoral fellow in the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, was quoted in an article in the <i>New York Times</i> about research on supermassive black holes in the centers of galaxies conducted by Gebhardt and an international team of collaborators.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Patricia Zavella</b> of community studies was quoted in an article in the <i>Arizona Republic</i> on machismo and Latino culture. The article was reprinted in the <i>Mexico City News.</i>
</p>

<p>
  Research astronomer and operations manager at Lick Observatory <b>Remington Stone</b> appeared on KNAX's <i>Good Morning Sacramento,</i> the top-rated morning television show in the Sacramento area. The show did a live broadcast from Lick Observatory in May, and Stone served as the gracious host.
</p>

<p>
  A final project in an art class taught by <b>Nobuho Nagasawa</b> turned into a memorable <i>Good Times</i> cover June 8. The cover story, about Y2K graduates, was illustrated by an image of five students walking off into a grassy meadow, carrying tool boxes and wearing short-sleeved blue workshirts. The props were part of the students' final project, for which they each designed individual artworks to give to their classmates and Nagasawa. The toolboxes were a gift from Nagasawa. The students pictured were <b>Peter Hokama, Virgina Kleker, Sean Horchy, Amy Bunker, and Holly Chang Gummelt.</b><br>
  <br>
  A front-page story in the <i>Santa Cruz Sentinel</i> on the Center for Adaptive Optics featured <b>Jerry Nelson,</b> professor of astronomy and astrophysics and director of the center, <b>Sandra Faber,</b> University Professor of astronomy and astrophysics, and <b>Anthony Misch,</b> a specialist at Lick Observatory.

        <title>New video examines impact of computers on human interaction</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_8879" align="alignright" width="220"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/06/lord_chip.00-06-19.220.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-8879" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/06/lord_chip.00-06-19.220.jpg" alt="Chip Lord" width="220" height="280" /></a>Chip Lord[/caption]
<p>
  Through the advent of the web, we can get whatever we want online--groceries, prescriptions, even pets. We can bank online, make friends online, even attend virtual concerts and art shows online. One man in Dallas, who calls himself <a href="http://www.dotcomguy.com">DotComGuy</a>, has even gone so far as to confine himself to his home for a full year, acquiring everything he needs (including a Valentine's Day date) through the web.
</p>Observing the increasing "realness" of virtual reality, UCSC film professor Chip Lord has produced a video that explores the question of how the computer is affecting the ways we interact with each other and our environment. The video, <i>Awakening from the Twentieth Century,</i> aired recently on public television and is the winner of the Dallas Video Festival's Latham Award for 1999. <b><br>
<br></b>"I started working on this during a sabbatical in early 1998," Lord says. "I wanted to look at how the computer is changing the ways in which we conduct daily life. One of my central goals was to find out whether the Internet and virtual networking--telecommuting, distance learning, e-commerce--have had an effect on how we use our physical space."<br>
<br>
To explore this, Lord combines montages of life in San Francisco with interviews. Among those he interviews are Homer Flynn, spokesperson for a San Francisco underground, multimedia band named <a href="http://www.residents.com">The Residents</a>; <a href="http://www.lafong.com/lafong/sanbornbio.html">John Sanborn</a>, director of the online rock and roll murder mystery "Paul Is Dead"; Ellen Ullman, a software engineer, commentator, and author of <i>Close to the Machine;</i> Gannon Hall, a web site designer; and Rebecca Solnit, a social commentator and author of the just-published book, <i>Wanderlust: A History of Walking</i> (Viking Press)<i>.<br>
<br></i>Rather than aim to prove a point, Lord is out to explore the implications of our emerging computer-generated culture. One montage opens with a view of the old-fashioned marble-floored interior of a Wells Fargo Bank branch bank in San Francisco and fades to a nearby Safeway, in which a Wells Fargo "mini-bank" is built into the wall. The juxtaposition continues with a shot of a billboard advertising the bank's dramatic picture of racing horses pulling a stagecoach and, over that image, in stark white, the URL "www.wellsfargo.com."<br>
<br>
"Is the physical space of the bank becoming obsolete?" Lord asks.<br>
<br>
Through his interviews Lord also explores the impending fate of such things as the automobile, film, community. But the question that most concerns Lord is whether the physical space of the city itself is becoming obsolete.<br>
<br>
Lord gets very different opinions from his subjects. Web designer and computing specialist <a href="http://www.hallconsulting.com">Gannon Hall</a> conducts most of his business virtually--through e-mail, web sites, and the phone. "Gannon recognizes that an initial face-to-face meeting with clients is necessary, but once he starts working on a project he does everything virtually, via the Internet. For Gannon, because his business is virtual, he could be anywhere. He doesn't need the city. To him, the city is like fashion. You choose it the same way you would choose clothes. He says, 'you wear the city.' "<br>
<br>
But social commentator Rebecca Solnit feels very differently, affirming the importance of real-life interaction at such places as the Farmer's Market, where vendors and customers interact directly and chance encounters with friends can take place. To flesh out this perspective, Lord also shows footage of two groups of San Franciscans--bicyclists and rollerbladers. The bicycling event, called Critical Mass, is anything but virtual, drawing some 3,000 bicyclists each month who hit the streets during a Friday rush hour.<br>
<br>
As Lord trails along with the rollerbladers, hundreds of whom come out each Friday for the "Friday Night Skate," he comes to this conclusion:<br>
<br>
"Maybe because of the utopian images we hear about the new technologies, I thought that broadcasting, netcasting, wireless networks, and pagers, cellphones, and beepers all were conspiring to end the need for public gathering--for celebration and the ritual rubbing of shoulders in streets, plazas, and squares. But I was wrong. Because we still need fashion. We still need to wear the city because the city is..." Lord trails off, letting Humphrey Bogart, in the character of San Francisco detective Sam Spade, finish his sentence: "The stuff that dreams are made of."<br>

        <title>Economist David Kaun gives $50,000 to fund graduate student awards</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_8877" align="alignright" width="220"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/06/kaun_students.00-06-19.220.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-8877" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/06/kaun_students.00-06-19.220.jpg" alt="David Kaun, flanked by Matt McGinty (left) and Garrett Milam (Photo: Jennifer McNulty)" width="220" height="156" /></a>David Kaun, flanked by Matt McGinty (left) and Garrett Milam (Photo: Jennifer McNulty)[/caption]
<p>
  David Kaun, a professor of economics at UCSC, has worked with some very good graduate students over the years. But he was so impressed by two talented teaching assistants last fall that he has given the campus $50,000 to establish a new annual award that will recognize outstanding teaching by graduate students.
</p>Two graduate student recipients of the new Milam-McGinty-Kaun Award will be named each year, one from the Economics Department and one from another department in the Division of Social Sciences. Each will receive a $1,000 award. The award is named after its first recipients, Garrett Milam and Matt McGinty, who are in UCSC's doctoral program in international economics. Milam and McGinty were teaching assistants last fall in Kaun's <i>Intermediate Microeconomic Theory</i> course, which had an enrollment of about 120 undergraduates.<br>
<br>
"It was a tough course--tough for me because I hadn't taught it in a long time, and tough for the students because of the material," recalled Kaun, crediting Milam and McGinty with making major contributions to the success of the course and inspiring him to establish the endowment. "These two wonderful young men were phenomenal in every dimension. They were so good, I just wanted to acknowledge that kind of teaching assistance."<br>
<br>
Milam and McGinty, who worked together as teaching assistants in the same course during their first quarter on campus, have each been teaching assistants in numerous courses since they arrived at UCSC in 1996. Good friends, they both "actually enjoy teaching," said Milam, who plans to become a university professor of economics.<br>
<br>
"This is what I've wanted to do since my second year of college," said Milam.<br>
<br>
McGinty's memories of his undergraduate days at Michigan State University inspire him in the classroom. "I had some experiences with bad TAs and never wanted to be one," said McGinty, describing the satisfaction he gets from helping students understand difficult and complex economic concepts.<br>
<br>
"It's a challenge for me to try to make sure the top of the class isn't bored and the bottom isn't left behind," he added. "My goal is inclusiveness. I want all of the students to feel like the class is worth their time."<br>
<br>
The course focused on the principles of microeconomics, which Kaun described as the "heart and soul" of economics. The field looks at individuals in three roles--as consumers, workers, and the owners of organizations--to understand and attempt to predict their behavior in economic settings.<br>
<br>
McGinty joked that dedicated graduate students represent a failing of economists' ability to predict human behavior, because they work hard despite marginal incentives and rewards. "I'd like to thank David for providing this incentive for teaching well," McGinty said upon receiving the award. "As graduate students, there are lots of reasons not to devote time to teaching, including your own studies, but to be a good TA, you have to care about your students."<br>
<br>
The gift is not Kaun's first. He has established a $100,000 music scholarship that will, when it is fully funded, provide full support for a clarinet player. "The arts, and music in particular, have always been my first love," said Kaun, who hopes his gifts move others to give generously. "Andrew Carnegie once said there are only three things to do with your money, and two of them are rather stupid. He said you can leave it for the government to tax away, you can leave it to your children, or you can spend it wisely in ways you think are appropriate. For me, these contributions to the university are a wise thing to do, and fun as well."<br>
<br>
Graduate students in anthropology, economics, education, environmental studies, politics, psychology, and sociology will be eligible for future awards.

        <title>Academic Senate honors Professor Emeritus Joseph Bunnett with the Dean McHenry Award for Distinguished Leadership</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_8874" align="alignright" width="250"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/06/bunnett_joseph.00-06-19.250.gif"><img class="size-full wp-image-8874" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/06/bunnett_joseph.00-06-19.250.gif" alt="Joseph Bunnett" width="250" height="359" /></a>Joseph Bunnett[/caption]
<p>
  At its June 1 meeting, the Academic Senate honored Joseph Bunnett, professor emeritus of chemistry and biochemistry, with the Dean McHenry Award for Distinguished Leadership in the Academic Senate. In conjunction with this award, Bunnett was also nominated for the UC-systemwide Oliver Johnson Award for Distinguished Leadership in the Academic Senate.
</p>Bunnett was a founding member of the UCSC campus, arriving in 1966 and serving as chair of the Chemistry Department. In selecting Bunnett for the Dean McHenry Award, a senate committee noted that he had succeeded brilliantly in areas crucial to the establishment of a new campus: department-building, teaching and related concerns with undergraduates, prominence in his profession, and service to the Academic Senate and the larger community.<br>
<br>
The committee wrote that "Bunnett has been a driving force in the invention of the Santa Cruz campus. Much of his influence in shaping our campus institutions has been exercised through his Senate service. With his deep knowledge of the bylaws and parliamentary procedure he has enhanced the effectiveness of the Santa Cruz Senate and encouraged a generation of faculty to participate in the work of the Academic Senate."<br>
<br>
Bunnett began senate service the year after he arrived. He has served as chair of the Academic Senate and several times as its parliamentarian. He also chaired two of the senate's most important committees: Academic Personnel and Faculty Welfare. He has been a member of many of the other major committees, including Rules, Jurisdictions and Elections, Planning and Budget, Privilege and Tenure, and the Committee on Committees.<br>
<br>
Bunnett is a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and has received numerous awards in recognition of his research accomplishments. Most recently, he was awarded the James Flack Norris Award in Physical Organic Chemistry (1992), one of the highest honors a physical organic chemist can receive from the American Chemical Society.<br>
<br>
Early in his career at UCSC, Bunnett was a founding editor of <i>Accounts of Chemical Research,</i> a major journal of the American Chemical Society, and he held the position as editor in chief for over 20 years.<br>
<br>
Bunnett retired in 1991, but he continues an active program of research. He<br>
also assumed additional responsibilities when he retired, serving as chair of the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemists (IUPAC) Task Force on Scientific Aspects of the Destruction of Chemical Warfare Agents. In 1995, he became, and continues to serve as, chairman of the corresponding IUPAC Committee on Chemical Weapons Destruction. Meanwhile, he continued to serve the Academic Senate faculty as chair of the Committee on Emeriti Relations until this year.

        <title>Grad student Scott Shaffer wins Ocean Sciences Outstanding Student Achievement Award for 1999-2000</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  The Ocean Sciences Department has awarded the 1999-2000 Ocean Sciences Outstanding Student Achievement Award to graduate student Scott Shaffer. The award recognizes overall scientific excellence, achievement, and promise coupled with outstanding service to the scientific and public communities. The $100 award is made possible by the generosity of anonymous donors. Shaffer received his Ph.D. in biology this year, just three years after completing his M.S. degree in marine sciences. Professor of biology Daniel Costa and associate professor of biology Terrie Williams served as his coadvisers for both degrees. "[Shaffer] has been an excellent student, an outstanding citizen, and has tremendous potential as an academic and representative of UCSC," Costa said. "He is without question one of the finest students to come out of my laboratory." Shaffer's research for his master's thesis examined the diving behavior of beluga whales. His thesis was published in and made the cover of the <i>Journal of Experimental Biology</i> in December 1997. For his Ph.D. thesis, Shaffer studied the physiology of flight in two species of albatross. Both of these projects involved collaborations with other institutions: The beluga whale research was carried out at the U.S. Navy research laboratory in San Diego, and the albatross studies at two French Antarctic stations in collaboration with the French Antarctic Research Program. In both cases, according to Costa, Shaffer served as a superb ambassador for UCSC's programs, impressing his collaborators and paving the way for other UCSC students to work with these institutions. Shaffer has presented his research at various scientific meetings and recently received the award for "Best Student Paper" at the Pacific Seabird Group meeting in February. He has also given public lectures, most recently to the Northern California Chapter of the Audubon Society. Shaffer also serves as a graduate student representative to the Chancellor's Animal Research Committee. In addition to his considerable skills as a researcher, Shaffer is an accomplished teacher. He was the senior teaching assistant in Costa's Marine Mammal Biology class and was responsible for creating several new laboratory sections for that course. He also gave several lectures to the class and will be teaching <i>Marine Mammal Biology</i> this summer.

  <font color="#003399">Mark Franko</font>
</h4>

<p>
  Professor of theater arts <a href="http://arts.ucsc.edu/faculty/Franko/index.html">Mark Franko</a> choreographed and directed a production of Monteverdi's dramatic madrigals "Ballo delle Ingrate" and "Combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda," a collaboration between his company NovAntiqua and Magnificat, an early music group from the Bay Area. Franko also danced the title role of Tancredi in performances of the madrigal staged at Berkeley, Palo Alto, and San Francisco.
</p>

<p>
  In early June, Franko presented a paper titled "Sanasardo/Feuer: Une Lecon de Danse" at a conference on contemporary dance held in Fontvieille, France. While in France, he also gave a talk on the development of dance studies and his own work at the Dance Department of the <a href="http://www.univ-paris8.fr/">University of Paris VIII,</a> where he will be a visiting professor in spring 2001.

<p>
  If the thought of sweet, flavorful strawberries brings a smile to your face, mark your calendar for Tuesday, June 6, because that's the day the popular campus market cart opens.
</p>Enjoy the bounty of the UCSC Farm & Garden by shopping at the market cart, which is located at the main entrance of campus. The cart features picked-that-morning fruit, vegetables, and flowers. It will be open each Tuesday and Friday afternoon from noon until 6 p.m. in front of the Barn Theater at the intersection of Bay and High Streets.<br>
<br>
As always, the cart will offer colorful bouquets, featuring sweet peas, sunflowers, larkspur, alstroemeria, snapdragons, bachelor's buttons, feverfew, and more. The array of fresh organic fruits and vegetables grows as the season progresses, but early offerings include gourmet salad mix, tender lettuces, kiwis, beets, spinach, chard, kale, and green garlic. As summer unfolds, watch for potatoes, sweet corn, flavorful dry-farmed tomatoes, an array of sweet and hot peppers, apples, basil, and more.<br>
<br>
The cart will be open through the summer and into the fall, depending on the length of the growing season. All proceeds benefit the UCSC Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems' apprenticeship program in ecological horticulture. For more information, call (831) 459-3248.

  Special meals, fly-fishing adventures, and Hawaiian vacations are among the items to be auctioned off at Long Marine Lab's 15th annual Whale of an Auction. Enjoy a catered buffet and sample fine wines, champagne, and caviar while bidding on a grand array of offerings available nowhere else. The fun begins at 6 p.m. in the Porter College Dining Hall on Friday, June 16. All proceeds support the public education programs at the Seymour Center at Long Marine Laboratory. The auction items donated so far include wetsuits, fine wines, natural history tours, a private sail for 40 on the Team O'Neill catamaran, a romantic stay at La Casa de Espiritus Alegres in Mexico, and a VIP birthday party at Long Marine Lab's new Seymour Marine Discovery Center. Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood is offering a private dinner for 12 at University House. Also up for bid will be special behind-the-scenes tours of the Monterey Bay Aquarium, Sea World, Ano Nuevo State Reserve, and the Seymour Center. The annual event, sponsored by the Friends of Long Marine Lab, raises tens of thousands of dollars for the lab's efforts to inform schoolchildren and the general public about the Monterey Bay marine environment and marine research at UCSC. The Seymour Center at Long Marine Lab is dedicated to educating people about the role scientific research plays in the understanding and conservation of the world's oceans.

<p>
  A discussion of UCSC's Narrative Evaluation System, which had been scheduled to take place at a meeting of the Academic Senate on Wednesday, May 31, was postponed after a student protest blocked the entrances to the meeting hall.
</p>Assembled in the entry way to Classroom Unit 2 and in the walkway in front of the building, the students--numbering approximately 200--demanded the "creation of an advisory group on student-faculty relations" that would foster communication over issues like how student performance is assessed.
<p>
  After senate leaders, senior administrators, and representatives of the protesting students discussed the demands in a nearby office for 20 minutes, senate chair Roger Anderson emerged to announce that he was cancelling the senate meeting. "Student demands...cannot be resolved in a timely manner that will enable the meeting to take place today," Anderson said.
</p>
<p>
  Anderson, meanwhile, scheduled an emergency senate meeting for Thursday, June 1, at 3:30 p.m. at Kresge Town Hall. He and other senate leaders said the Narrative Evaluation System (NES) would not be on the agenda, but that several important year-end matters would be, including the assignment of committee positions, the reappointment of a committee assessing "merit equity" among faculty, and the affirmation of the annual faculty research lecturer.
</p>
<p>
  With the spring-quarter winding down, Wednesday's protest effectively delays the discussion of NES reform until the fall quarter, Anderson said. Scheduled to be discussed at the meeting was a proposal by the senate's Committee on Educational Policy that would have continued the requirement that instructors provide narratives in all upper-division courses. CEP's proposal, however, leaves any requirement for narratives in lower-division courses up to individual departments, a departure from current policy. The proposal would apply to entering undergraduates in fall 2001 and to all undergraduates after spring 2004.
</p>
<p>
  The protest also left unclear the status of the senate's recent "mail ballot" vote on grades. In an e-mail message to senators last week, Anderson acknowledged that there was a "possible discrepancy" between the language of the mail ballot and that contained in the draft minutes from the February 23 senate meeting. "Until the February 23 minutes are approved by the senate, either corrected or as written, the validity of the mail ballot cannot be determined," Anderson said in the message.
</p>
<p>
  In the grading legislation that is the subject of the mail ballot, students entering in fall 2001 would continue to be able to take courses on a Pass/No Pass (P/NP) basis. But no more than 25 percent of the UCSC course work applied toward graduation credit could be taken on a P/NP basis.
</p>
<p>
  The mail ballot was requested by 27 senators following the February 23 meeting. At that meeting, the senate voted overwhelmingly (154-77) for the grading legislation. With Wednesday's meeting cancelled and the mail ballots collected but uncounted, Anderson said the February vote remains the decision of record.

        <title>Accountability is key element of new higher education partnership</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 29 May 2000 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>8849</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  <a href="mailto:XX@cats.ucsc.edu"><br></a>UC Office of the President Gov. Gray Davis, the University of California and the California State University have reached agreement on a new partnership that will provide for continued investment and accountability in California higher education during the coming years. The partnership, a set of agreements between the Davis administration and the two institutions, provides for predictable annual increases in General Fund support for UC and CSU while also committing both systems to accountability in specific areas of performance. It takes effect immediately and will last at least through 2002-03. "This partnership is a strong statement of the state's commitment to quality, access, affordability and accountability in California higher education," said UC President Richard C. Atkinson. "It is a plan that will greatly help UC meet its obligations to the tens of thousands of new students who will be knocking at our doors in the coming years." The Davis administration announced the partnership in a letter to the chairs of the Legislature's budget committees during the week of May 15-19. The partnership aims to provide UC with growing financial resources in the coming years to help the university plan for the future, invest in core needs, and provide access to an affordable, high-quality education for the 60,000 additional students expected to enroll at UC by 2010. The partnership also includes UC commitments to timely graduation, increased transfers from community colleges, expanded teacher training, continued collaboration with K-12 schools and other objectives important to the state. The Legislature will still review UC's budget annually. With the partnership, however, the Davis administration signals its intention to provide UC with a predictable 4 percent increase of state General Fund money each year, plus funding for enrollment growth. In addition, UC would receive a 1 percent increase dedicated to building maintenance, instructional equipment, instructional technology and libraries--areas in which funding backlogs exist--and would receive additional one-time funding for these priorities when fiscal conditions permit. The partnership also would make funding available for annuitant benefits; for debt service related to capital outlay; and for new or expanded initiatives such as the development of off-campus centers, year-round operations, increased outreach to K-12 schools, or special research initiatives. The partnership includes $210 million per year for UC facilities needs, consistent with voter-approved Proposition 1A, and support for new capital funding after Proposition 1A expires in 2001-02, through either a new bond or other state funds. Additionally, the partnership calls for mandatory systemwide student fees to rise each year by no more than the increase in California per-capita personal income. The governor and the Legislature would have the option of "buying out" fee increases, as they have in recent years, by providing equivalent General Fund money. The 1999-2000 year is the fifth consecutive year without a mandatory systemwide fee increase at UC, and these fees actually have decreased 10 percent for resident undergraduates and 5 percent for resident academic graduate students. In return for the state's funding commitments, UC commits to accountability on a number of key objectives, such as ensuring student access to the university under the state Master Plan for Higher Education, maintaining faculty teaching loads that provide students with the classes they need for timely graduation, preserving competitive faculty salaries, and more than doubling the number of teachers trained at UC by 2002-03. The agreement also calls for UC to continue expanding outreach programs to improve the academic performance of K-12 students, increase the number of transfer students from community colleges, increase regional collaborations with the other segments of public higher education, maximize use of its facilities, continue pursuing development of UC Merced, and continue graduating students who will meet California's workforce needs, through means including an expansion of enrollments in engineering and computer science. The university also will increase its research efforts to help California remain competitive in the knowledge-based economy, including creation of the California Institutes for Science and Innovation and expansion of the Industry-University Cooperative Research Program. Also, the partnership calls for UC to create $50 million in internal budget savings by 2002-03 from increased use of technology and streamlining of administrative practices. Those funds would be redirected to the chronically underfunded areas of building maintenance, instructional equipment, instructional technology and libraries--purposes for which the state would increase permanent funding by $100 million between 1999-2000 and 2002-03. "We look forward to meeting our obligations under this partnership to maintain high-quality academic programs, to expand educational opportunity and to help California remain competitive in the global economy," Atkinson said. "This agreement establishes benchmarks, for both the state and the university, that will help us plan wisely for the future." The new partnership builds on the success of a similar four-year agreement between the two university systems and former Gov. Pete Wilson. That "compact," instituted in 1995, helped stabilize funding for California higher education following the recession of the early 1990s. Both the state and the university systems more than met their commitments under the compact.

        <title>A message concerning the senate's 'mail ballot'</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  The following message was distributed to members of UCSC's Academic Senate on Friday, May 26, by senate chair Roger Anderson. The message includes an announcement by the senate's Committee on Rules, Jurisdiction, and Elections, which has been evaluating the validity of a "mail ballot" distributed to senate members. The mail ballot followed a vote on UCSC's grading policy that took place at the senate's regularly scheduled meeting in February.
</p>

<p><hr>
<p>
  <b>TO:</b> All Faculty<br>
  <b>FROM:</b> Roger Anderson, Chair<br>
  <b>RE:</b> Announcement from Committee on Rules, Jurisdiction and Elections (RJ&E)
</p>
<p>
  I know that all of you are very interested in the RJ&E deliberations. The announcement and explaination enclosed (below) from RJ&E regarding the mail ballot is for your information, but these items are not a ruling or finding. The legislation appearing on the mail ballot was written several weeks before the draft minutes of the February 23, 2000 meeting were available. As a consequence, there is a possible discrepancy between the mail ballot legislation and the legislation actually passed on February 23.
</p>
<p>
  Until the February 23, 2000 minutes are approved by the Senate, either corrected or as written, the validity of the mail ballot cannot be determined. The transcripts from the meeting are unclear in parts and subject to interpretation. Many senators who attended the meeting have very different interpretations of the meaning of the amendment (#2 on page 8 of the May meeting CALL) passed at the meeting. Several corrections to the minutes have already been submitted. It is for the Senate to come together on Wednesday, May 31, and approve minutes that accurately reflect what occurred at the meeting.
</p>
<p>
  We have a very full agenda for Wednesday's meeting. If we are unable to complete our business on May 31st, we have reserved Kresge Town Hall for the following day, 2:00 pm on Thursday, June 1st.
</p>
<p>
  Sincerely,<br>
  Roger Anderson, Chair<br>
  Academic Senate<br>
  Santa Cruz Division
</p>
<hr>
<p>
  <b>TO ALL MEMBERS OF THE ACADEMIC SENATE:</b><br>
  ANNOUNCEMENT REGARDING THE MAIL BALLOT ON MANDATORY GRADING
</p>
<p>
  After the mail ballot on mandatory grading was sent to the members of the Academic Senate, it was noted that there were differences between the printed language in the mail ballot and the language on the grading legislation [regulations] as passed according to the minutes of the February 23, 2000 Senate meeting. These differences raised questions about the certifiability of the ballot, and whether the changes were slight or substantive. If the changes were judged to be substantive, the ballot could not be certified and a new one would need to be held.
</p>
<p>
  After a good deal of effort, consternation, and consultation between RJ&E and Senate leadership about possible methods of avoiding a new mail ballot, the Senate Chair suggested that a call to the Chair of UC R&J would be in order, and the members of SC RJ&E concurred. Everyone involved wished to learn whether a new mail ballot could be avoided and the present one certified without generating endless problems, complications, and a high probability of reversal were the outcome to be appealed to UCR&J.
</p>
<p>
  Several alternatives were proposed to the Chair of UC R&J. He advised that, while the language of the legislation passed at the Senate meeting was permissible, the changes appearing in the mail ballot were substantive. Moreover, he knew of no known legally-available alternative methods to certify the ballot. As per the above, and the fact that there is an outstanding petition for a mail referendum which has neither been satisfied nor withdrawn by the petitioners, we have informed the Chair and the Secretary of the Academic Senate that the ballot must be judged invalid. Given the the rapidly-approaching end of the Spring Quarter, and the requirement that any ballot must be conducted with at least ten days of instruction remaining, it will be necessary to postpone any new ballot until Fall Quarter, 2000
</p>
<p>
  The ballots are and will remain unopened and in the possession of the Secretary until a decision is made as to their disposition.
</p>
<p>
  We were also advised by the Chair of UC R&J to make this announcement.
</p>
<p>
  It has also been decided that all communications from the committee to the Senate Membership as a body be in writing.
</p>
<p>
  The Committee on Rules, Jurisdiction and Elections
</p>
<hr>
<p>
  <b>TO THE MEMBERSHIP OF THE ACADEMIC SENATE:</b><br>
  EXPLANATION OF THE MAIL BALLOT PROBLEM
</p>
<p>
  The following text, taken from the call for the February 23, 2000 Senate meeting, is section 9.1.2 in the legislation [grading regulations, SCR's, CEP Substitute amendment, AS/SCP/1258 [in the call for same and at <a href="http://senate.ucsc.edu./cep/scp1258.html">http://senate.ucsc.edu./cep/scp1258.html</a>]

  (NEW)<br>
  9.1.2 A Pass/Not passed option is available to a student in good standing in the manner provided for by SR 782. A grade of Passed shall be awarded only for work which would otherwise receive a grade of C or better. A department may require that any course or courses applied toward credit in a major be taken on a letter grade basis. The P/NP option must be exercised no later than the last day to add a course and may not be subsequently changed.
</p>
<p>
  At the February 23 Senate meeting, an amendment was proposed to this legislation: "For courses taken on a Pass/No Pass basis, a passing grade will be at least at the level of C minus." [See the minutes at <a href="http://senate.ucsc.edu./call/00feb/00febmd.html">http://senate.ucsc.edu./call/00feb/00febmd.html</a>]. The amendment was passed and, with this single amendment, the legislation was passed as above.
</p>
<p>
  The only change thereby made, actually and literally, in the legislation [SCR's] as passed was the substitution of the term "C-" for the term "C" in section 9.1.2. As passed by the Senate, section 9.1.2 now reads as follows:
</p>
<p>
  (NEW, as amended)<br>
  9.1.2 A Pass/Not passed option is available to a student in good standing in the manner provided for by SR 782. A grade of Passed shall be awarded only for work which would otherwise receive a grade of C- or better. A department may require that any course or courses applied toward credit in a major be taken on a letter grade basis. The P/NP option must be exercised no later than the last day to add a course and may not be subsequently changed.
</p>
<p>
  All other sections of the proposed legislation were passed without change [as per the minutes, the transcript, and the other confirming factual information received as to what the amendment actually (and literally) was].
</p>
<p>
  No other sections of the proposed legislation [including (SCR's) 9.1.8, 9.4.1.F, 10.1.2, 10.2.2.1, and 10.4.7] were amended during the February 23 Senate Meeting. The mail ballot did, however, include difference involving these sections. Consequently, the changes were judged to have been substantive [not editorial or typographical] and not voted on at the Divisional Senate Meeting. Please note that it is not the intent of the proposer but the amendment as actually (and literally) proposed and passed that is relevant.
</p>
<p>
  Therefore, the ballot was judged to be uncertifiable.[The mail ballot language can be found at: <a href="http://senate.ucsc.edu./Mailball/Grading/grdregs.html">http://senate.ucsc.edu./Mailball/Grading/grdregs.html</a>]
</p>
<p>
  Advice was also received from UC R&J that an explanation of this problem should be given as part of any new mail ballot.

  <b>Arts & Lectures'</b> presentation of Wynton Marsalis and the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra was covered locally--in the <i>Santa Cruz County Sentinel,</i> regionally--in the <i>San Jose Mercury News,</i> and nationally--in the <i>New York Times.</i> The <i>Times</i> article noted that sunbathers on Cowell Beach (below the WestCoast Santa Cruz Hotel where the band stayed) got a pleasant earful when some band members stepped out onto their balconies and jammed before the show. UC Santa Cruz Foundation trustee <b>Yolanda Dybdahl</b> was quoted for the story.
</p>

<p>
  The <i>Miami Herald</i> led an in-depth story about changes in Latin American studies with a quote from <b>Jonathan Fox</b> of our own LALS program.
</p>

<p>
  Physics professor <b>Zack Schlesinger</b> penned an op-ed about narrative evaluations for the <i>San Jose Mercury News.</i> <b>Manuel Pastor</b> appeared on the same pages discussing the origins of the digital divide, which he believes is rooted in "the divide in the digital economy."
</p>

<p>
  The <i>Sacramento Bee</i> publicized the new California State Summer School in Mathematics and Science, dubbed <b>COSMOS</b>, in its pages recently. The four-week program caters to the interests of the state's top high school students in math and science.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Lora Lee Martin,</b> director of the Monterey Bay Education, Science and Technology (MBEST) Center, was quoted in an article in the <i>Monterey County Herald</i> about recent progress in developing UCSC's site on the former Fort Ord military base. A new road and infrastructure now under construction will soon open up 67 acres for development at the research and technology center, and construction of the UC MBEST Center headquarters and small-business incubator building is scheduled to begin this summer.<br>

        <title>With new high-speed link, UC astronomers won't have to travel to Hawaii to use the Keck Telescopes</title>

<p>
  A remote observing facility nearing completion at UCSC will enable astronomers to operate the powerful Keck Telescopes atop Mauna Kea in Hawaii without leaving the mainland.
</p>The new facility will be especially useful for astronomers conducting short observing runs, said Joseph Miller, director of UC Observatories/Lick Observatory (UCO/Lick). Almost half of the observing runs on the Keck Telescopes are for one night or half a night.<br>
<br>
"This removes all the time and expense of traveling to Hawaii for just one night of observing, and even for two nights some would feel the travel savings are worth it," Miller said.<br>
<br>
Astronomers working in large teams, students, and instrumentation specialists will also benefit from the facility and from similar remote observing sites planned for other UC campuses, Miller added. Teams of astronomers collaborating on a project usually can afford to send only one or two people to Hawaii for an observing run, but now those left behind can join in the observations.<br>
<br>
"With additional facilities on other campuses, teams of observers can be split among several sites and they will all be able to see the same thing at the same time," Miller said.<br>
<br>
Students will also be able to get a taste of real-time observing with a world-class telescope, without needing to find travel funds. And the builders of instruments such as spectrographs that are used in conjunction with the Keck Telescopes will have easy access for troubleshooting and monitoring the performance of their instruments.<br>
<br>
The remote observing facility will take advantage of a new high-speed data link that connects observatories on Mauna Kea with Internet-2, a high-performance network used by U.S. research and education institutions. The 45-megabit-per-second link was established through the collective efforts of several agencies and institutions, including the University of Hawaii (UH), the Gemini Telescope Consortium, the National Science Foundation (NSF), and the University Corporation for Advanced Internet Development (UCAID), which oversees Internet-2. The U.S. Department of Defense provided the critical connection to the mainland on its Defense Research and Engineering Network.<br>
<br>
"Getting that connection was a major breakthrough, because a commercial telecom provider would charge $1.5 million per year for a 45-megabit-per-second circuit from the mainland to Hawaii," said Robert Kibrick, a research astronomer at UCO/Lick. Kibrick, who serves on a UCAID advisory committee, has been working to establish remote observing from the mainland since 1993.<br>
<br>
Remote observing from a facility in Waimea, 48 miles from the summit of Mauna Kea, is already the dominant mode of operation for most astronomers using the Keck Telescopes. This facility has freed researchers from the altitude sickness that often accompanies observing at the summit. Kibrick is setting up the UCSC facility to provide the same operational capabilities as the facility in Waimea.<br>
<br>
Located just down the hallway from Kibrick's office in Natural Sciences 2, the remote observing facility features several powerful workstations running specialized software for remote observing, as well as a videoconferencing station for communicating with support staff and collaborators in Hawaii. Several ISDN lines will provide a back-up connection, albeit much slower, in case the Internet-2 connection goes down during an observing run.<br>
<br>
Unlike the Waimea facility, UCSC won't have dark, quiet accommodations for sleeping during the daytime, which is one reason astronomers with long observing runs will probably continue to go to Hawaii. Isolation from interruptions and distractions is another advantage of leaving the mainland, according to Miller.<br>
<br>
"For several nights of observing, most people I've talked to would rather go to Hawaii," Miller said. "I like to go because it allows total immersion in your research, whereas here you're in reach of telephones and you might not be able to get as much work done. But remote observing offers a lot of benefits, and we plan to use the same facility for remote observations from the Lick Observatory on Mount Hamilton."<br>
<br>
Remote observing facilities are also planned for several other UC campuses, including UC Berkeley, UC San Diego, and UCLA. The UCSC facility will be the first in routine use when it becomes operational later this summer, Kibrick said.<br>
<br>
UCO/Lick, which is based on the UCSC campus, oversees the use of the W. M. Keck Observatory by UC astronomers. Observing time on the Keck Telescopes is shared among astronomers from UC, California Institute of Technology, NASA, and UH. The twin Keck Telescopes, each with a primary mirror 10 meters in diameter, are the largest optical and infrared telescopes in the world.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  A $2.2 million grant funded by the state of California's Academic Improvement and Achievement Act is giving a major boost to a collaborative effort by UC Santa Cruz and the Monterey County Office of Education, under the auspices of the Monterey Bay Educational Consortium (MBEC), to fund a five-year, $5 million effort to get more kids on the path to college. The grant will serve five participating regional high schools. MBEC brings together all the public higher educational institutions, county offices of education, and school districts in the Monterey Bay region to work toward increasing the number of students in San Benito, Monterey, and Santa Cruz Counties who attend college. With the new state funding, the Educational Partnership Center (EPC) at the University of California, Santa Cruz, is teaming up with the Monterey County Office of Education (MCOE) and the five high schools to implement the "Passport to Education Program." The goal of the program is to increase the number of high school students who, upon graduation, are eligible to attend a University of California or California State University campus. The amount of the four-year grant from the California Department of Education is $2.37 million. Contributions from UCSC and the five schools will raise the program's total budget to $4.94 million over five years. The participating schools are Watsonville, Seaside, North Monterey County, Greenfield, and Soledad High Schools. The Passport to Education Program is designed to create a pathway to college for students from eighth grade through 12th grade. "The goal is to infuse all aspects of school culture with the expectation among staff, students, and parents that all students can go to college," said Carrol Moran, director of EPC. "By the end of the 2004-05 school year, our goal is for each high school to equal or exceed the state average on five standard measures of success, including SAT scores." Academic support will focus on math and writing skills for "gatekeeping" courses like algebra I and II and college preparatory English that allow students to proceed toward college. College advocates will be hired to work at the high schools and "feeder" middle schools, and tutors will support the academic work of students in the schools. Test-preparation workshops will help students prepare for exams, and parent workshops will give parents information about college eligibility requirements, financial aid, and the importance of a college education to help them encourage their children to go to college. New interactive databases will allow teachers and university researchers and support personnel to monitor student accomplishments, with an eye toward shaping specific interventions for each student at each grade level, she said. Participating high schools serve more than 6,600 students, and an additional 2,500 eighth graders are enrolled in the feeder middle schools. "We want to increase awareness of college requirements and let students know how to get on track for college right away," said Moran. "We'll have easy access to the records that will show if they're getting off track, and if they are, we have developed a series of strategies to bring them back into the fold." In addition, EPC will expand the reach of its existing college preparation programs, including Early Academic Outreach Program (EAOP); Mathematics, Engineering, Science Achievement (MESA); and the local branch of Advancement via Individual Determination (AVID), to include students in the Passport to Education Program. "We look forward to working together with UCSC and our other partners as we build the aspirations and performance of students in these five high schools," said Nancy Kotowski, assistant superintendent for educational services with MCOE. As the lead educational agency, MCOE will administer the funds. Local business partners will help motivate students through mentoring, career talks, job-shadowing opportunities, events to recognize student achievement, and development of hands-on activities. Business partners include the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute, the Santa Cruz County Farm Bureau, the Pajaro Valley Chamber of Commerce, the Register Pajaronian newspaper, Graniterock Construction Company, the Soledad-Mission Chamber of Commerce, and the Soledad and Greenfield Rotaries. Additional educational partners that are contributing to the program include Cabrillo College, Hartnell College, the Monterey Bay Regional School-to-Career Partnership, and the Santa Cruz County Office of Education. The Academic Improvement and Achievement Act is a new statewide initiative to boost college preparation among eighth graders and to improve academic support and services offered to high school students.

<p>
  The most gratifying feedback Faye Crosby has received on her new book, <i>Sex, Race, & Merit: Debating Affirmative Action in Education and Employment,</i> came from an undergraduate who was a strong advocate of affirmative action--until she read the section of the book that presents arguments against such policies.
</p>"What she read made her think," said Crosby, a psychology professor at UC Santa Cruz who coedited the book with Cheryl VanDeVeer, director of UCSC's Document Publishing and Editing Center.<br>
<br>
It may seem odd that Crosby, a well-known proponent of affirmative action who has debated affirmative action foe Ward Connerly, would be happy to hear that the book made a pro-affirmative action student question her own beliefs, but Crosby and VanDeVeer were glad to have propelled someone to think more deeply about the issue than they had before. "If the book educates people and makes them reflect on the merits of both sides of the issue, we have accomplished our goal," said Crosby.<br>
<br>
<i>Sex, Race, & Merit: Debating Affirmative Action in Education and Employment</i> (Ann Arbor, MI: University of Michigan Press, 2000) brings together a rich array of material, including newspaper articles and essays by leading scholars on both sides of this divisive national issue, to trace the history of affirmative action. The book also features excerpts from primary sources, including key legal cases, California's Proposition 209, and legislative documents that first established affirmative action policy in 1965.<br>
<br>
The inspiration for the book came from last year's campus teach-in on affirmative action that was sponsored by the Affirmative Action Task Force of the Academic Senate. Crosby and VanDeVeer met at campus planning meetings for the teach-in, and the idea for the book was born.<br>
<br>
"I took Faye up on her idea of publishing a book, and we turned the project around in less than a year, which is a phenomenal feat for an academic press," said VanDeVeer. "We all felt a sense of urgency about getting this information out to the public."<br>
<br>
The unique faculty-staff collaboration was enhanced by the participation of psychology graduate students Sirinda Sincharoen and Pablo Mejia. "It was this diversity of talents and high-energy levels that made the book possible," said VanDeVeer, who has worked on campus since 1974. "It was very rewarding to me personally, because I've been acknowledged in a number of books over the years, but this is the first time my name has been on the cover. Faye insisted on that. I didn't know what a nice change that would be."<br>
<br>
The collaboration reflects a core campus value, said Crosby, who joined UCSC in 1998. "On a more hierarchical campus, Cheryl's work would have been hidden work," she said. "This type of collaboration is part of what makes UCSC such a vibrant intellectual community."<br>
<br>
Indeed, the editorial collaboration illustrates one of the benefits of affirmative action presented in the book, which is the pooling together of different perspectives made possible by diversity, said Crosby.<br>
<br>
Since its inception, affirmative action has been a controversial policy, and passions run high on all sides. <i>Sex, Race, & Merit</i> is designed to enhance intelligent discussion of the issues, presenting all sides of the controversy and working to separate fact from fiction.
<p>
  For starters, the editors present this definition of affirmative action:
</p>
<dl>
  <dd>
    Affirmative action occurs whenever an organization goes out of its way to make sure that there is no discrimination against people of color, against white women, against people with disabilities, or against veterans.
  </dd>
</dl>
<p>
  Part of the passion that has engulfed affirmative action stems from the proactive component of the definition, said Crosby. "It's the notion that you need to go out of your way to create justice that makes people nervous," she said. "Affirmative action is an acknowledgment that the world is less fair than we think and hope in our hearts and minds."
</p>
<p>
  That's also why business has been less resistant to affirmative action than academia, asserted Crosby. "People in business know things can go wrong and that you have to be very practical to reach your goals," she said. "They're more aware of that gap between reality and goals. Academics deal so much in the realm of ideas that we sometimes lose sight of the mismatch between ideas and reality."
</p>
<p>
  The most powerful arguments against affirmative action, in Crosby's view, are that it contributes to "race politics" and that it is too easy to corrupt the implementation of affirmative action policies. "Affirmative action makes race so salient that it becomes hard for individuals to get beyond their awareness of each other's race," she said. "It also sounds good in theory, but without proper implementation, it can result in a diluted workforce or student body. When misused, you don't get the best person for the job, or the best student for your college."
</p>
<p>
  Compelling arguments in favor of affirmative action are that it enhances the merits of any group by producing a broader pool of talented applicants. "When Yale University decided to admit women, the president said, 'Look, the test scores of our male applicants are dropping. We can either continue to accept lower-quality male students, or we can expand the pool to include women, and thereby get men with higher scores,'" described Crosby. "When you expand the pool, you get better a better quality of applicants."
</p>
<p>
  Affirmative action also shifts the focus from individuals to teams, and when the goals of an organization are more clear, diverse teams are always better, said Crosby. "Affirmative action is a shortcut to diversity, and we know from research that diversified teams can outperform others," she said. "Imagine two baseball teams that share the same goal of winning. If one team has only good pitchers, they may share the same goal, but they'll never get there."
</p>
<p>
  Successful affirmative action programs require institutional commitment and resources, noted Crosby, who has concluded that part of the controversy surrounding affirmative action is rooted in our country's democratic values.
</p>
<p>
  "At the core of every democracy is tension between the rights of the individual and the rights of the collective. When do we say the collective good outweighs individual rights?" said Crosby. "In some ways, affirmative action is geared toward ensuring the minimum collective good, and it requires us to regulate our society to achieve that goal. Affirmative action challenges unbridled individualism, and that strikes at bedrock issues of how we structure our society."
</p>
<p>
  The strength of <i>Sex, Race, & Merit</i> lies in its dispassionate presentation of the complexities that surround affirmative action, accomplished despite the editors' up-front support of affirmative action. "If people are going to argue about this, let's argue on the basis of information rather than misinformation," said Crosby.

  <font color="#003399"><b>Diversity dialogue group leaders</b></font>
</h4>

<p>
  <img align="right" border="0" height="169" src="../art/diversity_dialog.220.jpg" width="220" alt="">Small groups of campus staff have been meeting twice a month this year to discuss topics related to diversity. In these "diversity dialogue groups," individuals talk, listen, and learn about perceptions of differences and the fears that keep people apart. This year more than 30 people participated in diversity dialogue groups led by six staff members who underwent training to become group leaders. This year's leaders, pictured right, are (l-r) Pat Clark (Physical Plant), Lynda Tanaka (EEO/AA), Candace Ward (TAPS), Kathleen Hughes (OPERS), and Ricki Carr (Accounts Payable); not pictured: Kristin Rowe (Crown College). The groups are a project of the Diversity Education Program in the office of Equal Employment Opportunity/Affirmative Action.
</p>

<p>
  If you are interested in becoming a group leader or joining a group next fall, contact Robin Santos at rsantos@cats.ucsc.edu or (831) 459-3676. For general information about diversity dialogue groups and statements by group participants about their experiences, visit the <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/diversity/ddg.htm">program web site</a>.

        <title>UCSC Extension offers 30 percent discount to staff and faculty</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 22 May 2000 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>8834</wp:post_id>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  If you've had a hankering to brush up on the Bard before this year's summer festival, or if you're a wine enthusiast, an aspiring writer, an avid gardener, or a working professional eager to expand your skills set, look no further than the UCSC Extension catalog of summer classes.
</p>

<p>
  "Summer is when people want to take courses that feed their creative side," said Joselyn Ignacio-Zimardi, director of public relations for UCSC Extension. "We have a lot of teachers interested in professional development, but other people want to do travel studies, the bio-eco tours, or take a class in culinary arts."
</p>

<p>
  This summer's offerings include a four-evening class called, Understanding Shakespeare: <i>Love's Labour's Lost</i> and <i>Cymbeline.</i> Taught by William Mowatt, a member of the Board of Directors of Shakespeare Santa Cruz, the course will prepare participants to enjoy more fully the two Shakespeare plays being performed during the summer 2000 Shakespeare Santa Cruz festival. The course description promises "stimulating lecture, video clips, discussion, and participation in a nonthreatening environment."
</p>

<p>
  All UCSC faculty, staff, and students receive a 30 percent discount on fees (not to exceed $150 for any single course), added Ignacio-Zimardi.
</p>

<p>
  Other popular courses include numerous writing classes. <i>The World of Screenwriting</i> is hot in this area," noted Ignacio-Zimardi. Chefs might enjoy <i>Recipe for a Cookbook: How to Write Your Own,</i> which is taught by Suzanne Sherman, who has edited cookbooks for Chronicle Books and Ten Speed Press.
</p>

<p>
  Culinary arts classes are popular year-round, and this summer's guest-chef series features Marco Verduzco, owner of the popular Convivio Trattoria in Santa Cruz. Verduzco will teach three separate classes on contemporary California-Italian cuisine at his restaurant.
</p>

<p>
  If all that cooking makes you thirsty, check out the viticulture and wine appreciation section of the catalog, where you'll find classes that include <i>The Wines of Burgundy,</i> <i>The Wines of the United States,</i> and, if you're ambitious, <i>Basic Home Winemaking</i> and <i>Establishing the Home Vineyard.</i>
</p>

<p>
  In short, there's something for everyone in the UCSC Extension catalog. Visit the web site to see the full offerings <a href="http://www.ucsc-extension.edu">www.ucsc-extension.edu</a>.

        <title>Deadline for transportation survey extended one week to May 26</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 22 May 2000 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  Transportation and Parking Services (TAPS) is conducting UCSC's Spring 2000 Transportation Survey. Designed to assess the travel patterns and habits of faculty, staff, and students, TAPS will use the survey results to help plan new transportation programs and infrastructure improvements to better accommodate the needs of the campus community, said Larry Pageler, campus transportation planner.
</p>

<p>
  The survey, which originally had a deadline of May 19, can now be completed on or before May 26. As an incentive, respondents who complete the survey by the deadline and provide an e-mail address or phone number are eligible to win one of five $100 cash prizes.
</p>

<p>
  The survey will also be used to provide a "baseline" for comparison of future traffic conditions and a means of measuring the success of UCSC's various Travel Demand Management (TDM) programs, he said.<br>
  <br>
  It's been five years since UCSC participated in this type of commuter survey, and even longer since student commuters were included in the respondent pool. The ten-question survey asks respondents to describe their campus commute trips for each day of the previous week, May 7-11.<br>
  <br>
  This is also TAPS' first online survey, a step that dramatically reduces data entry time while conserving paper. If successful, TAPS hopes to conduct several more online surveys during this calendar year to address other specific transportation and parking issues. In order to accommodate staff and students without Internet access or who are having difficulty accessing the online survey, printed copies of the Spring 2000 Transportation Survey are available by calling TAPS at 459-2190.<br>
  <br>
  To participate, please go to the <a href="http://128.114.172.35/websurvey">survey</a>. For more information, contact Pageler at <a href="mailto:pageler@cats.ucsc.edu">pageler@cats.ucsc.edu</a>.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  Regional community college graduation ceremonies will be especially festive for 12 students who have been awarded $20,000 scholarships to attend UC Santa Cruz this fall. Recipients of the Karl S. Pister Leadership Opportunity Awards are selected in recognition of their accomplishments despite adverse socioeconomic circumstances. The awards program was established in 1993 to make it easier for community college students to transfer to UCSC. Recipients receive $10,000 scholarships for each of two years, as well as the support of a strong academic mentoring program and assistance finding paid summer work experience in a field that complements their studies. Now in its eighth year, the scholarship program has helped dozens of community college transfer students realize their dream of a university education. "We have seen through the success of previous scholarship recipients that our regional community college transfer students do very well at UC Santa Cruz," said UCSC Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood. "As our campus continues to develop new programs for transfer students, these scholarships provide very tangible opportunities for the leaders of tomorrow." The scholarship program was established by former UCSC Chancellor Karl S. Pister to increase opportunities for talented community college students who want to transfer to UCSC. The scholarships recognize students who have overcome adverse socioeconomic circumstances, who have a demonstrated commitment to assisting and improving the lives of others, and who might not otherwise be able to attend UCSC for financial reasons. Candidates are nominated by the presidents of each of 13 regional community colleges, and recipients are selected by Greenwood in consultation with the Leadership Opportunity Awards Program Screening Committee. A $5.2 million endowment has been established to fund the program permanently. Named scholarships honor contributors of major gifts to the program. A list of this year's recipients follows, with hometowns and college affiliations. For more information about the scholarship program or any of the recipients, call the UCSC Public Information Office at (831) 459-2495.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  Recognizing that the university needs to work harder to attract and retain good employees, administrators "at the highest levels" of UC's Office of the President are considering several workplace enhancements to maintain the university's competitiveness as an employer. "They are definitely looking at recruitment and retention issues," said Kathy Day-Huh, outgoing chair of the <a href="http://www.ucop.edu/cucsa/">Council of UC Staff Assemblies</a> (CUCSA). Day-Huh, executive assistant for the Miller Institute for Basic Research in Science at UC Berkeley, was on campus recently for CUCSA's spring meeting. CUCSA was established in 1974 to support communication with the Office of the President on behalf of nonrepresented staff. The council is composed of two delegates from each campus, the Office of the President, and the national labs who meet on a quarterly basis. "We are a funnel of information," said Day-Huh. At UCSC, up to 12 staff members can participate on the campuswide <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/sab/tree/">Staff Advisory Board</a>. Two board members are selected to serve two-year appointments as CUCSA delegates. UCSC's current delegates are Elaine Wedegaertner, associate registrar, and Peter Phillips, senior custodial supervisor. "It's been a very positive experience," said Wedegaertner, whose term ends this fall. "It's gratifying to see things come to fruition." Although CUCSA does not address terms and conditions of employment, the council has exercised its advisory role on numerous issues, including the extension of health benefits to domestic partners, the creation of catastrophic leave policies, and the adoption of the new Veteran's Day holiday. The council is currently advocating for the creation of faculty/staff partnerships on the campuses to enhance the workplace environment. "Right now, in the year 2000, we're looking at a new working environment," said Day-Huh. "Compared to 20 years ago, employees are more professional, staff have different and often complex responsibilities, and we are accountable on more issues. Faculty also may do a lot of their own clerical work now, so working relationships between faculty and staff have changed dramatically in the past 20 years." Faculty/staff partnerships could help offices focus on "best practices" to avoid problems, and they could provide resources when conflicts arise. Each campus could develop its own vision as part of the growing focus on "work/life" issues, said incoming CUCSA chair Ginger Birkholm, a legal analyst at UC Irvine. "With all the cuts of the early 1990s that haven't been restored, staff in some areas feel underappreciated," said Birkholm. "We're all working harder and longer, and feeling tremendous pressure without necessarily feeling appreciated for our efforts. Ultimately, we are all here to further the mission of the university, which is teaching, research, and public service." As the university braces for the enormous enrollment growth associated with "Tidal Wave II," issues of staff morale and workplace enhancement are at the fore, said Birkholm, who looks forward to assuming her CUCSA leadership role in the fall. "We all know we're not going to get rich working at the university, so why do we stay?" she asked. "It's because we're dedicated to the mission of the university, we like the atmosphere, and we're proud of the product. Working for the university gives us all those intangible rewards." Every workforce faces its share of challenges, but working together to find solutions is essential to long-range success, said Birkholm. "There are wonderful things being done on the different campuses, and part of our role is to share that information and encourage campuses to learn from one another," she said.

        <title>Silicon Valley engineer earns a master's degree in computer engineering from UCSC--without commuting</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  When Steve Canby receives his master's degree during graduation ceremonies at UC Santa Cruz on Friday, June 9, it will be one of the few times he has set foot on the UCSC campus. Yet most of the courses he took over the past three years to earn his degree were taught at UCSC. How did he do it? Welcome to the brave new world of distance learning. Canby is the first graduate of an innovative master's degree program in computer engineering with specialization in network engineering, offered jointly by UCSC's Jack Baskin School of Engineering and UCSC Extension. All of the courses required for the degree are offered in Santa Clara Valley through UCSC Extension. A pair of high-tech classrooms, one at UCSC and another at the Extension facilities in Cupertino, enable a professor at one site to teach two classrooms of students 25 miles apart simultaneously. "Most of the classes were taught from Santa Cruz and beamed over the hill," Canby said. "It started off feeling kind of funny because there's a TV camera on you, but after a couple of weeks you start interacting with the professor and you forget that you're not in the same room." About 60 other students are currently enrolled in the program, which was created to meet the needs of working engineers and other technical professionals in Silicon Valley. For Canby, who lives in San Jose and works in Santa Clara, the convenience of the program was crucial, enabling him to earn an advanced degree while continuing to work as a computer programmer at Gibbons and Associates, the software engineering firm where he has worked for the past 12 years. "This program worked well because it was designed for people who are working in Silicon Valley," Canby said. "I had thought about graduate school before, but the commute to the closest UC campuses, Berkeley and Santa Cruz, would be too much for me, and Stanford is too expensive." UCSC and UCSC Extension began offering the specialized master's program in fall 1997 in response to the rapidly growing demand for people with network engineering skills. "Silicon Valley is the home of many of the world's leading networking companies, and there is a great demand for highly trained specialists to design, develop, and support leading-edge network products and services," said Patrick Mantey, dean of the Jack Baskin School of Engineering. Canby said many of the courses he took were directly related to his current work. "It was clear they would help me immensely in my job," he said. "One of the requirements, a network design project, involved actually implementing a network protocol, and that was 100 percent applicable to my work." Not surprisingly, there were times when Canby felt challenged by the competing demands of course work, job, and family life. He and his wife, a financial analyst in Silicon Valley, have a four-year-old daughter. But the program did a good job of meeting his needs, both professionally and personally, he said. UCSC Extension is the largest provider of professional education in Silicon Valley and on the Central Coast, serving more than 50,000 students annually. With facilities in Santa Clara, Sunnyvale, Cupertino, Milpitas, Santa Cruz, and Monterey, UCSC Extension offers 3,000 courses each year in a wide range of continuing education programs for professional development and personal growth. A course catalog and additional information about UCSC Extension are available online at <a href="http://www.ucsc-extension.edu">www.ucsc-extension.edu</a>.

  The following letter was distributed to members of UCSC's Academic Senate today (May 17, 2000) by Roger Anderson, senate chair:

<p>
  Dear Colleagues:<br>
  <br>
  Last week, after receiving inquiries from Senators regarding the exact language of the legislation as amended and passed at the 23 Feb 2000 Senate meeting; the accuracy of the unapproved minutes; and the legitimacy of the legislation included with the mail ballot on grading, Secretary David Koo requested a ruling on the validity of the mail ballot from the Committee on Rules, Jurisdiction, and Election (RJ&E). Counting of ballots is pending until a written ruling from RJ&E is issued.<br>

        <title>Campus community encouraged to participate in online transportation survey</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 15 May 2000 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  Beginning Monday, May 15, Transportation and Parking Services (TAPS) will conduct UCSC's Spring 2000 Transportation Survey. Designed to assess the travel patterns and habits of faculty, staff, and students, the survey results will be used by TAPS to help plan new transportation programs and infrastructure improvements to better accommodate the needs of the campus community, said Larry Pageler, campus transportation planner.
</p>

<p>
  The survey will also be used to provide a "baseline" for comparison of future traffic conditions and a means of measuring the success of UCSC's various Travel Demand Management (TDM) programs, he said.<br>
  <br>
  It's been five years since UCSC participated in this type of commuter survey, and even longer since student commuters were included in the respondent pool. The ten-question survey asks respondents to describe their campus commute trips for each day of the previous week, May 8-12.<br>
  <br>
  This is also TAPS' first online survey, a step that dramatically reduces data entry time while conserving paper. If successful, TAPS hopes to conduct several more online surveys during this calendar year to address other specific transportation and parking issues. In order to accommodate staff and students without Internet access, printed copies of the Spring 2000 Transportation Survey are available by calling TAPS at 459-2190.<br>
  <br>
  As an incentive, respondents who complete the survey by May 19 and provide an e-mail address or phone number are eligible to win one of five $100 cash prizes.<br>
  <br>
  To participate, please go to the <a href="http://128.114.172.35/websurvey">survey</a>. For more information, contact Pageler at <a href="mailto:pageler@cats.ucsc.edu">pageler@cats.ucsc.edu</a>.

<p>
  At lunchtime, staff member Barbara Cool Lee wraps up her work in the Kresge Faculty Services Center and heads out to her other office--the passenger seat of her '92 Toyota pickup. Once there, she opens her laptop computer and writes.
</p>Lee has completed two manuscripts this way in the past seven years. And, in April, she learned that her latest manuscript has earned her a spot as one of five finalists in the national "Golden Heart Awards" competition sponsored by the <a href="http://www.rwanational.com/golden_heart2.stm">Romance Writers of America</a>.
<p>
  Lee's manuscript, titled "In Deep Water," is being considered in the "Romantic Suspense/Gothic" category for unpublished authors. The winner will be named at the organization's annual conference, which will be held in July in Washington, D.C.<br>
  <br>
  Lee heard the news with mixed feelings. "I was thrilled, but one of my first thoughts was, 'There's no way I can go,' " she recalls. "I didn't see how I could scrape together the money for airfare and hotels. But people in the business and friends were telling me that I couldn't miss this opportunity."<br>
  <br>
  While Lee tried to figure out how to finance her trip, a plot was hatched by colleagues Julie Brower and John Jordan to help her on her way. The two sent out a letter to some 50 faculty and staff asking for donations to help send Lee to Washington.<br>
  <br>
  Nearly 40 people responded, donating a total of $1,500--enough to cover the conference registration, airfare, hotel, and meals. "People were thrilled to contribute," says Brower, undergraduate adviser for the Literature Department. "We even had donations from people who were out of the country and one from a faculty member who no longer works here."<br>
  <br>
  "Barbara has been so helpful to so many people," says Jordan, a professor of literature and chair of the Literature Department. "She has a lot of computer expertise and many of us have projects we've taken to her. She is the one, locally, who bails us out. We're all in her debt and it was nice to have some way other than verbal thanks to acknowledge that. Plus, we all feel a lot of respect for someone who dedicates her life to writing, and were pleased to be able to support that work."<br>
  <br>
  The check was presented to Lee at a gathering in the Faculty Services Office in honor of her birthday. The unsuspecting Lee showed up expecting the usual cake and candles and instead got the surprise of her life. "I opened up the envelope and saw the check," she remembers. "I was shocked. I burst into tears."<br>
  <br>
  "When she opened the card," Brower says, "her eyes started to water. We got a chair under her right away. She was definitely looking weak in the knees."<br>
  <br>
  "I was so touched that so many people participated," Lee says, adding with a laugh, "Now I have the conference dates memorized because I am really going to go."<br>
  <br>
  As a finalist, Lee will have special opportunities to meet with publishers and agents. The honor gives her work credibility that is already prompting queries from editors.<br>
  <br>
  Lee's story is set on a lighthouse island based loosely on Point Sur. The main character is a woman who goes to the island to oversee a remodeling of the lighthouse. The woman has epilepsy and has lived a very sheltered life as a result. She decides to take on the lighthouse project as a way of establishing her independence. One night a wounded man washes ashore. He turns out to be a good guy, Lee says, but of course that's not immediately apparent. Lee describes him as a sweetheart, adding, "He's fictional, so he doesn't sit around drinking beer and watching television."
</p>
<p>
  Do the characters fall in love? "Of course!" Lee laughs.<br>
  <br>
  Lee wrote this manuscript on a laptop, but her previous manuscript, which has a similar setting and shares some storylines, was penned by hand. Lee, who has worked at the university since the mid-1980s, says she took a year's leave at one point to try and dedicate herself full-time to her writing. "I thought you needed to have large blocks of time to write. But you don't. It's like exercising, where you create this pattern. No matter what I'm doing at work, working on a database or whatever, I know that when I get in the passenger seat, I focus on my book. I go every day. On rainy days I take an umbrella and on sweltering days I roll down the window."<br>
  <br>
  Lee is already planning her next book, which she says has a "Sam Spade" feel to it. Like the others, it will have a level of suspense to it and, of course, a happy ending. But, as recent events have proved, romance fiction isn't the only place where happy endings occur.

  <font color="#003399"><b>Michael Nauenberg</b></font>
</h4>

<p>
  <img align="right" alt="book cover of " border="0" foundations="" height="260" newtonian="" of="" scholarship="" src="../art/newton_book.05-15.180.jpg" the="" width="180">Professor emeritus of physics Michael Nauenberg is coeditor of a book entitled <i>The Foundations of Newtonian Scholarship,</i> which will be available in June from World Scientific press. Nauenberg worked with Richard H. Dalitz of Oxford University to edit the book, which presents new developments and insights in Newtonian scholarship for students and scholars interested in the history and philosophy of science.<br>
  <br>
  Newtonian scholarship has taken great steps forward in the last half-century. The recent completion of critical editions of Newton's mathematical papers and of his scientific correspondence, as well as the publication of the first volume of his optical papers and of variant readings of the <i>Principia</i> in the original Latin, have made most of Newton's scientific work generally available for study and analysis for the first time. This has provided a better understanding of Newton's <i>Principia</i> and <i>Optics,</i> especially regarding their origin and interpretation, much of which has remained obscure for several centuries.<br>
  <br>
  The new book includes papers by several of the scholars who have made these primary sources accessible and by others who are using them to elucidate Newton's work. Most of the papers included were presented at the <i>Symposium on the Foundations of Newtonian Scholarship,</i> organized by Nauenberg and Dalitz and held at the Royal Society of London in March 1997.
</p>

<p>
  Currently Professor Nauenberg is working on a proposal to initiate a program in history of science and technology on our campus. For details see <a href="http://mike.ucsc.edu/~michael/">http://mike.ucsc.edu/~michael/</a>.<br>

<p>
  For Heidi McGough, it had to do with turning 50. A casual runner since 1980, McGough decided to celebrate the big five-oh milestone with a marathon. Last Sunday, while the rest of us lamented the spring drizzle, McGough completed the Avenue of the Giants marathon, her first-ever 26.2-mile run.
</p>"It was great," said McGough, assistant to the vice chancellor for University Relations. "It got hard at the end, of course, but I ran the first five miles with a man in his mid-60s. It was his 75th marathon."<br>
<br>
With her success, McGough joined an elite group of high-level athletes among UCSC faculty and staff who get their kicks by running marathons and competing in triathlons, which add distance bicycling and open-water swimming to the running component of the race.<br>
<br>
These dedicated individuals orient their work days, families, social lives, and in some cases, even their waking hours, around their training schedules.<br>
<br>
McGough had rarely run longer than about seven miles until she began training in December for the marathon. Her friend Barb Lee, who lives in South Lake Tahoe and runs the Wharf-to-Wharf and Bay to Breakers with McGough, signed on for the big birthday celebration and steered McGough toward the Web to find a training program. McGough posted copies of the 18-week schedule at home and at work--and she never once wavered.<br>
<br>
"I did every step of it myself," said McGough, joking that her pace is so slow she couldn't find a partner. The hardest part was getting up at 5 a.m. to get the miles in before work, especially in the rain. But she and Lee, another first-time marathoner who also completed the race, cheered each other on via e-mail and telephone calls. Now they plan to celebrate Lee's 50th birthday next year by running the Anchorage marathon in June 2001.<br>
<br>
Martin Wollesen, public events manager, began running marathons and competing in triathlons 15 years ago when a fellow swimmer suggested that he'd be good at it.<br>
<br>
"I loved it," said Wollesen, now 38. "I realized I could do it and wanted to do more and more of it." Over the years, Wollesen has completed too many triathlons to count, typically finishing in the top 15-20 percent.<br>
<br>
"I'm hugely competitive, and at the same time, I have a great need for variety in my life, so I couldn't be just a marathon runner or just a swimmer," he said. "That would be too boring!"<br>
<br>
The time commitment is formidable, requiring three to five hours a day from January through October, said Wollesen, who competes in half-Ironman triathlons that include a two-mile open-water swim, a 56-mile bike ride, and a 13-mile run. Fellow triathlete Dan Wirls, associate professor of politics, swims year-round at noon with the master's swim team on campus. The father of two young children, Wirls said finding time for running and bicycling is harder.<br>
<br>
"I try to squeeze it in on weekends before the kids get up," he said.<br>
<br>
For Wirls, turning 40 this year was good news because it puts him in a new age group. "Being at the top of your age category is no fun," said Wirls, who placed 25th overall in the 1998 Sentinel triathlon, which combines a one-kilometer ocean swim with a 40k bike ride and a 10k run.<br>
<br>
Wirls enjoys the competition and finds triathlons uniquely fulfilling.<br>
<br>
"You're dying the whole way through it, but when you finish, the feeling is just about as good as it gets," he said. "That lasts for a while."<br>
<br>
Wollesen described experiencing a similar thrill after a race. "Before my first triathlon, I was convinced I'd drown in the ocean or crash on my bike," recalled Wollesen. "After I finished, I was elated for weeks."<br>
<br>
Ann Lindsey, apprenticeship coordinator at the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems, has always been athletic, but she only discovered triathlons last year. Since then, she has completed two.<br>
<br>
"I love to run, I love to bike, and I like swimming, which I know I should do more of because it's easier on your body than a lot of sports," said Lindsey, 36, who suffered a major knee injury while playing soccer in 1997.<br>
<br>
Completing the Sentinel triathlon last year signaled the true end of her recovery from reconstructive knee surgery.<br>
<br>
"I'm deathly afraid of the ocean, so it was a big psychological challenge to get out there and swim around that wharf," recalled Lindsey. "Then, a couple of miles from the end of the bike race, I got a flat tire. My spare tube was defective, so it went flat, too. By then, I'd let go of any expectation I had about my time and just wanted to finish. I couldn't believe it when a woman stopped and gave me her spare tube."<br>
<br>
Running is a natural fit for Steve Gliessman, professor of environmental studies, too. A sports buff in high school, Gliessman said he wanted to go out for football but was too small. "I would've been squashed," said Gliessman, who turned to track and cross-country running, developing a lifelong love of the sport.<br>
<br>
Gliessman, 53, has completed lots of 10k races over the years and ran his first marathon in 1998, easily qualifying for the big Boston race. "I was pretty happy with my finish," he said, then surprised himself by being unable to recall his time precisely. "Out of 16,000 runners, I was around 4,000, I think."<br>
<br>
Like McGough, Gliessman said his 50th birthday prompted him to look for a new challenge, but the greatest benefit of his daily hour-long run along West Cliff and into Wilder State Park is that it gives him an opportunity to clear his mind.<br>
<br>
"Sometimes I get great ideas, solving a problem or getting ideas for a grant," said Gliessman. "But it really is an important time to just let go of stuff and get centered. It buffers me from the rest of the stressed-out life we're all forced to live these days."<br>
<br>
Jennifer Peters, a development assistant in University Relations, has made running a family affair, recently completing her second marathon with her 19-year-old daughter. "She finished six minutes ahead of me, at three hours and 40 minutes, so we both qualified for Boston, but we're not going," said Peters, who was training for Boston after her first marathon but was hit by a car one week before the race and was forced to sit it out.<br>
<br>
Endurance racing pushes participants to go beyond what they think they can do, and many athletes find that challenge becomes hard to resist.<br>
<br>
Celena Allison, a manager in Staff Human Resources, had been a runner "for ages" before tackling her first marathon in 1998. "It was a dream for a long time, but it never seemed attainable," said Allison.<br>
<br>
Inspired in part by running partners and longtime marathoners Pat Wightman Johnson, a travel assistant for the Natural Sciences Business Office, and former Santa Cruz mayor Katherine Beiers, Allison took the plunge and is about to start training for her fourth marathon.<br>
<br>
"It makes me feel free," Allison said of running, which she does on her lunch hour and on weekends. "It's a time when I can just be running, like a kid, and it nourishes my soul."<br>
<br>
Marathons, she said, are almost a metaphor for life.<br>
<br>
"When I accomplished that first goal, I didn't know if I would ever do another marathon," said Allison. "Later that week, though, I was already thinking about my next race. It's a metaphor for other things in my life. I say to myself, 'Wow, I can do this--I've run a marathon!'"<br>
<br>
And like so much in life, Allison said, there are lessons to be learned from running marathons.<br>
<br>
"It's a discipline, and you really need to train and prepare. It's at least two-thirds mental," said Allison, who has cut back to 80 percent time at work and is now a full-time graduate student in counseling psychology. "Training helps me look at things and break them down into doable pieces. If you go one step at a time, one mile at a time, you reach your goal."
<p>
  On Allison's current list of goals: cut five minutes off her time, which is now four hours, so she'll qualify for the Boston marathon in 2002, when the race will be held on her 46th birthday.<br>

        <title>A new campus map provides detailed view of UCSC</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_8810" align="alignright" width="181"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/05/map.00-05-15.188.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-8810" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/05/map.00-05-15.188.jpg" alt="The poster-size map Cartography: Cherie Northon" width="181" height="252" /></a>The poster-size map Cartography: Cherie Northon[/caption]
<p>
  A new map of UCSC, illustrating the campus with unprecedented clarity, made its debut at last month's Banana Slug Spring Fair. The new campus map differs from its predecessors in several important ways: It is detailed enough to show all paved pedestrian and bike paths, it shows the topography of the campus, and it has been produced in color.<br>
  <br>
</p>The poster-size map was created by cartographer Cherie Northon, using existing maps, aerial photos, and fieldwork to check for accuracy.<br>
<br>
The map, the first of a new series of UCSC maps, was produced under the direction of a campus committee headed by Susan Willats of the Office of Planning and Analysis.
<p>
  Work on the new maps commenced two years ago, Willats said. "I'd been wanting to create an accessibility map of the campus since I started working here in 1986," she said. "But there was no accurate base map with sufficient detail to start with."
</p>
<p>
  So Willats approached Tom Vani, vice chancellor of Business and Administrative Services, with a request to create a new campus map; Vani gave Willats the go-ahead. "The timing of my request was good because several members of the senior administration were relatively new to the campus, and they had experienced difficulty finding their way around campus," said Willats.<br>
  <br>
  Willats's map committee comprised staff from many of the campus units that use maps as part of their operations. Representatives from Housing, the Conference Office, University Events, Public Affairs, Transportation and Parking Services (TAPS), Physical Planning and Construction, and Printing Services met periodically to define and redefine the scope of the map project. Committee members also considered funding options and provided feedback on various draft versions of the campus map. Initial funding was provided by Housing, TAPS, Admissions, Public Information, and University Relations. The Division of Social Sciences and the Arboretum have provided subsequent funding.<br>
  <br>
  In addition to the initial poster version of the campus map, there will also be a folded version with locator maps for all off-campus sites (including Long Marine Lab, Lick Observatory, the MBEST Center, and all UNEX locations). In addition, there will be new "cluster" maps of all residential areas, a parking map, black-and-white maps in two sizes, and a Web version of the campus map. Work on these maps is continuing and is expected to be completed by December.<br>
  <br>
  The maps are now available at the <a href="http://www.bookstore.ucsc.edu/">Bay Tree Bookstore</a> for $8.95 each; campus units get a 10 percent discount.

[caption id="attachment_8807" align="alignright" width="180"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/05/haussler.00-02-28.180.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-8807" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/05/haussler.00-02-28.180.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="245" /></a>[/caption]
<p>
  Two UCSC researchers, a biologist and a computer scientist, are among the 48 scientists selected in a national competition to be appointed as investigators for the <a href="http://www.hhmi.org">Howard Hughes Medical Institute</a> (HHMI). David Haussler, professor of computer science and director of the Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering, was selected as a full investigator and Yishi Jin, assistant professor of biology, was selected as an assistant investigator. They will be the first HHMI investigators at the UCSC campus.
</p>"We are extremely pleased that the Howard Hughes Medical Institute has recognized the superb talents of David Haussler and Yishi Jin. It is an indication of the strength of UCSC's contributions in the area of biomedical and engineering research," said Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood.<br>
<br>
Haussler and Jin will join 305 current HHMI investigators across the United States, a prestigious group whose members include several Nobel Prize winners and more than 60 members of the National Academy of Sciences.<br>
<br>
"These new investigators are an incredibly talented group who have begun to make their mark on biomedical research," said Thomas R. Cech, who assumed HHMI's presidency on January 1. "We were looking for researchers who explore big questions and take risks--people with that special quality that leads to scientific breakthroughs and medical advances."<br>
<br>
Haussler is one of 12 scientists selected in the field of computational biology as part of a new initiative by the institute to pursue the growing opportunities at the confluence of biology and computing. Haussler has done pioneering work to develop computational techniques for finding genes in DNA sequences and analyzing other kinds of genomic data. He is currently involved in the Human Genome Project, an international effort to identify and understand all of the roughly 100,000 human genes. Haussler was also recently honored with a University of California Presidential Chair.<br>
<br>
For Jin, who studies the genetics of nervous system development, the selection by HHMI comes shortly after another major honor, a Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers, which she received in a White House ceremony in April. Most of Jin's research is based on experiments with a tiny nematode worm. She has been identifying the genes involved in creating the worm's relatively simple neural circuitry. So far, all of the genes she has found in the worm have turned out to have matching genes in humans and other organisms.<br>
<br>
The new HHMI investigators must still be formally appointed. HHMI is a medical research organization that enters into long-term research collaboration agreements with universities and other academic research organizations, where its investigators hold faculty appointments. Under these agreements, HHMI investigators and their teams carry out research with considerable freedom and flexibility in HHMI-funded laboratories located on the various campuses. The institute expects to spend between $500,000 and $1 million annually for each of its new investigators, including support to the host institutions for graduate training, library resources, and other needs.<br>
<br>
HHMI invited more than 200 U.S. institutions involved in biomedical research to nominate outstanding biomedical scientists to be considered for appointment as HHMI investigators. The 430 candidates nominated by their institutions were evaluated last month by a review committee of distinguished biomedical scientists meeting on the HHMI campus in Chevy Chase, Maryland. Following the recommendations of the advisers, 48 scientists were selected for potential appointment.<br>
<br>
The initiative in computational biology builds on recent efforts by scientists to solve important biological problems with new computational tools. The initiative complements the biomedical research that Hughes investigators have traditionally carried out in fields such as cell biology, genetics, immunology, neuroscience, and structural biology.<br>
<br>
During the past few years, HHMI scientists have made significant discoveries related to heart disease, cancer, AIDS, diabetes, tuberculosis, obesity, and many other medical problems. They also have developed important new research tools. Papers published by HHMI scientists are among those cited most often by other researchers.

        <title>Undergraduates reject fee increases, elect new SUA officers</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 15 May 2000 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>8805</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  Undergraduates rejected every initiative placed before them in the recent student election, while graduate students voted overwhelmingly to increase their fees to cover the costs of adding vision and dental insurance to their health coverage. (<a href="http://elections.ucsc.edu/elections/results2000.html">Complete election results</a>) Undergraduate turnout was 23.8 percent, and graduate turnout was 42.9 percent, for a combined campus turnout of 25.5 percent. All seven undergraduate initiatives were rejected by voters, including four OPERS-related proposals that would have increased student fees to fund additional physical education classes, intercollegiate athletics, recreation and intramural programs, and staffing and equipment. "It's difficult to get the two-thirds majority that's necessary to pass a ballot initiative," said John Holloway, executive director for student development and community service. "A number of measures got more than 50 percent, but they missed the two-thirds mark. For the second year in a row, undergraduates have rejected almost every proposed fee hike on the ballot." Holloway noted, however, that Measure H, which would have repealed a student fee that supports the student-run JunXion Pizza Co-op, also went down to defeat by a wide margin. Graduate students, on the other hand, approved Measures I and J to add vision and dental care to their health plans by margins of 86 to 14 percent, and 85 to 15 percent, respectively. The failure of Measure E, which would have increased student fees to support transportation on campus, has implications for the entire campus community, noted Wes Scott, director of Transportation and Parking Services (TAPS). "That means there will be less money for the shuttle system on campus," said Scott, who has continued to offer full shuttle service despite running at a deficit for two years. Students also rejected a proposal to create a new fee to cover the Student Union Assembly's (SUA) systemwide association fee, which is about $15,000 annually, said Holloway. Lauren Williams was elected chair of the SUA, while Jenny M. Jiang was elected UC Student Association representative for the campus. Matt Becker was elected campus office director of SUA, and Susie Vilayvanh was elected Lobby Corps director. The new officers will take their seats this fall, said Holloway. The results of the undergraduate opinion poll showed broad support for a proposal to move the Student Center to the location of the present Bay Tree Bookstore.
</p>

<p>
  Students also voiced support for discontinuing the campus's contract with Sodexho-Marriott Services because it is the leading financial investor in private-for-profit prisons, having the Student Regent selected by student representatives rather than by the UC Regents, adding a campuswide commencement ceremony on the East Field each June to the individual college ceremonies and receptions, and paying a $5 per quarter fee per student that would fund a free late-night ride service.<br>
  <br>
  Several items on the poll addressed the Narrative Evaluation System (NES) and proposed modifications to the existing system. Students expressed strong support for the current system.<br>
  <br>
  Opinion-poll topics are drafted by the SUA, Student Affairs, and Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Francisco Hernandez, said Holloway. The results provide a "cross-section" of student opinion on subjects of interest to the campus community, he said.<br>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  <a href="mailto:XX@cats.ucsc.edu"><br></a>UC Office of the President California Governor Gray Davis today (May 15, 2000) issued the "May Revision" to his 2000-01 state budget proposal. Major items affecting the University of California include the following:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>$600 million in funding from proposed lease-revenue bonds for earthquake-safety renovations at UC's five teaching hospitals. The hospitals would help repay the debt to the extent their financial circumstances allow. Also, $50 million in General Fund money is provided for non-seismic infrastructure needs at the teaching hospitals.
  </li>
  <li>$12 million for staff compensation increases, primarily to help UC address market-based salary lags.
  </li>
  <li>$50 million to expand access to Internet2. Of this amount, $18 million is provided to expand Internet2 access at UC campuses, and $32 million is provided to expand access at K-12 schools in California by utilizing regional hubs located at county offices of education.
  </li>
  <li>$44 million, provided to the Wildlife Conservation Board and the Department of Fish and Game, to foster the development of UC Merced in environmentally sensitive ways. This allocation will fund the development and implementation of various natural resources conservation plans, along with acquisition of acreage in eastern Merced County to help ensure protection of wetlands and wildlife. An additional $5 million is provided to UC to accelerate working drawings for the first two buildings at UC Merced.
  </li>
  <li>$35 million to fund exceptional needs in deferred maintenance and instructional equipment.
  </li>
  <li>$18.8 million to increase the duration of the UC-led Professional Development Institutes for teachers of mathematics and English-language learners in California's public schools.
  </li>
  <li>$1.1 million to provide scholarships for the Governor's Teacher Scholars Program, which provides a teaching credential and master's degree to candidates who agree to teach in urban or hard-to-staff schools for four years upon completion of the program.
  </li>
  <li>$1 million to expand high schools' access to UC's online Advanced Placement courses.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  "The governor has focused on some areas of high priority to the university and the state," said Larry Hershman, UC vice president for budget. "These augmentations will help UC expand its work with the public schools, improve compensation for staff employees and address critical facilities needs, particularly in the university's health-care facilities."<br>
  <br>
  UC officials were scheduled to provide a full report on the May Revision to the Board of Regents on Thursday, May 18.

        <title>UC, UAW reach tentative contract agreement</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  Dear Campus Colleagues:<br>
  <br>
  In the early hours this morning, the University of California and the United Auto Workers (UAW) reached tentative agreement on contracts for academic student employees, including teaching assistants, readers, tutors and certain others.<br>
  <br>
  Copied below is the news release just issued by the Office of the President. It provides as much detail as is available at this time. Both sides worked hard to produce a mutually acceptable resolution, and the University of California is pleased to have reached agreement.<br>
  <br>
  UAW members at each of the eight campuses now will vote to ratify the contract. Details of elections at UC Santa Cruz are still being arranged.<br>
  <br>
  This contract, the first since the unionization of student academic employees, will change some of the ways that we conduct the campus' business. As we learn more about the contract's provisions, there will be briefing sessions for faculty and others who will implement the new contract.<br>
  <br>
  Cordially yours,<br>
  <br>
  M.R.C. Greenwood<br>
  Chancellor

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br>
Wednesday, May 10, 2000<br>
Brad Hayward (510) 987-9195<br>
<a href="mailto:brad.hayward@ucop.edu">brad.hayward@ucop.edu</a><br>
<br>
UC, UAW REACH TENTATIVE CONTRACT AGREEMENT<br>
<br>
The University of California and the United Auto Workers (UAW) have reached tentative agreement on contracts at each of UC's eight general campuses for teaching assistants, readers, tutors and certain other academic student employees, the university announced today (May 10).<br>
<br>
"We are pleased to have reached agreement with the union," said UC President Richard C. Atkinson. "The parties have worked long and hard to make compromises and craft a mutually acceptable resolution."<br>
<br>
Atkinson thanked Marty Morgenstern, director of the state Department of Personnel Administration, for serving as mediator during the negotiations. "His role was crucial in helping the parties make progress toward an agreement," Atkinson said.<br>
<br>
The negotiations resulted in an estimated 9.5 percent salary increase over a multi-year period for academic student employees. This increase consists of an immediate 1.5 percent salary range adjustment, in addition to the 2 percent increase provided in October 1999, followed by range adjustments in October 2000, 2001 and 2002 that are anticipated to be 2 percent each, depending upon state allocations.<br>
<br>
The university, which now provides 60 percent remission of mandatory systemwide student fees for eligible graduate academic student employees, will increase that figure to 75 percent in fall 2000, 85 percent in fall 2001 and 100 percent by fall 2002.<br>
<br>
Other features of the tentative deal, which would expire in September 2003, include an agreement by the union not to strike for the duration of the contract and the creation of an internal process that uses Academic Senate faculty to resolve disputes regarding the workload of academic student employees.<br>
<br>
"We believe this is an agreement that is fair to academic student employees, that is within the resources available to us and that recognizes the central role of the faculty in maintaining UC's standards of academic excellence," Atkinson said.<br>
<br>
Tentative agreement was reached at the conclusion of a series of negotiating sessions in Sacramento that followed six weeks of voluntary mediation.<br>
<br>
Because bargaining units for academic student employees are campus-based rather than systemwide, the agreement will be reflected in eight essentially identical contracts, one for each of UC's general campuses. Ratification votes of the union membership will be held at each campus over the course of the next week, according to the UAW.<br>
<br>
Affiliates of the UAW were elected in the spring of 1999 to represent approximately 9,400 academic student employees at UC campuses. Systemwide negotiations for a first-time contract began in September 1999.

        <title>Elian: Behind the captured smile</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 08 May 2000 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>8800</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  Elian is smiling, therefore he is happy. After all, kids are resilient. He'll get over this. Kids get over divorce. Kids get over traumas. His father loves him, so he'll be O.K. Right? William Safire, in a recent <i>New York Times</i> article, asked "Which Picture Tells the Real Story?," Photo No. 1, showing the terrified child at gunpoint during the rescue effort, or Photo No. 2, showing the smiling Elian in the arms of his father only hours later. This question is a wonderful metaphor for the exquisitely oversimplified polarization that typically takes place on every level in high-conflict child custody disputes. Each side maintains that the child's true happiness lies with them and that any other expressions of happiness are faked or coerced by the other side. The truth is that, paradoxically, both sides are right. A child's happiness resides not with one side, but with his extrication from the middle of the dispute, and ultimately with a resolution that produces a single integrated life for the child. Elian's journey as a child of divorce began in Cuba and has been followed by a sequence of life-altering events that have landed him in the middle of an international, front-page, high-conflict child custody dispute. What are the psychological consequences to a child who has gone through so much? The stress on a young child of even a "good" divorce can be a formidable factor in compromising a child's long-term well-being. However, as you add other unfavorable factors to the mix, the outcomes worsen. Among the numerous variables known to affect a child's outcome from divorce are his predivorce adjustment, his temperament, including the degree of flexibility he exhibits, his ease in handling new situations, his sensitivity threshold, and how his caregivers interact with these temperament characteristics, the custodial parents' psychological adjustment, and the quality of the respective parent-child relationships. We also know that after one major life trauma, each additional major life trauma has an exponential, not additive, effect on a person. Elian has experienced a lengthy list of traumas since his parents divorced, including a terrifying ride on the open sea, the death of his mother, his rescue and capture by total strangers, an abrupt relocation to a different culture, language, school, and peers, and his sudden and continual exposure to a frenzied media. His recent seizure from the arms of his Miami caregivers by gun-wielding strangers was followed within hours by a reunion with his father (can he trust him this time?), adding yet another breach of emotional attachments to the list that began in Cuba when he left his father, followed by losing his mother, then losing his Miami relatives. And Elian smiles. He must be happy. Or is he? Perhaps of even longer lasting emotional impact is Elian's embroilment in the publicly and politically fueled custody dispute between his father and his Miami relatives. Research consistently shows that the more conflict between the child's caregivers, the worse the outcome for the child. Once a child becomes embroiled in a high-conflict custody dispute, several classic phenomena occur, including the development of what has been termed "tribal warfare" that is characterized by the rapid and exaggerated polarization of the disputants, with each gathering up supporters on the respective sides.
</p>

<p>
  This phenomenon has the force of a tornado, spinning and sucking into the fray everyone around . . . friends, families, lawyers, therapists. The sides are drawn and reality is then systematically twisted and distorted into equal and opposite versions of "the truth." As this process unfolds, the concept of truth becomes philosophically trivial as it becomes increasingly elusive and impossible to determine, even by judges and the court.<br>
  <br>
  The dispute is fueled as each side rewrites history, questioning each other's motives, intentions, and very identity, accusing one another of lying, incompetence, and even of being dangerous to the child. Extreme cases breed distorted or even false allegations of abuse and can result in child abduction, homicide, and/or suicide. All intentions are backed by the full and unwavering conviction of self-righteousness.<br>
  <br>
  Invariably, the capacity of caregivers to see the actual needs of the child becomes increasingly compromised as the level of conflict rises. Each caregiver truly believes they are representing the needs and interests of the child. The only problem is that each view is opposite and, as such, incompatible.<br>
  <br>
  Caregivers will often unconsciously (and sometimes very consciously) set up the child to turn against the other caregiver. In this state of being "caught in the middle," the child copes by saying things and behaving in ways that, unwittingly and unintentionally, contribute to the custody dispute, often telling each parent that he wants to live with that parent and not the other. The intention of the child may be to try to please each parent by showing loyalty, or to reunite the parents by forcing them to talk directly with each other, to prevent a parent from becoming angry, or to express any number of other motives. Unfortunately, the parents usually take literally what the child has said and proceed to seek custody through the courts. The effect is to increase the anger and mistrust between parents.<br>
  <br>
  As the dilemma peaks, participants prepare themselves for litigation, but courts have proven their inadequacy in this area. Disputants who "lose" repeatedly appeal for modifications of the court order, thereby prolonging the fight, and, paradoxically, escalating interparental conflict for the child, which, again, is the best predictor of a negative outcome for the child.<br>
  <br>
  Elian's case has transformed tribal warfare into an art form, with the added distortion of sound bites, photo-op snapshots, and competing sociopolitical interests that are sustaining the minute-by-minute, 24/7 media frenzy. The public, the media, and judges have been encouraged to draw conclusions about Elian's response to his ordeal with gross oversimplifications and distortions. Yet we actually know very little about Elian.<br>
  <br>
  But a child's resilience is a complex matter. There are so many factors that go into the mix, including his genetic coping abilities, the degree of predictability and stability of his relationships with caregivers, the extent of the familiarity of routines that are developed and stabilized in his life, and the number of future traumatic situations he will encounter (for which Elian has woefully little reserve).<br>
  <br>
  In fact, Elian will soon face one more trauma. The prospect of his being allowed to represent his own interests in seeking political asylum absurdly flies in the face of what we know about child development. Six-year-old children do not have the cognitive capacity to formulate the meaning of political persecution. Moreover, if Elian were to choose the United States, he would betray his father, an assured formula of psychological disaster for a child.<br>
  <br>
  In the end, we will see how this plays out in the court of politics. Let us hope that sanity prevails.<br>

        <title>Governor names Hernandez to higher education panel</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_8798" align="alignright" width="180"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/05/hernandez_francisco.180.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-8798" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/05/hernandez_francisco.180.jpg" alt="Francisco Hernandez Photo: Don Harris" width="180" height="261" /></a>Francisco Hernandez Photo: Don Harris[/caption]
<p>
  Francisco J. Hernandez, vice chancellor of student affairs at UC Santa Cruz, has been named by Governor Gray Davis to the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education (WICHE).
</p><br>
The commission facilitates resource sharing among higher education in its 15 member states. Its programs include an initiative to help states use new technologies more effectively for education, a doctoral scholars program to increase the diversity of college faculty, a program that helps states prepare a qualified mental health workforce, an electronic communications forum linking the North American academic community, policy exchanges, and a student exchange program that serves more than 9,000 students each year. Commission members serve on a volunteer basis.<br>
<br>
Hernandez, 52, of Scotts Valley, has been an administrator of higher education for 20 years. Since 1994, he has been at UCSC, where he is responsible for the quality of student life through residential life programs, student services, and enrollment services.<br>
<br>
"This appointment recognizes Vice Chancellor Hernandez's administrative leadership and gives him a forum in which to expand his influence on the future of higher education," said UCSC Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood. "Our campus benefits greatly from his work here, and I am pleased that he will be making contributions in a broader context, as well."<br>
<br>
Hernandez's experience also includes ten years of teaching, most recently at UCSC, where he has taught courses on minorities in higher education. He is a member of the American Association for Higher Education, the National Association for Chicana and Chicano Studies, and the Hispanic Association of Colleges and Universities. He earned his undergraduate degree from UC Berkeley and his master's and doctorate from Stanford University.<br>
<br>
"Educators have an obligation to work together to maximize their impact," said Hernandez. "The UC system is a key institution among western colleges and universities, and I look forward to working with my fellow commission members to foster our collective success."<br>
<br>
Hernandez was one of three people whose appointment to WICHE was announced by the governor's office on April 28. Their appointments require Senate confirmation; no date has been set.

<p>
  For the first time since 1972, UC Santa Cruz is pleased to announce the founding of a new college. College Nine will serve as the intellectual home of students interested in global and international studies, the first of whom will enroll in fall 2000.
</p>"Like the campus's other eight colleges, College Nine will integrate living and learning environments by bringing together students with shared interests," said UCSC Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood. "Students affiliated with the college during its first years will have the opportunity to work with faculty and staff to develop the college's theme of global studies and to shape the academic direction of the college."<br>
<br>
Unlike its predecessors, College Nine will operate under the general oversight of an academic division rather than the dean of undergraduate education. The Division of Social Sciences, with its focus on the study of interpersonal relationships and human society, was the natural academic umbrella for the college, said Greenwood. As dean of Social Sciences, Martin Chemers has been closely involved with the establishment of College Nine.<br>
<br>
"College Nine's affiliation with the division will strengthen the academic themes of global studies, including economics, ethics, and cultural diversity," said Chemers. "We want to encourage undergraduate research, interdisciplinary studies, and experiential learning through academic field programs and internships. Residential and co-curricular programs will reflect the college's intellectual themes, as well."<br>
<br>
Deana Slater was recently named college administrative officer of College Nine. She is charged with overseeing the student affairs functions of the college, including co-curricular and academic programming, administration, and residential life. A search is currently under way for an associate dean of the college, who will report to Chemers while fulfilling the responsibilities of college provost.<br>
<br>
Construction of apartments that will accommodate 280 continuing and transfer students is under way and is expected to be completed this fall; residence halls that will house 400 students are slated to open in fall 2001. Final plans include the building of residence halls for 400 students affiliated with College Ten and a dining hall that will serve both colleges, said Slater.<br>
<br>
Located in a redwood grove next to Social Sciences 1 and 2, College Nine is the first college to open at UCSC since College Eight was established in 1972. A nature reserve behind the college provides immediate access to hiking and running trails.<br>
<br>
College Ten will emphasize the theme of social justice and equity. Together, up to 3,000 students will be affiliated with Colleges Nine and Ten when they are completed.<br>
<br>
Cowell College was the first to open its doors on the campus in 1965, followed by Stevenson, Crown, Merrill, Porter, Kresge, Oakes, and College Eight. The campus's first seven colleges have been named for major donors; Colleges Eight, Nine, and Ten are available for renaming in honor of major campus contributors. All undergraduates and most faculty are affiliated with one of the colleges, which are committed to fostering a nurturing and academically thriving environment for students of all backgrounds. Each self-contained college is home to 40 to 90 faculty members and between 1,100 and 1,400 students, about half of whom live on campus. The colleges have their own academic emphases and cultural traditions, and they play a primary role in academic advising and are the center of student life.

<p>
  One of the country's most noted scholars on race and inequality, William Julius Wilson is coming to UCSC on Monday, May 15, to deliver a free public lecture on bridging the racial and economic divide in this country. His talk will take place from 5 to 6:30 p.m. in the Media Theater in the Theater Arts complex at UCSC.
</p><br>
A recipient of the prestigious MacArthur "genius" award, Wilson will be discussing his new book <i>The Bridge Over The Racial Divide: Rising Inequality and Coalition Politics.</i> Two of his previous books, <i>The Truly Disadvantaged</i> and <i>When Work Disappears,</i> were chosen as notable books by the <i>New York Times Book Review.</i><br>
<br>
Wilson is a leading expert on urban development and social inequality. His influential ideas about race and class politics in America and the need for a progressive, multiracial political coalition to combat growing inequality are being discussed by policy makers, social activists, labor leaders, and academics. His visit to UCSC is being sponsored by the campus's new Center for Justice, Tolerance, and Community (CJTC).<br>
<br>
"William Julius Wilson is a strong proponent of coalition building among African Americans, Asians, Latinos, women, religious groups, and civil rights groups," said CJTC director Manuel Pastor, a professor of Latin American and Latino studies. "He has long been on the forefront of analysis and policy designed to forge bridges between diverse communities and their interests, and to press for changes that could benefit working- and middle-class Americans."<br>
<br>
Wilson argues that such a multiracial alliance of working- and middle-class Americans could be developed if groups were persuaded to downplay racial differences and focus instead on their common interests, such as stagnating and declining real incomes in the wake of changes in the global economy. He advocates the creation of national work programs, universal health care, a national child care system, and national education standards. Improved job-training programs and public transportation would make "new economy" jobs accessible to the urban poor while also benefiting the working and middle classes, says Wilson, who in 1996 was named one of <i>Time</i> magazine's 25 most influential Americans.<br>
<br>
Wilson's talk is the inaugural event sponsored by the CJTC. Free parking will be available beginning at 4:30 p.m. in the Theater Arts parking lot and in the North Remote Lot. Vans will be on hand to shuttle people from the North Remote Lot to the Media Theater.<br>
<br>
The CJTC is an interdisciplinary research, policy, and education center created to address issues of social justice and diversity while building collaborative communities. For more information on the center and its activities, call (831) 459-5743 or send e-mail to <a href="mailto:cjtc@zzyx.ucsc.edu">cjtc@zzyx.ucsc.edu</a>.<br>
<br>
Cosponsors of the event include UCSC Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood, the Departments of Anthropology, American Studies, Community Studies, Economics, Education, History, History of Consciousness, Politics, Psychology, Sociology, and Women's Studies. Support was also provided by the Center for Cultural Studies, the Chicano/Latino Research Center, the Latin American and Latino Studies Program, Merrill College, and Oakes College.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  A "mail ballot" has been distributed asking all 588 members of UCSC's Academic Senate to weigh in on the proposal to implement UC's conventional grading system for entering UCSC students in fall 2001. The request for such a ballot was made by 27 senate members and had been expected in the wake of the senate's 154-77 vote in February to place UCSC's grading policies in line with other UC campuses.
</p>

<p>
  Mary-Beth Harhen, director of the senate office, said ballots are due by 5 p.m. on Friday, May 12. They must be received in the senate office (125 Kerr Hall) by that time. Any member of the senate not receiving a mail ballot--they were distributed the week of April 24--should contact the senate office by phone (831) 459-2086) or by e-mail (<a href="mailto:senate@cats">senate@cats</a>). Information on the vote is also available on the senate Web site at (<a href="http://senate.ucsc.edu/mailball/grading">senate.ucsc.edu/mailball/grading</a>).
</p>

<p>
  The grades resolution will be decided by a simple majority, and the outcome of the vote should be known prior to the next senate meeting, scheduled for May 31. At that meeting, senators are scheduled to discuss the campus's Narrative Evaluation System. The May 31 meeting, which will take place in Classroom Unit 2, begins at 2 p.m.

<p>
  Six community college students who conducted independent research projects at UCSC are now sharing their experiences with local high school classes through a new outreach program called "Leading with Research." In their motivational presentations, the students talk about doing research at UCSC and what it takes to be successful in college.
</p><br>
Each of the student presenters took part in the ACCESS Summer Research Institute, an eight-week science internship for community college students operated out of the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry.<br>
<br>
"They are all hard-working, successful college students who are committed to the task of motivating more young students to go to college and think about a career in science," said Lisa Hunter, who directs the ACCESS program together with professor of chemistry Phillip Crews.<br>
<br>
Leading with Research is part of a major outreach effort by UCSC to increase the diversity of the campus's student population. The program is funded by UCSC Transfer Partnerships and a contribution from Seagate Technology. Some of the participants are also involved in "Research Saturdays," a new program sponsored by the UCSC Educational Partnership Center that gives high school students a picture of UCSC science, scientists, and students through a variety of activities held on campus.<br>
<br>
Erika Angel, a Cabrillo College student and graduate of Santa Cruz High, is one of the students who will be visiting local high schools. Angel's summer research project focused on the purification of soybean lipoxygenase, an enzyme related to a human enzyme involved in asthma, atherosclerosis, and cancer. She worked under the guidance of assistant professor of chemistry and biochemistry Theodore Holman.<br>
<br>
"The ACCESS program was invaluable to Erika because she had never been exposed to research and had no idea what was available to her," Holman said. "I daily saw the wonder and excitement in her eyes as she discovered new results and related them back to her undergraduate instruction. By the end of her stay in my lab, scientific research became a viable career path for her."<br>
<br>
Angel will be transferring to a four-year university this fall and is currently deciding between several options, including UCSC. She has also been accepted to UC Davis, UC Irvine, UCLA, and Saint Mary's College and is waiting to hear from UC Berkeley.<br>
<br>
Another student, Malika Moutawakkil, has already visited many classes this year, ranging from 6th to 12th grades, and hopes to continue to inspire young students to pursue science. The presentation Moutawakkil gives to high school students is called "College, Sea Sponges, and Your Future." Her research, under the guidance of Crews, focused on marine sponges as a source of potential anticancer drugs. Moutawakkil graduated from Santa Cruz High School, attended Cabrillo College, and transferred to UCSC in the fall of 1999 as a chemistry major.<br>
<br>
Local high school teachers have been impressed by the students who visited their classrooms. Watsonville High School science teacher Bill Callahan said the presentation in his class by San Jose City College student Kassandra Rossiter was "the best thing for my kids."<br>
<br>
Rossiter, who visits classrooms in the San Jose area as well as in Santa Cruz and Monterey Counties, will transfer to UCSC this fall and has received a $20,000 scholarship through the Karl S. Pister Leadership Opportunity Awards Program. Aptos High School teacher Anita Natale, whose class Rossiter also visited, said she thought her students were most impressed by the idea that someone only a few years older than themselves could be actively involved in scientific research.<br>
<br>
"It was a poised, professional, inspiring presentation and the students could really relate to it," Natale said.<br>
<br>
Angel, Moutawakkil, Rossiter, and 15 other community college students took part in the 1999 ACCESS Summer Research Institute. This year, another 18 students from Cabrillo, Hartnell, Gavilan, and Monterey Peninsula Colleges will participate.<br>
<br>
The goal of the ACCESS program is to increase the number of underrepresented students who transfer from community colleges to four-year universities and pursue degrees in the area of biomedical research. The program is funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Bridges to the Future program and the UCSC Transfer Partnerships Program. ACCESS offers services and support for all students at participating community colleges.<br>
<br>
The Summer Research Institute is a highly selective component of the ACCESS program, and students who complete this portion have been tremendously successful, Hunter said. After completing the summer, each student is prepared to attend conferences, present their research findings, and apply for other internships.<br>
<br>
"Working in a lab helps students to understand the information they get in their courses and gives them an entirely different perspective on textbook information," said professor of biology Barry Bowman, who has sponsored undergraduates in his lab for many years.<br>
<br>
Bowman also directs UCSC's Minority Biomedical Research Support (MBRS) program, which gives students hands-on experience in research labs and helps them prepare for graduate school. "These programs have been very successful in exposing students to new ideas about careers," he said. "One of the best measures of the impact of our minority programs is that more than 95 percent of our participants successfully complete degrees in biology and chemistry."

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_8788" align="alignright" width="200"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/05/whitworth.00-05-01.200.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-8788" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/05/whitworth.00-05-01.200.jpg" alt="A scene from the 1994 Shakespeare Santa Cruz production of The Rape of Tamar Photo: Shmuel Thaler" width="200" height="133" /></a>A scene from the 1994 Shakespeare Santa Cruz production of The Rape of Tamar Photo: Shmuel Thaler[/caption]
<p>
  The name Tirso de Molina is well known among critics, but until recently the 17th-century Spanish playwright was little known to the general public. That changed in 1992, when the Lyric Studio Theatre in London staged <i>The Rape of Tamar</i>--considered one of the most powerful of the 80-odd plays attributed to Tirso. That staging is believed to be the first public performance of the play in roughly 350 years. Judging by the rave reviews from critics, the event was long overdue. Those reviews reflected not only the genius of the neglected playwright, but also the exceptional translation and writing skills of theater arts professor Paul Whitworth.
</p>Whitworth's translation premiered in the U.S. in 1994 at Shakespeare Santa Cruz (where Whitworth is currently artistic director) and, this past year, was published in the Absolute Classics series by Oberon Books, London.<br>
<br>
The translation, which has received a steady stream of critical acclaim, benefits from Whitworth's dual sensibilities as an actor and director and as a scholar. The translation communicates Tirso's dramatic intent and at the same time manages to transfer into English the play's original cadences (including iambic pentameter) and rhyming schemes. The <i>London Evening Standard</i> noted, "There is considerable comedy and irreverent wit in Mr. Whitworth's translation, which contains the best rhyming couplets this side of Tony Harrison." A critic from the <i>Independent on Sunday</i> said, "Brilliantly translated by Paul Whitworth, the play dramatises lust, vengeance and parental grief alongside down-to-earth pleasures, and comic realism"<br>
<br>
Both the London and California stagings of the play garnered accolades. In London it was named one of the "Five Best Plays" by the <i>Independent on Sunday,</i> while the Shakespeare Santa Cruz production won five Dramalogue Awards. Whitworth directed both productions and also played a leading role in Santa Cruz as King David.<br>
<br>
Tirso de Molina lived from 1582 to 1648. A Mercedarian monk, he wrote popular plays for the public theaters of Madrid, the most famous of which is <i>El Burlador de Sevilla,</i> the first great dramatic treatment of the Don Juan story. According to Whitworth, "<i>The Rape of Tamar</i> is one of the most erotic plays of the Spanish Golden Age. It blends 17th-century Spanish revenge drama with a strange episode from the Old Testament, telling the story of the incestuous rape of Tamar by her half-brother Amnon."

        <title>Women audiences influenced early film in surprising ways, says UCSC professor</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_8781" align="alignright" width="180"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/05/stamp.book.00-05-01.180.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-8781" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/05/stamp.book.00-05-01.180.jpg" alt=" " width="180" height="280" /></a> [/caption]
<p>
  "Ladies, if you spare us one evening and make use of the enclosed tickets, we will consider it a favor."
</p>In the 1910s, promoters in the fledgling film industry began actively courting women audiences. Most filmgoers up to that point had been largely male and mostly working class or immigrants. Promoters hoped, by drawing more women into their theaters, the entire industry would gain respectability.<br>
<br>
The promotional outreach did succeed in attracting more women to the theaters, but the aim to create more of a highbrow tone was not always successful, according to UCSC film historian Shelley Stamp.<br>
<br>
Stamp, an assistant professor of film and digital media, explains why in a new book, released in April by Princeton University Press. The book, <i>Movie-Struck Girls: Women and Motion Picture Culture after the Nickelodeon,</i> contradicts the long-held belief that the presence of women in the theaters in the 1910s toned up the cinema. Through careful and wide-ranging research, Stamp comes to a very different conclusion.<br>
<br>
"This is a period of real transformation in the film industry. The industry at this point is 15 to 20 years old and is starting to become more sophisticated as a visual and narrative medium, but still lacks wide cultural acceptability," Stamp says. "When female audiences are targeted, you see new forms of cinema emerge, but they are not the sophisticated type of entertainment that promoters envisioned."<br>
<br>
In fact, of the three more popular genres among women--serials, white slave films, and suffragist films--the latter two were actually considered quite scandalous by many people at that time.<br>
<br>
"The so-called 'white slave films' were made to capitalize on a panic that was raging at the time," Stamp explains. "The fear was that innocent young women could be captured off the streets and be sold into prostitution." Ironically, Stamp says, three of the sites that films warned women to stay away from were amusement parks, dance halls, and movie theaters.<br>
<br>
"There is evidence that most of the audiences for these films were women. The films were, by the standards of the day, quite frank about sexual matters and there was a lot of concern about why women were getting enjoyment out of these films."<br>
<br>
Stamp also looked at serial films--ongoing adventures featuring young heroines--the most famous of which is probably <i>The Perils of Pauline.</i> Each film ended with a cliff-hanger so that audiences would come back for the next feature to see what happened. Unlike the white slave films, the serials were specifically designed for young women.<br>
<br>
Many of the films were advertised with sweeping promotional campaigns. In the same way fans can buy Jar Jar Binks underwear or Lion King cereal bowls, movie fans in the 'teens could buy pillows and spoons and paper dolls featuring their favorite heroines. Many serials also sponsored promotional contests. Although enormously popular, the serials were not highly regarded as an art form.<br>
<br>
The third genre Stamp examines are women's suffrage films. "The two major national suffrage organizations of the time get involved, figuring, 'If <i>The Perils of Pauline</i> can rake in all these viewers, why can't we?' " Stamp says. The organizations produced feature-length films. The films were fictional, usually featuring young likable heroines who get involved in the suffrage movement. Sometimes the fictional characters would meet actual leaders of the suffragist movement in films. Among the real-life women to make cameo appearances in films were Harriot Stanton Blatch, Jane Addams, and famed British radical Emmeline Pankhurst.<br>
<br>
"The suffragists really grasped the idea that you could use cinema to promote your cause. Again, it was interesting from my point of view because you would think this would be a perfect marriage of women and respectability and movies. But there was a lot of concern expressed about these films and the speeches that accompanied them in the theaters. Here we have women going to the movies, which is what the industry wanted, but they're going to feminist movies and shouting and cheering at the speeches."<br>
<br>
Stamp conducted her research over a period of ten years, drawing on a wide range of sources. Many of the films she reviewed are no longer circulating but are housed at the Library of Congress and the UCLA Film and Television Archive. She also studies trade journals, fan magazines, ephemera, and a variety of official documents and records at the National Board of Censorship Archives in New York City, the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts, and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences' Margaret Herrick Library in Los Angeles.<br>
<br>
The book has already received critical approval. Leading early-cinema expert Tom Gunning of the University of Chicago notes, "Stamp provides a model film history, keenly aware of the images on the screen, women's political activism in relation to film, and the practices of everyday life in moviegoing. This is the book to read on women and American silent film as it established itself as an aesthetic, social, and political practice."

        <title>Engineer Peyman Milanfar wins major award from National Science Foundation</title>

<p>
  Assistant professor of electrical engineering Peyman Milanfar has received a major award from the National Science Foundation's Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program. Milanfar will use the $225,000 grant to develop a long-term research and educational program in multidimensional signal processing.
</p>The CAREER Program grants are the National Science Foundation's most prestigious awards for new faculty. The CAREER program recognizes and supports the early career development activities of faculty members who are most likely to become the academic leaders of the 21st century.<br>
<br>
Milanfar's work in the area of image and signal processing has applications in a broad range of fields, including astronomy, geophysics, medical imaging and nondestructive testing of materials. Indirect measurements, as opposed to direct observations, play an increasingly important role in gathering information about the world around us. Through technologies that extend and complement human sensory faculties, people are able to probe across great distances and through natural barriers.<br>
<br>
At the heart of this ability to make and interpret indirect measurements are practical computational techniques for processing the measured data and distilling the information of interest from the data. These techniques must bring together tools from multidimensional signal processing, statistics, and applied mathematics to solve what are known as "inverse problems." An inverse problem basically involves measuring an effect and working backward to determine its cause.<br>
<br>
"These kinds of problems are ubiquitous--they arise in a wide range of situations," Milanfar said.<br>
<br>
Milanfar's program will integrate engineering, statistical, and numerical techniques for the solution of inverse problems in imaging. The educational component will involve designing a comprehensive graduate and undergraduate curriculum in statistical signal and image processing in the Department of Electrical Engineering.<br>
<br>
The research component of the program will address problems in image reconstruction from indirectly measured information that may be incomplete or noisy. Examples include extracting information from blurred images of a detailed scene or two-dimensional silhouettes of three-dimensional objects.<br>
<br>

        <title>Systemwide task force focuses on faculty/staff concerns</title>

    "The greatness of the University of California follows from the excellence of its people--its faculty, staff and students; however, a mere collection of outstanding individuals will not advance the University. Our ability to excel in our missions depends on collaborations and collegial environments. A collegial atmosphere can only come about through strong partnerships based on mutual trust and respect. Therefore, in support of the University's missions, the faculty and staff of the University of California affirm their responsibility and commitment to creating and fostering a cooperative and professional working environment." --UC Task Force on Faculty/Staff Partnership
  </dd>
</dl>

<p>
  In January 1999, two UC groups came together to identify common interests between faculty and staff and to find ways to foster cooperation and mutually beneficial working relationships between the two groups. The task force was supported jointly by the Council of University of California Staff Assemblies and the Academic Council of the systemwide Academic Senate. In December 1999, the group issued a report affirming the importance of collaboration and making recommendations to foster a positive work environment. Their recommendations are to:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Develop a faculty/staff partnership Web site in order to increase the visibility of best practices that support collaboration;
  </li>
  <li>Build an awareness of the avenues available to faculty and staff to resolve conflicts through campus Ombuds programs, mediation service, and other mechanisms;
  </li>
  <li>Foster open and inclusive communications at the department level among faculty and staff members;
  </li>
  <li>Recognize that there are differences in roles, but that both faculty and staff bring value to the university, and equally share responsibility for creating and sustaining a positive work environment;
  </li>
  <li>Expand knowledge through training and development opportunities already available to include discussions on faculty-staff relations;
  </li>
  <li>Reexamine the Faculty Conduct and Administration of Discipline to address faculty and staff relations, workplace conduct, and the administrative and supervisory responsibilities of faculty.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  <br>
  According to Willeen McQuitta, director of Staff Human Resources, "The partnership statement that is outlined in the task force report is truly wonderful. I'm extremely pleased to see that both faculty and staff are committed to creating and fostering a cooperative, professional work environment. This is the first time we've seen such a concerted collaboration between faculty and staff. The task force has produced some excellent best practices information that all of the campuses can use to improve the work environment."<br>
  <br>
  Assistant Chancellor of Human Resources Julia Armstrong-Zwart and psychology professor Barry McLaughlin, chair of the Academic Senate Committee on Faculty Welfare, have jointly proposed to Chancellor Greenwood that a committee on work/life issues be established to advise the chancellor on matters affecting the working environment at UCSC. Chancellor Greenwood has indicated that she is willing to name a task force for this purpose and has asked Armstrong-Zwart and McLaughlin to assist in developing the specific charge of the group and to advise on possible membership.<br>
  <br>
  Chemistry professor Roger W. Anderson, who was UCSC's representative on the task force, notes that, "There was remarkable consensus among committee members on the analysis of faculty/staff interactions on the campuses. It seems that, although we are looking at nine very different campuses, there are some universal concerns." The group not only identified common issues, Anderson said, but worked exceptionally well together. "I think the committee came up with some excellent recommendations, which I look forward to seeing implemented as soon as possible."<br>

        <title>Best-selling novel dedicated to UCSC librarian</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_8775" align="alignright" width="180"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/05/gordon_marg.00-05-01.180.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-8775" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/05/gordon_marg.00-05-01.180.jpg" alt="Margaret Gordon, with the novel that was dedicated in her honor.

<p>
  Although well known in the local community, UCSC librarian Margaret Gordon never had to deal with widespread fame until recently. Now Gordon's name is known to just about every romance novel fan in the country, thanks to a dedication in a <i>New York Times</i> best-seller.
</p>The book, <i>The Wicked Widow,</i> is authored by UCSC alumna and best-selling romance novelist Jayne Ann Krentz. The dedication reads, "For Margaret Gordon, a librarian's librarian at the University of California, Santa Cruz, with thanks." The book was authored by Amanda Quick, one of Krentz's many pen names.<br>
<br>
Krentz's thanks are for Gordon's research on the historical setting of the book. "Jayne is a former librarian and she's very meticulous about creating an accurate setting for her historical romances," Gordon says. Gordon provided Krentz with information on the Vauxhall Gardens--the pleasure gardens of 18th-century Regency England--and the young dandies, known as "macaronis," who used to frequent the gardens.<br>
<br>
Krentz has maintained a relationship with the university since graduating in 1970 from Stevenson College with a B.A. in history. She and Gordon have been in regular contact for a number of years and, in 1997, Krentz and her husband, Frank, established the Castle Humanities Endowment to support the acquisition of books in humanities-related subjects, a fund which they supplement each year. Krentz also returned to UCSC in 1996 to speak on romance novels as a literary genre (Krentz is the author of an award-winning critical volume, <i>Dangerous Men and Adventurous Women: Romance Writers on the Appeal of the Romance).</i><br>
<br>
<i>The Wicked Widow</i> was # 11 on the <i>New York Times</i> best-seller list for the week of April 24 and was written up that same week in <i>People</i> magazine. But, apparently, this is only the beginning. "If you think there are a lot of books out with your name on it now, just wait until the paperback rollover hits this time next spring," Krentz told Gordon. "There will be over a million copies in print in the paperback version. You'll be in every airport terminal in the country."

<p>
  Heirloom varieties of chile peppers that date back to the 1500s are among the special plants being featured at this year's UCSC Farm & Garden spring plant sale on Saturday and Sunday, May 6-7. Hours are 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. each day in the Barn Theater parking lot at the intersection of Bay and High Streets at the base of campus.
</p>The plant sale features a wide selection of organically raised plants, including more than 200 species of vegetables, flowers, landscape plants, herbs, and "everlastings," or dried flowers. All plants are proven to grow well in the local area.<br>
<br>
Known as land race peppers, this year's featured varieties of chile peppers have been cultivated in the Native American pueblos of Arizona and New Mexico since the 1500s, according to Orin Martin, manager of the Alan Chadwick Garden at UCSC. Some of these varieties bear the names of the pueblos that grew them originally, including Chimayo, Isleta, Jemez, Santo Domingo, and San Felipe. Today, most pueblo residents have abandoned the crop, and the future of these varieties is uncertain. Land race peppers are historically and horticulturally distinct from showier hybrids, maturing to a brilliant black-tinted red even in cool summers such as Santa Cruz experienced in 1998 and 1999.<br>
<br>
All varieties feature short plants that need no staking and are loaded with small, somewhat crooked, crescent-shaped red pods with thin skins and a subtly sweet flavor and moderate to spicy heat that often varies among pods on an individual plant.<br>
<br>
"My strong feeling is that it is an honor to plant these varieties, and no doubt if you plant them with joy, they will grow for you," said Martin.<br>
<br>
Land race varieties that will be available at the plant sale in three-inch pots for $1.50 each include:
<ul>
  <li>Chimayo: Tasty 4-5" pods are traditionally strung into ristras.
  </li>
  <li>Escondido: A hot/sweet chile from New Mexico; fruits are 2-5" long.
  </li>
  <li>Isleta: A medium hot chile with sweet and smoky undertones; traditionally grown near Albuquerque, New Mexico; used for ristras and chile powder.
  </li>
  <li>Jemez: From the Jemez Pueblo along the Rio Jemez, a tributary of the Rio Grande; medium hot chiles are 4-5" long.
  </li>
  <li>San Felipe: Grown with irrigation along the Rio Grande in northern New Mexico; bears medium hot fruits that are 5" long.
  </li>
  <li>Santo Domingo: From northern New Mexico, these 3-4" pod chiles are hot and often dried and strung into ristras, then ground into chile powder.
  </li>
  <li>Zia Pueblo: A typical New Mexico native chile, about 2" long, hot to mildly sweet and thin fleshed, with many seeds.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <br>
  Other hot/mild peppers that will be available are Big Chile, Casados, Chilaca, Coban, Del Arbol, Delicias, Early Jalapeno, Negro, Nu Mex Joe Parker, Super Chile, Super Serrano, Thai Dragon, Tobasco, Vallero, and Yellow and Red Cayenne. Sweet peppers for sale are Antohi Romanian, Cascabella, Corno di Toro, Czech Black, Gypsy, Kolasca, Lipstick, Paprika Supreme, Quatro D'Oro, and Valencia.<br>
  <br>
  Among the lovely perennials that will be available are columbine, coral bells, statice, Japanese anemone, blue globe thistle, and cupid's dart. The flower selection will include a wide variety of lavenders, salvias, sunflowers, yarrows, zinnias, alstroemeria, roses, and penstemons.<br>
  <br>
  The vegetable selection includes six-packs of salad mix, lettuces, broccoli, cauliflower, Asian greens, and an array of tomatoes, including Early Girl, Camp Joy cherry, Orange Sungold, Crimson, Carmello, Pink Brandywine, and Dona.<br>
  <br>
  Medicinal and culinary herbs will also be available, including echinacea, lemon verbena, pineapple sage, French tarragon, rosemary, and several varieties of basil, mint, sage, thyme, and oregano. A full list of plants that will be available at the sale can be found on the Web, with the list of perennials followed by annuals, at: <a href="http://zzyx.ucsc.edu/casfs/">http://zzyx.ucsc.edu/casfs/</a><br>
  <br>
  Sponsored by the Friends of the Farm & Garden and the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems, the sale will benefit the UCSC Apprenticeship in Ecological Horticulture. Members of the Friends will receive early entry (from 9 to 10 a.m. each morning) and a 10 percent discount on purchases; memberships will be available at the sale beginning at 8:30 a.m. For more information, call (831) 459-3240.

<p>
  Professor of theater arts Kathy Foley, chair of the Theater Arts Department and provost of Porter College, has been appointed to hold UCSC's Chandra Bhandari Endowed Chair in India Studies--one of the country's few endowed chairs in India studies and a cornerstone to the campus's burgeoning program in South Asia studies.
</p>Foley, who will serve as chairholder through the spring of 2001, is a respected scholar in the field of Indian and Southeast Asian dance and theater. Her areas of research include the arts and culture of India. Foley received a Ph.D. in Asian theater from the University of Hawaii, where she specialized in Indonesian puppet theater. She studied the dance art of Tamil Nadu in the l970s and conducted research as a Fulbright scholar on the impact of Indian arts and culture on the German Romantic movement. Her recent research has focused on interconnections between South and Southeast Asian performance and visual iconography and has resulted in exhibitions on South and Southeast Asian puppets and Vietnamese water puppets.<br>
<br>
The Bhandari Chair was established by Silicon Valley entrepreneur Narpat Bhandari in honor of his wife, Chandra, in 1997. Since its inception, the chair has supported a number of important events, including two international conferences that have brought scholars together from around the world to examine India's economy and the art and culture of India, as well as a visit to India by a campus delegation, which has sewn the seeds for a variety of multidisciplinary collaborations between UCSC and institutions in India.<br>
<br>
In announcing the appointment, UC Santa Cruz Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood said, "I am delighted to announce the appointment of Professor Foley to the Bhandari Chair. Professor Foley is a respected leader at UCSC with a deep regard for and understanding of South and Southeast Asian arts and culture. Under her leadership, this program will serve as a bridge between the university and the community at large, supporting activities that promote an understanding of India and drawing upon the rich resources of the area's active Indian community as well."<br>
<br>
"Additionally," Greenwood said, "we are grateful to Narpat and Chandra Bhandari for establishing this endowed chair. Their gift represents a cornerstone to our South Asia Studies Initiative and has already served as a catalyst for exceptional scholarly and cultural activities in India studies on a local, regional, and international level."<br>
<br>
"I am very pleased with the appointment of Professor Foley," said Narpat Bhandari. "I am confident that she will further our vision to establish UCSC as an international focal point for India studies that can support interdisciplinary collaborations with academic and nonacademic colleagues around the world."<br>
<br>
Foley plans to generate multidisciplinary activities drawing on campus, community, and international resources. "I am looking forward to working collaboratively with the Indian community in the Santa Cruz-San Jose area," she said. "I would like to build programming that allows students to interact with the community to learn about the rich history of Indian culture and also to understand its important contributions to American culture, economy, and the arts."<br>
<br>
Foley has already initiated several activities, which are supported by the Bhandari Chair. Among them are:
<ul>
  <li>A course in modern Indian history, taught by visiting Indian scholar Dr. Rudrangshu Mukherjee. Mukherjee is affiliated with the Subaltern Studies Collective and is a member of the History Department at Calcutta University. He is also editorial page editor of a leading English-language daily in India.
  </li>
  <li>A residency and performance by Natya Griha Kathakali, a professional Kathakali troupe from India. The residency on the South Indian dance/drama form for UCSC students will culminate in a free public performance on Wednesday, May 3, at 8 p.m. in the Theater Arts Second Stage. For information, call 831/459-2787.
  </li>
  <li>On Thursday and Friday, June 1 and 2, at 8 p.m., Foley and Irawati Durban, a prominent Indonesian dancer, will present a lecture and performance on "Islamic Aspects of the Indian Diaspora." The event is free and open to the public and takes place in the Theater Arts Second Stage. For more information, call 831/459-2787.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <br>
  Plans for future Bhandari Chair activities include a lecture series featuring noted Indian scholars; a course on Indian philosophy and religion and a course on Indian performance, both to be taught in the 2000-01 academic year; and conferences on the influence of India on economics, humanities, and arts.<br>
  <br>
  Narpat and Chandra Bhandari, longtime entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley, were both born in India. Chandra Bhandari has worked in the field of education since 1965 as both a Montessori teacher and a volunteer. Narpat Bhandari is an Angel Investor and chairman and CEO of Vanguard Systems, Inc., a pre-IPO electronics firm in Santa Clara, California. He also serves as an adviser and/or boardmember of several electronics companies. He is a trustee of the UC Santa Cruz Foundation and cofounder and a director of The Indus Entrepreneurs (TiE) of Santa Clara.

<p>
  <img align="right" border="0" height="135" src="../art/talamantes.125.jpg" width="125" alt="">The American Physiological Society (APS) has invited professor of biology Frank Talamantes to present the Solomon A. Berson Distinguished Lecture at the society's annual meeting in 2001. This lectureship, the highest honor awarded by the APS's Endocrinology and Metabolism Section, is in recognition of his major accomplishments in the field of hormones and their receptors. The award includes a $1,000 honorarium and up to $2,000 to cover travel expenses.<br>
  <br>
  Talamantes, a prominent endocrinologist, has done pioneering research on a family of hormones called placental lactogens and on the growth hormone receptor. The placental lactogens and the growth hormone receptor are proteins that play crucial roles during pregnancy. Talamantes and his laboratory colleagues have elucidated the structures of these proteins and their genes. They have also investigated the factors involved in modulating their expression during pregnancy and the effects of placental lactogens on target organs such as the mammary gland. In addition, Talamantes is working to understand the protective effect that pregnancy has against breast cancer.

        <title>UCSC teams up with The Nature Conservancy to study and protect coastal waters</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_8768" align="alignright" width="167"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/04/beck_michael.00-04-24.167.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-8768" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/04/beck_michael.00-04-24.167.jpg" alt="Michael Beck" width="167" height="171" /></a>Michael Beck[/caption]
<p>
  A new partnership between UCSC and The Nature Conservancy aims to put the best available scientific information to work in the area of marine conservation and management. A cooperative agreement signed last month provides the foundation for an effective working relationship between the Institute of Marine Sciences (IMS) and the Conservancy's Coastal Waters Program, said IMS director Gary Griggs.
</p>"The Nature Conservancy can help us in our efforts to understand the biology of marine environments, and it also provides an urgently needed conduit to export this knowledge and apply it in marine conservation and management," Griggs said.<br>
<br>
The Nature Conservancy, a private international conservation organization, focuses on preserving habitats and species by protecting the lands and waters they need to survive. The organization currently manages 1,340 preserves around the globe, the largest system of private nature sanctuaries in the world, including more than a million acres in the United States alone.<br>
<br>
Griggs said he was impressed by The Nature Conservancy's emphasis on scientific research as a foundation for its strategies. The Conservancy uses information on the distribution and abundance of species, as well as other kinds of ecological data, to guide the management of its preserves, to identify and monitor threats, and to decide which sites need protection.<br>
<br>
"Good scientific information from ecologists and biologists is integral to our work, and I think this is a great opportunity to get topflight researchers together with a large conservation organization with a strong scientific basis," said Michael Beck, director of marine science for the Conservancy's Coastal Waters Program.<br>
<br>
Beck has set up an office on campus, where he plans to establish a modest research program, and has been meeting with IMS researchers. He expects to have opportunities for interns and research assistants, and may also serve on graduate student committees and do a limited amount of teaching.<br>
<br>
Until fairly recently, most of the Conservancy's efforts in the United States have been aimed at terrestrial species and habitats, although it has had marine conservation programs in the Caribbean and Asia-Pacific regions and in the Florida Keys for many years, Beck said. The Coastal Waters Program was created to help the Conservancy and its partners develop a better understanding of marine organisms and ecosystems and more effective strategies for their conservation.<br>
<br>
"There was a growing realization that we were missing a lot of biodiversity by focusing on terrestrial species," said Beck, who serves as a link between researchers and field staff.<br>
<br>
"My responsibilities are to connect with people who can provide us with information on the distribution and abundance of marine species and the ecological processes that impact them, and to help develop scientifically informed strategies for their conservation. There are great studies being done by UCSC scientists, and I want to get that information to our field staff on the ground (and increasingly in the water) at our field sites," Beck said.<br>
<br>
In recent years, the Conservancy has begun to shift its focus away from individual species and their habitats toward the protection of entire landscapes and ecosystems. This strategy is forcing the organization to deal increasingly with issues on the cutting edge of ecological research, Beck said.<br>
<br>
He noted that UCSC researchers are involved in several projects relating to marine reserves and how ecological theory should be used to design and manage them. Marine biologists Peter Raimondi and Mark Carr, for example, are leading UCSC's participation in the Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans (PISCO), a five-year, $17.7 million project looking at the coastal environment and ecosystems from Oregon to southern California. Part of PISCO's mission is to communicate its findings to the public so that the findings can be used to develop sound policies.<br>
<br>
"That kind of communication happens all too infrequently. Through this relationship with UCSC, we hope to provide more pathways for information to move out of the university, and we hope to find more opportunities for funding to support collaborations between the people doing research and the people applying it," Beck said.<br>
<br>
With staff working at hundreds of field sites around the world, there are likely to be opportunities for the Conservancy to provide support for UCSC scientists conducting field research, Beck said. In addition, the Conservancy has just established a research program that will support 25 postdoctoral fellows over the next five years to work at Conservancy sites.<br>
<br>
"The impetus for this program was that all too often our field staff are unaware of relevant ecological research, and many researchers are unaware of how their studies can address the most pressing problems in conservation. We want to bring these groups into closer contact," Beck said.<br>
<br>
The Nature Conservancy has established partnerships with other academic institutions as well, including UC Davis, the University of Florida, and Cornell University. At UC Davis, the partnership focuses on the problem of invasive exotic plant species.

        <title>Arboretum and California Native Plant Society intertwine for Spring Plant Sale</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_8763" align="alignright" width="200"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/04/plantsale.00-04-24.200.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-8763" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/04/plantsale.00-04-24.200.jpg" alt="Leucadendron discolor "Pom Pom" blooms in late spring to early summer and is fairly easy to grow." width="200" height="150" /></a>Leucadendron discolor "Pom Pom" blooms in late spring to early summer and is fairly easy to grow.[/caption]
<p>
  Curator of Succulents, Arboretum The UCSC Arboretum is holding its annual Spring Plant Sale in conjunction with the California Native Plant Society Sale on Saturday, April 29, from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. The sale will take place at the Arboretum Eucalyptus Grove on High Street near the intersection with Western Drive.
</p>A South African "Pom Pom," an Australian shrub with crimson flowers eight inches wide, and California native plants highlight this year's offerings by the two prominent horticultural organizations. The annual Spring Plant Sale brings gardeners and nursery buyers from as far away as Sonoma and Santa Barbara.<br>
<br>
One of the most sought-after plants at the Arboretum in recent years is <i>Leucadendron discolor</i> "Pom Pom," which will be among the new offerings at this year's sale. This <i>Leucadendron</i> is a selection made in South Africa and imported to Santa Cruz in 1994. It is a male plant with cheerful, bright-red pollen "cones" surrounded by white to pale-yellow, petal-like bracts. According to Protea grower Dennis Perry, "Pom Pom" is the best selection of the large-flowered, long-stemmed <i>Leucadendron discolor</i> and makes a wonderful cut flower. It requires acidic, well-drained soil, sun, and protection from hard frost. "Pom Pom" will grow to about seven feet tall, but Perry and the Arboretum recommend hard pruning at the time of flower harvest to maintain the vigor of the plant and to control its size. This showy, drought-tolerant <i>Leucadendron</i> blooms in late spring to early summer and is fairly easy to grow.<br>
<br>
The sale will also feature a brand new manzanita from northern Monterey County: <i>Arctostaphylos pajaronensis</i> "Brett's Beauty," grown by Sierra Azul Nursery. It was named after Brett Hall, the Arboretum's assistant director, who made the original selection. Another California native that will be available is a barbless barberry from Santa Cruz Island. The plants, which are extremely rare in the wild, are being propagated at the Arboretum and distributed to botanic gardens and to the public to increase the number in cultivation.<br>
<br>
Among the other offerings is <i>Telopea,</i> an Australian shrub with huge red flowers that is the floral emblem for the state of New South Wales. It grows well in light shade. <i>Eutaxia obovata</i> "Dwarf Form" is a wild-looking pea plant, a small shrub with apricot-yellow petals, red centers, and hebe-like foliage.<br>
<br>
There should also be plenty of Protea, Banksia, pincushion Protea, and kangaroo paw plants available from the Arboretum. The California Native Plant Society will be offering choice iris species and other natives, including bleeding hearts, stream orchids, and coral bells.<br>
<br>
The Arboretum specializes in plants not readily available in nurseries. Several of <i>Sunset</i> magazine's "best of the new plants" have been selections made or imported by the Arboretum staff. At the Arboretum's plant sales, the public has the opportunity to buy selections that may be on the "best of the new plants" lists several years from now. Several local nurseries, such as California Succulents, Monterey Bay Nursery, Sierra Azul, and Suncrest Nursery, often donate additional plants to the sale.<br>
<br>
The sale will be open to Arboretum and CNPS members only from 10 to 11 a.m. and to the general public from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Nonmembers may join the Arboretum Associates on the day of the sale.<br>
<br>
Visitors are welcome to tour the gardens and see the abundant hummingbirds while they are at the Arboretum. The Arboretum is open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. every day. Norrie's Gifts is open Tuesday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. and Sunday from 1 to 4 p.m. The Jean and Bill Lane Horticultural Library is open Wednesday through Sunday from 1 to 4 p.m.

        <title>Anthropologist chronicles stunning transformation of Christian fundamentalism</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_8761" align="alignright" width="180"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/04/harding.falwel.00-04-17.180.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-8761" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/04/harding.falwel.00-04-17.180.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="277" /></a>[/caption]
<p>
  Over the years, anthropologist Susan Harding fielded a lot of questions about her work on Jerry Falwell and American Christian fundamentalism in the 1980s, but one in particular resonated throughout her research: "Are they dumb, stupid, or just plain ignorant?"
</p>Questions can be so revealing, and that one--from a fellow academic--encapsulated for Harding the disrespect and disregard that so many people have for born-again Christians. It also served as a constant reminder of Harding's role, first as a researcher and then as an author, diving into the world of modern Protestant fundamentalism and, in essence, "reporting back" to her colleagues and the public.<br>
<br>
The result of that years-long effort is Harding's new book, <i>The Book of Jerry Falwell: Fundamentalist Language and Politics</i> (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 2000). Despite her colleague's swift dismissal of Bible-believing Christians, Harding found that Jerry Falwell and his fellow preachers masterminded the stunning transformation of "stay-at-home" Christian separatists into a daunting force that has forever changed this country's cultural and political landscape.<br>
<br>
"For most of the 20th century, fundamentalists were in self-imposed exile," said Harding. "They were separatists who shunned the secular world as profane and corrupt."<br>
<br>
But the 1980s marked a dramatic reversal, during which the definition of "good Christian" became synonymous with "engagement" at all levels of secular society, including politics, which was perhaps the most visible--though far from the only--landscape to be transformed by the shift.<br>
<br>
"They weren't merely interested in affecting conventional politics, but in altering all of society," said Harding. "One preacher I spoke with used words like 'infiltration' and 'guerrilla warfare' when he described the church's goal of transforming society."<br>
<br>
Indeed, believers were urged to enter professions like teaching and health care, where they could fight for the teaching of creationism and against the growing euthanasia movement. Nurses were called on to "blow the whistle" on doctors performing late-term abortions. Believers were encouraged to join the entertainment industry where they could influence the content of movies and television shows.<br>
<br>
Far less visibly than high-profile leaders like Jerry Falwell and Jimmy Swaggart, thousands of preachers around the country mobilized their congregations, and the results have been dramatic, said Harding. "This was not a one-time episode," emphasizes Harding. "This shift in engagement has had a powerful and lasting impact on all of American society."<br>
<br>
Falwell and other leaders, including televangelists like Jim Bakker, received widespread media exposure in the 1980s that contributed to an impression of unity and size that did not accurately reflect Christian fundamentalism at the time, said Harding. Those impressions scared the opposition, but more importantly, they helped Christians see themselves as a national force before they had actually become one. By the late 1980s, following a wave of scandals that washed over several prominent fundamentalist leaders, media coverage died down and liberals began to dismiss born-again Christians as off-center oddities. Though their visibility has faded, nothing could be further from the truth, said Harding.<br>
<br>
"As founder of the Moral Majority, Falwell urged his followers to become full participants in public and political discourse," said Harding. "In doing so, he and his colleagues transformed American fundamentalists from a group of marginal separatists into a vocal political and cultural force. With 50 million Americans describing themselves as born-again Christians today, fundamentalists make up one of the most powerful forces in our country."<br>
<br>
In her book, Harding examines the complex changes in the language of the fundamentalist movement, focusing on the words of preachers and leaders in sermons, speeches, pamphlets, books, television broadcasts, and conferences. It was through their use of the Bible's language, Harding asserts in the book, that Falwell and his co-pastors molded their churches into "a living sequel to the Bible."<br>
<br>
"Bible-based language is very persuasive, and it produces effects," said Harding, who visited Falwell's ministry in Lynchburg, Virginia, a half-dozen times during the 1980s. By studying the complexity and creativity of "born-again language," Harding was able to reveal the social force and consequences of born-again language.<br>
<br>
"Falwell and his colleagues used language in a way that enabled believers to understand their cultural and political transformation in the 1980s as if it flowed directly from the Bible and therefore from God," said Harding. "Language is the medium through which born-again Christians are formed and reformed, and the reformation that took place in the 1980s will resonate in our society for a very long time."

        <title>Hitting a workout slump? Time to work harder, says director</title>

<p>
  Like most fitness converts, Katrina Cope has hit a slump. After making dramatic progress during her first two months of weight training at the campus's new Wellness Center, her improvement has suddenly slowed. Cope is feeling encouraged by the growing strength in her legs and some lost inches, but she isn't continuing to make gains she'd hoped for in upper-body strength.
</p>"You know how you have 'on' days and 'off' days? Well, it seemed like lately I have been having more 'off' days. I am not progressively moving up in the weights I was using, particularly for upper-body exercises" said Cope.<br>
<br>
No problem, said Ryan Andrews, manager of the Wellness Center and Cope's instructor during twice-weekly lunch-hour "Express Workouts." Hitting a plateau is common after two to three months of a new workout program, he said.<br>
<br>
"Physiologically, when you're lifting weights, you get to a point where you need to do something different to continue making progress," explained Andrews. Fortunately, the solution is straightforward. In Cope's case, Andrews recommends increased attention and concentration during her workouts, and a follow-up evaluation to assess whether she is working at full capacity.<br>
<br>
"One of the most common mistakes with beginners is they learn the motion of the exercise, but they don't know why they're doing it. They don't know what muscles they're working," said Andrews. Consequently, it's easy to slip into what he calls "robot mode," simply going through the motions without focusing on specific muscles.<br>
<br>
"Most of us have stressful jobs, and we come in here to turn off our minds, but you need to stay focused on what you're doing," said Andrews. "It's like anything else. If you turn your mind off, you'll stop pushing yourself and getting the maximum benefit out of the exercise."<br>
<br>
Armed with this advice, Cope has begun approaching her workouts with greater awareness. And she has already noticed a difference.<br>
<br>
"Ryan told me to concentrate on the individual muscle groups and not just zone out. Today while slightly increasing the weight on several pieces of the exercise equipment, I concentrated on the particular muscle group that machine works" said Cope. "We'll see if I'm sore tonight."<br>
<br>
Cope has discovered that it helps to close her eyes while lifting weights. "Then I'm not distracted by what other people are doing or what's happening outside," said Cope, adding that despite her recent frustrations, her workouts have gotten easier over the weeks, even as she is lifting more weight than ever before.<br>
<br>
"The workout goes by faster now," she said. "Before, I used to think, 'Oh no, we have to do another round?,' but now I realize I'm thinking, 'It's over already?'" The publicity of being followed in <i>Currents</i> has bolstered Cope's commitment to her workout routine. "I feel compelled to continue. I'll be publicly disgraced if I don't do it!" she joked.<br>
<br>
Next in store for Cope is a session with Andrews to evaluate whether she is really pushing herself to full capacity. "After a few months, you need to up the ante a bit," said Andrews. "As you get further along, improvement will come in smaller increments. There's no question she'll continue to improve, both in strength and how she feels. She just needs to get over this plateau."<br>
<br>
<hr>
<p>
  <b>Fitness Tip:</b> An ideal workout routine includes two days a week of weight training and at least three days a week of cardiovascular activity. Workouts should be a minimum of 20 minutes each. "Longer is better," said Andrews. "If you find an activity you like, you'll want to do it for an hour."

<p>
  A large crowd gathered April 13 to celebrate the winners of the 34th annual Book Collection Contest. The contest, which is sponsored by the Friends of the UCSC Library, has three sections: one for UCSC students, one for area high school students in 9th and 10th grades, and one for area high school students in 11th and 12th grades. In each category there is a first- second- and third-place winner (this year, at the high school level, there was a tie in one of the third-place categories and an honorable mention).
</p>Contest entrants at the university level are eligible only if they actually own a collection of 25 or more books, but high school students need only imagine their collection--describing a set of books and other materials that reflects a passionate interest. Contest entrants submit a bibliography and an essay describing the special value of their collection. The high school students need only imagine a collection that reflects a passionate interest and submit an annotated bibliography and an essay describing the special value of their collection. The winners' collections and winning essays are on display at the McHenry Library at UCSC.<br>
<br>
At the awards ceremony winners were awarded a certificate, cash prizes, and the high school students also received a bookstore gift certificate for use by their high school library.<br>
<br>
Also at the awards ceremony, the Friends of the UCSC Library dedicated a bench in memory of Candy Coonerty who was a Friends board member and a great supporter of the library.<br>

</p>
<p>
  Growing apples the new, old-fashioned way--organically--just got a whole lot easier for this important California crop. Recently available from the University of California is the <i>Organic Apple Production Manual,</i> a concise, 72-page compendium of more than 20 years of state-of-the-art UC research and grower experience.<br>
  <br>
</p>"This is an indispensable resource for current or potential producers of organic apples," said coauthor Sean L. Swezey, associate director of UCSC's Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems and director of the Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education Program (SAREP). "Modern apple production is a highly technical undertaking to begin with. Producing apples organically requires even more vigilance and ingenuity to deal effectively with pest control, soil fertility, and postharvest handling and other management challenges."<br>
<br>
The manual covers a review of the organic apple industry, including trends in production and markets, supply and price, certification requirements, and other state and federal regulations. Individual chapters explore orchard management, disease and pest management, harvest and postharvest operations, marketing considerations, and economic performance. Published by the UC Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources (ANR), the <i>Organic Apple Production Manual</i> is illustrated with 20 color photographs and 19 tables, contains an extensive index, and lists a comprehensive bibliography of related publications for apple growers.<br>
<br>
Organic and conventional growers alike will find a wealth of information on issues of common concern. Conventional growers considering the transition to organic production and certification will learn why it's important to make the shift carefully and incrementally. Guidelines on what records to keep, who to contact, and what to expect during the transition are also included.<br>
<br>
Many of the basic agronomic practices are the same for both organic and conventional apple production systems. These are well documented in two other ANR publications--<i>Commercial Apple Growing in California</i> (ANR Publication 2456) and <i>Integrated Pest Management for Apples and Pears,</i> 2nd edition (ANR Publication 3340). Together with the <i>Organic Apple Production Manual</i> these publications comprise an essential reference kit necessary for anyone considering organic apple production.<br>
<br>
California is emerging as one of the nation's leading apple producers with approximately 10 percent of the total, exceeded only by Washington state. The increase is due in large part to plantings of Granny Smith and Fuji varieties in the San Joaquin Valley during the last 15 years. Of the roughly 36,000 acres of apples grown in California, a small but increasingly significant percentage are grown organically. The future is bright for this growing market segment. Demand for organically grown apples has increased since the Alar scare of 1989. Many supermarkets responded then by adding organically grown apples and they're a staple in consumer cooperatives, natural food stores, specialty produce stores, farmers' markets, and other direct-marketing outlets.

<p>
  For the third time in five years, a graduate of UC Santa Cruz has received a <a href="http://www.pulitzer.org">Pulitzer Prize</a>, journalism's most prestigious honor. Among the winners announced April 10 is Martha Mendoza, who won the prize for investigative journalism as part of an Associated Press team.
</p>In a special report published last year, Mendoza and reporters Sang-Hun Choe and Charles J. Hanley told a chilling story of U.S. soldiers gunning down hundreds of South Korean civilians--many of them women and children--in the early weeks of the Korean War. The killings took place in July 1950 under a railroad bridge near the hamlet No Gun Ri. (View the interactive Associated Press Special Report: <a href="http://wire.ap.org/APpackages/nogunri">Bridge at No Gun Ri.</a>)
<p>
  Based on hundreds of interviews the AP team conducted with South Korean survivors and ex-GIs, the coverage prompted the U.S. military and the South Korean government to agree to review the allegations. The massacre at No Gun Ri has been called one of only two cases of large-scale killing of noncombatants by U.S. ground troops in the 20th century; the other was Vietnam's My Lai in 1968, in which more than 500 Vietnamese were alleged to have been killed.
</p>
<p>
  A Pulitzer Prize carries a cash award of $5,000.
</p>
<p>
  Besides the Pulitzer Prize, the No Gun Ri story has won numerous awards, including the highly regarded <a href="http://www.liunet.edu/cwis/bklyn/polk/prev99.html">George Polk Award</a> for international reporting. "As we win prizes, it is not something to celebrate," Mendoza said. "We wrote about people dying and I'm trying to really keep that on the forefront. This is about the death of a lot of people."
</p>
<p>
  Mendoza, a 1988 graduate who designed her own major in journalism and education, was affiliated with UCSC's Kresge College. She is a visiting lecturer on campus this quarter, teaching a journalism class through UCSC's Writing Program.
</p>
<p>
  Mendoza is the third UCSC graduate to receive a Pulitzer; Laurie Garrett and Annie Wells received the coveted award in 1996 and 1997, respectively.
</p>
<p>
  Garrett (Merrill College '75), writing as a science and medical reporter for <i>Newsday,</i> received the Pulitzer Prize for explanatory journalism. The award recognized her series of articles about the May 1995 outbreak of the deadly ebola virus in Zaire. Garrett earned a B.A. in biology and spent eight years as a science correspondent at National Public Radio. In February 1996, she received the Alumni Achievement Award from UCSC's Alumni Association in recognition of her career accomplishments.
</p>
<p>
  Wells (College Eight '81), working as a photographer for the <i>Santa Rosa Press Democrat,</i> received a Pulitzer for spot news photography. The award recognized her dramatic photograph, carried in newspapers across the country, of a local firefighter rescuing a teenager from raging floodwaters. Wells's interest in photography began at UCSC in 1979 when she designed her own major of science news writing and photojournalism.

<p>
  Angela Oh, a civil rights attorney and former member of President Clinton's Initiative on Race advisory panel, will give a free public talk about race and politics in the new century on Thursday, April 27, at 8 p.m. in the Stevenson Dining Hall at UC Santa Cruz. Her talk is entitled, "The Politics of Possibilities: Race and Politics in the New Century."<br>
  <br>
</p>Oh, a former criminal defense attorney, is a leading figure in the public discussion of issues related to race, diversity, and the future of American society. Serving on the president's advisory panel, which has submitted its report to Clinton, changed Oh's life.<br>
<br>
"There aren't any silver bullets when it comes to race relations," she has said, but continued discussion is critical, particularly as voters in states like California deal with changing demographics by attacking affirmative action and bilingual education. Oh, a self-described beneficiary of affirmative action, is a defender of affirmative action in higher education and other arenas.<br>
<br>
Oh is an instructor at UC Irvine, where she is currently teaching a course on race, politics, and policy. She is also a member of the Los Angeles City Human Relations Commission and works with the Asian Pacific American Women's Leadership Institute, the California Commission on Access to Justice, and the Western Justice Center Foundation.<br>
<br>
Her UCSC talk is sponsored by the UCSC Asian American/Pacific Islander Resource Center, Educational Opportunity Programs, Services to Students of Color, the UCSC Women's Center, and the Women's Studies Department.

  A 15-part BBC television series called "California Bay," focusing on marine life and research around Monterey Bay, featured several UCSC marine scientists, including biologists <b>Terrie Williams</b> and <b>Baldo Marinovic,</b> geologist <b>Gary Griggs,</b> head dolphin trainer <b>Billy Hurley,</b> and many of the student volunteers who help care for resident dolphins <b>Primo</b> and <b>Puka</b> at Long Marine Laboratory.<br>
  <br>
  The <i>Santa Cruz County Sentinel</i> ran a story about astrophysicist <b>Stan Woosley's</b> theory regarding the origins of gamma ray bursts.<br>
  <br>
  Earth sciences researcher <b>Erik Asphaug's</b> research on asteroid impacts was included in an article about asteroids in the <i>New York Times.</i><br>
  <br>
  The work of associate professor of mathematics <b>Richard Montgomery</b> was featured in the magazines <i>Science News</i> and <i>Science.</i> Montgomery's novel solution of the "three-body problem"--the 300-year-old conundrum of understanding how three planets or stars move under each other's mutual gravitational attraction--showed that the orbits of a trio of stars bound by gravity could trace a figure-eight pattern through space.

<p>
  An important exhibit on anti-Semitism currently on display in Sacramento's Golden State Museum includes the compelling story of a UCSC Foundation board member, told through the very personal medium of letters, personal artifacts, and documents from Nazi-dominated Europe.<br>
  <br>
</p>The main exhibit is titled "Anti-Semitism, Past and Present: Images from a History of Prejudice," and presents a comprehensive picture of ten centuries of hatred against Jews. The companion exhibit--"A Personal Perspective on the Holocaust: The Neufeld Family"--features items from the Neufeld Family Archive, donated to the University Library's Special Collections in 1995 by UCSC Foundation trustee and former president Anne Neufeld Levin.<br>
<br>
The Golden State Museum opened in 1998 as the official home of the California State Archives. Along with special exhibits, the museum displays items from its vast collections concerning immigration, landscape, geology, politics, and more.<br>
<br>
"Anti-Semitism, Past and Present" was originally commissioned by the government of Holland and the Dutch Reform Church and was created by the curator of the Anne Frank House. The current exhibition, organized by the Anti-Defamation League, is the only scheduled appearance in northern California. "Anti-Semitism, Past and Present" runs through April 21, while the exhibit of the Neufeld Family Archive continues through May 14. For more information, call the museum at (916) 653-7524 or visit <a href="http://www.ss.ca.gov/museum/museuminfo.htm">the Golden State Museum Web site</a>.<br>
<br>
When they were planning the exhibition, curators of the Golden State Museum sought out the Neufeld Family Archive as the perfect companion piece to present a personal picture of the effects of anti-Semitism. They have selected items from the archive to present a moving and vivid re-creation of the story of Levin's family who, like millions of others Jews in the last century, suffered Nazi persecution. Levin fled from Austria with her parents, Henry and Hedy Neufeld, at the age of three; but many of her relatives did not escape. The current exhibit presents the story of the Neufeld family in three stages--documenting their early years in Austria, followed by their experiences as the Nazis rose to power, and finally, telling what became of the family, from those who did not survive to those, like Levin, who miraculously escaped.<br>
<br>
In 1995, Levin established <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/press_releases/archive/94-95/05-95/051995-World_War_II_surviv.html">the Neufeld-Levin Chair in Holocaust Studies</a>, an endowed chair to support ongoing examination of the Holocaust. Levin, a longtime UCSC supporter, established the library archive at the same time with the conviction that a donation establishing an endowed chair should be supplemented by a gift of related library materials to support research and other activities generated by the chair.<br>
<br>
Levin was honored as a featured speaker at two events to commemorate the exhibition. The first, on March 27, was sponsored by the museum, the Anti-Defamation League, and California Secretary of State Bill Jones. The second event took place at Kenesset Israel Torah Center on April 11. Kenesset Israel was one of three temples in Sacramento to sustain extreme damage as the result of hate crimes targeting Jews in 1999. The featured speakers for that event were Levin and state Insurance Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_8740" align="alignright" width="180"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/04/jin_yishi.00-04-17.180.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-8740" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/04/jin_yishi.00-04-17.180.jpg" alt="Yishi Jin Photo: r. r. jones" width="180" height="238" /></a>Yishi Jin Photo: r. r. jones[/caption]
<p>
  Assistant professor of biology Yishi Jin is among a select group of young researchers to receive the 1999 Presidential Early Career Award for Scientists and Engineers. The award is the highest honor bestowed by the U.S. government on outstanding scientists and engineers who are in the early stages of establishing their independent research careers.
</p>Jin traveled to Washington, D.C., last week to accept the award in an April 12 White House ceremony.<br>
<br>
Jin studies the genetics of nervous system development. Most of her research is based on experiments with a tiny roundworm, <i>C. elegans,</i> known to molecular biologists as "the worm." The worm's nervous system consists of 302 interconnected nerve cells. The human brain, in contrast, contains at least one trillion nerve cells.<br>
<br>
"We have learned a lot about behavior from studying the human brain, but we know little about how its structure develops and how all the neural connections are made," Jin said.<br>
<br>
She has been identifying genes involved in creating the worm's relatively simple neural circuitry, and so far all of the genes she has found in the worm have turned out to have matching genes in humans and other organisms.<br>
<br>
Jin was among 20 researchers selected by the National Science Foundation to receive the Presidential Early Career Award. A total of 60 award winners from nine participating federal agencies were honored this year.<br>
<br>
"We expect that these promising scientists and engineers will one day become the leaders of this nation's research and education community," said NSF director Rita Colwell.<br>
<br>
This is the fourth year the Presidential Early Career Awards have been given. The Clinton administration established the awards in 1996 to recognize some of the nation's finest scientists and engineers and to maintain U.S. leadership across the frontiers of scientific research.

        <title>Major grant boosts Chicano/Latino Research Center and Latin American and Latino studies</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 17 Apr 2000 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>8739</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_8738" align="alignright" width="180"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/04/zavella_patric.00-04-17.180.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-8738" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/04/zavella_patric.00-04-17.180.jpg" alt="Patricia Zavella" width="180" height="193" /></a>Patricia Zavella[/caption]
<p>
  Who would guess that pop music superstar Ricky Martin embodies a phenomenon that is shaking up the intellectual roots of Latin American studies. But the fact that Martin is a hit with audiences in his native Puerto Rico, across Latin America, and in the United States is a shining example of the way in which traditional social and cultural borders are becoming blurred. That phenomenon has necessitated a "rethinking" of Latin American and Latino studies, and UCSC is at the forefront of a growing movement that is spreading throughout academia.
</p>UCSC's leadership role in broadening the scope of <a href="http://reg.ucsc.edu/catalog/lals/">Latin American and Latino studies</a> got a major endorsement recently from the Ford Foundation, which has awarded a $235,000 three-year grant to the Chicano/Latino Research Center and the Latin American and Latino studies program.<br>
<br>
The grant will fund a project designed to bring a greater "trans-border" focus to Latin American and Latino studies. Greater emphasis on cross-border issues is now essential as migration, globalization, and technology contribute to unprecedented social, cultural, economic, and political interaction between populations in the United States, Mexico, and all of Latin America, said Patricia Zavella, professor of community studies and one of the principal investigators on the new project.<br>
<br>
"We need to build bridges between Latin Americans and Latinos in the United States," said Zavella. "As an academic, if you're doing Latin American studies, you can't ignore what's happening here, and the same is true of Latino studies. You can't ignore what's happening across the border."<br>
<br>
Examples of interconnectedness are everywhere, said Zavella, who pointed to economic ties such as those forged by migrants from agricultural areas of Mexico who take farm jobs in the United States. When they send a portion of their earnings home, they are supporting the development of small-scale farms in Mexico and are contributing significantly to the economic development of their regions, said Zavella.
<p>
  Similar ties are evident in politics, where a proposal to extend voting rights to Mexicans living in the United States indicates the potential power to Mexican society represented by immigrants.
</p>
<p>
  Culturally, there is a vital exchange of popular culture between the United States and Latin America, including television shows, movies, and music, and Martin's success is indicative of the breakdown of traditional borders, said Zavella.<br>
  <br>
  The project, "Hemispheric Dialogues 2: Bridging Latin American and Latino/a Studies Through Curricular Innovation and Action-Research Partnerships," will strengthen alliances between community activists and scholars by supporting collaborations. It will also encourage the "rethinking" of courses by faculty and support the development of new courses by graduate students, said Zavella.<br>
  <br>
  "Bringing activists to campus enriches everyone," said Zavella, who has been working with San Francisco-based Xochitl Castaneda, an activist who is working to increase the availability of medical services to Guatemalan migrants in the Bay Area.<br>
  <br>
  "Our work on the vulnerability of migrant farmworker women to sexually transmitted infections has taught her a lot about how different Mexicans are from Guatemalans, and I've learned a lot about how different U.S.-born Chicanos are from Mexican migrants," said Zavella. "Working together has really enriched our analysis, and it has helped me to make my scholarship more useful to people working in these communities."<br>
  <br>
  On the curriculum front, Zavella, whose area of expertise is in Chicana/o studies, said she has to "rethink" the content of her courses to reflect changes in Latino communities in the U.S. "For example, it's not just Mexicans who live in the Mission district in San Francisco anymore," she said. "It's Mexicans, indigenous Guatemalans, El Salvadorans, and more. As a result of these new relations, Chicanos are changing their identities and culture."<br>
  <br>
  By supporting curriculum changes, the project will encourage advanced graduate students to contribute to innovations in the field of Latin American and Latina/o studies, said Zavella. Faculty mentors will help students develop materials and will advise them as they teach new courses for the first time. Such experiences provide valuable professional opportunities and will ultimately spread the innovative thinking that's at the heart of the project as graduates go on to get jobs at other colleges and universities, said Zavella.<br>
  <br>
  "This is a challenge, but it's very exciting," added Zavella. "On most campuses, Latin American studies is totally separate from Chicano studies, which is totally separate from Native American studies. It's very unusual that we have all of these subjects in one program here, and this funding is a prestigious endorsement of the value of our approach."<br>
  <br>
  Other UCSC faculty members participating in the project are associate professor of politics Sonia Alvarez, LALS associate professor and chair Jonathan Fox, LALS professor Manuel Pastor, and assistant professor of literature Juan Poblete.<br>
  <br>
  A campus-based visiting fellows program for activists will encourage intellectual collaboration with scholars. Faculty coordinators plan to wrap up the project by hosting a conference that will focus on the major lessons of both the activist-researcher partnerships and the curriculum development results. Key findings will be disseminated through an edited volume and a dedicated Web site, said Zavella.

  <font color="#003399">Robert Fairlie</font>
</h4>

<p>
  Robert Fairlie, assistant professor of economics, has received a grant from the Spencer Foundation for research on the flight of whites from public schools into private schools. Fairlie will use data from the National Educational Longitudinal Study (NELS) and a recently released confidential dataset from the National Center for Educational Statistics to explore unanswered questions related to "white flight," including
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Which whites are fleeing to private schools in response to minority schoolchildren?
  </li>
  <li>Is white flight stronger for high or low socioeconomic whites?
  </li>
  <li>What are the underlying causes of white flight?
  </li>
  <li>Is it due to racism, concerns over peer group effects, or other factors?
  </li>
  <li>Are advantaged minorities also fleeing from poor minorities?
  </li>
  <li>Are public schools with large concentrations of minority schoolchildren losing those minorities with the highest socioeconomic status and test scores to private schools?
  </li>
  <li>What impact does the phenomenon have on the racial and socioeconomic composition of students who remain in public schools?
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  The findings will have implications for understanding the potential effects of private school vouchers, increased public school choice, and busing on the racial and socioeconomic composition of the nation's public schools. Fairlie's grant was funded by a Spencer Foundation project that supports research on pressing educational issues.

<p>
  Postdoctoral researcher Ignacio Camarillo has received a 2000 Travel Grant Award from the Endocrine Society. He will use the $500 award to support his presentation of a research paper at the June meeting of the Endocrine Society in Toronto. Camarillo studies the role of reproductive hormones in breast cancer susceptibility in professor of biology Frank Talamantes's lab.

        <title>UCDC course on museums and memorials will look at what's on display--and what's not</title>

<p>
  When UCSC juniors and seniors go to Washington, D.C., as participants of the UCDC internship program, it's almost inevitable that they will visit some of the city's remarkable monuments and museums. But Paul Skenazy, UCSC's resident faculty member for the program this quarter, hopes his students will not only appreciate what they see, but also what they don't.<br>
  <br>
</p>Skenazy, a professor of American literature, is teaching a course titled <i>Memoirs and Memorials</i> as part of the UCDC program. "I'd like to see my students develop a critical awareness through this course so that when they enjoy a museum display they can look beyond what it seems to be about," Skenazy says. "I want them to be able to ask, What's missing? What choices did the curator make, and why? What are we meant to think when we tour the exhibit? What social pressures influence the message of the exhibit?"<br>
<br>
As an example, Skenazy mentions a past exhibit at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum. The 1995 exhibit was originally titled: "The Last Act: The Atomic Bomb and the End of World War II," but, following pressure from veterans' organizations and such congressional representatives as Nancy Kassenbaum, the large, interpretive exhibit was replaced by what Smithsonian Secretary I. Michael Heyman described as "a less complicated display." That display focused on the technology of the <i>Enola Gay</i>--the B-29 bomber used in the atomic mission that destroyed Hiroshima.<br>
<br>
"The exhibit originally addressed issues of racism and political strategy," Skenazy says. "Why choose to bomb Japanese citizens? And, was it necessary to use the bomb at all? There were reliable reports at the time that the Japanese were near surrender and this was clear to the Pacific command. Many historians have documented the fact that the bombing was done not only against Japan, but as a warning to Russia, to prove we could detonate an A-bomb. This is a very good example of how an exhibit always has a point of view, and that in trying to represent ideas, museums often come into conflict with deeply held American beliefs."<br>
<br>
"I want to ask what's not in D.C. as well," Skenazy says. "There's really been very little done on the Asian American community until recently. And a lot of American Indian history has been consigned to the Natural History Museum, as have African artifacts, which raises a lot of questions right there," Skenazy says. (A new museum, dedicated exclusively to the history of American Indians is being constructed in the city and will open in 2002, but the major display on American Indians in Washington, D.C., has always been housed at the Natural History Museum, which is the home of the nation's collections on prehistoric mammals, dinosaurs, geology, and marine life, among others.)<br>
<br>
Skenazy has tried to create assignments that ask students to think about their own lives in material contexts, putting them in the position of a museum curator. For example, he is asking students to assemble their own collection of objects to represent themselves. "In this way, they have to think about what the objects tell us and how their own stories come out of things and need elaboration for us to understand them. They become mini-curators. We can talk then about what they are revealing, what they are hiding, what other objects they could have included. I'm asking them to think about their lives, but I'm also asking them to reflect on the issues they're dealing with in museum display."<br>
<br>
To add depth to their museum experiences, Skenazy will have students meet with several curators: Tom Crouch, who helped create the original vision of the <i>Enola Gay</i> exhibit; Franklin Odo, who will speak about an exhibit of drawings by Roger Shimamura based his grandmother's diaries from a Japanese American internment camp; and Jennifer Jones, who curated an exhibit of objects from the Vietnam Veterans Memorial.<br>
<br>
Skenazy is coupling museum visits with personal writing and the reading of memoirs. For example, when his students visit the Maryland research facility affiliated with the National Museum of the American Indian, they will read work by N. Scott Momaday. Visits to the "Field to Factory" exhibit at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History (which concerns African American immigration from the South to North from 1915 to 1940) will be complemented by reading the work of Richard Wright. Along with visiting the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, the class will read Art Spiegelman's <i>Maus I</i> and <i>Maus II.</i><br>
<br>
When they view the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, students will read various pieces by visitors to the wall and will also talk about a timely exhibit at the American History Museum, titled "Personal Legacy: Healing of a Nation." Among the items the exhibit includes are letters, beer bottles, teddy bears, childhood blankets, and photographs. "There is a wonderful piece," Skenazy says, "that is a pink triangle, fading into white, with a note underneath saying something to the effect of, 'They honored you for killing men, they scorned you for loving men.' "<br>
<br>
Wanting to explore the connections between institutional memory and personal memory, Skenazy is having his students use their experiences to inspire their own memoir writing. "Most of my writing courses are not intended for writers, per se. I'm interested in getting people who don't think of themselves as writers to get comfortable with putting things on the page," he says.<br>
<br>
There was, Skenazy says, one other inspiration for this course. "I simply wanted to figure out a means for getting the students out exploring the city."

<p>
  For the third time in five years, a graduate of UC Santa Cruz has received a <a href="http://www.pulitzer.org">Pulitzer Prize</a>, journalism's most prestigious honor. Among the winners announced today (Monday, April 10) is Martha Mendoza, who won the prize for investigative journalism as part of an Associated Press team.
</p>In a special report published last year, Mendoza and reporters Sang-Hun Choe and Charles J. Hanley told a chilling story of U.S. soldiers gunning down hundreds of South Korean civilians--many of them women and children--in the early weeks of the Korean War. The killings took place in July 1950 under a railroad bridge near the hamlet No Gun Ri. (View the interactive Associated Press Special Report: <a href="http://wire.ap.org/APpackages/nogunri">Bridge at No Gun Ri.</a>)
<p>
  Based on hundreds of interviews the AP team conducted with South Korean survivors and ex-GIs, the coverage prompted the U.S. military and the South Korean government to agree to review the allegations. The massacre at No Gun Ri has been called one of only two cases of large-scale killing of noncombatants by U.S. ground troops in the 20th century; the other was Vietnam's My Lai in 1968, in which more than 500 Vietnamese were alleged to have been killed.
</p>
<p>
  A Pulitzer Prize carries a cash award of $5,000.

  Besides the Pulitzer Prize, the No Gun Ri story has won numerous awards, including the highly regarded <a href="http://www.liunet.edu/cwis/bklyn/polk/prev99.html">George Polk Award</a> for international reporting. "As we win prizes, it is not something to celebrate," Mendoza said. "We wrote about people dying and I'm trying to really keep that on the forefront. This is about the death of a lot of people."
</p>
<p>
  Mendoza, a 1988 graduate who designed her own major in journalism and education, was affiliated with UCSC's Kresge College. She is a visiting lecturer on campus this quarter, teaching a journalism class through UCSC's Writing Program.
</p>
<p>
  Mendoza is the third UCSC graduate to receive a Pulitzer; Laurie Garrett and Annie Wells received the coveted award in 1996 and 1997, respectively.
</p>
<p>
  Garrett (Merrill College '75), writing as a science and medical reporter for <i>Newsday,</i> received the Pulitzer Prize for explanatory journalism. The award recognized her series of articles about the May 1995 outbreak of the deadly ebola virus in Zaire. Garrett earned a B.A. in biology and spent eight years as a science correspondent at National Public Radio. In February 1996, she received the Alumni Achievement Award from UCSC's Alumni Association in recognition of her career accomplishments.
</p>
<p>
  Wells (College Eight '81), working as a photographer for the <i>Santa Rosa Press Democrat,</i> received a Pulitzer for spot news photography. The award recognized her dramatic photograph, carried in newspapers across the country, of a local firefighter rescuing a teenager from raging floodwaters. Wells's interest in photography began at UCSC in 1979 when she designed her own major of science news writing and photojournalism.

  New findings about the diving strategies of marine mammals by biologists <b>Terrie Williams, Donald Croll, Burney Le Boeuf,</b> and their collaborators at other institutions received widespread news coverage. Williams, who led the study, appeared on national and local TV broadcasts (CNN, the Discovery Channel, ABC's <i>Good Morning America,</i> and KSBW) and on National Public Radio's <i>All Things Considered.</i> The story was covered by major national newspapers, including <i>Newsday,</i> the <i>Washington Post,</i> and the <i>Dallas Morning News,</i> as well as the <i>San Francisco Chronicle, Monterey County Herald,</i> and <i>Santa Cruz County Sentinel.</i> Foreign newspapers around the world also carried the story, including the <i>Times, Daily Telegraph,</i> and <i>Guardian</i> in London.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Jonathan Fox</b>, chair of Latin American and Latino studies, was interviewed by the <i>Miami Herald</i> for a story about changes in Latin American studies programs, which the paper reported are placing a greater emphasis on current events and popular culture. . . . Guatemala's <i>Siglo Veintiuno</i> newspaper noted the publication by Fox's colleague <b>Susanne Jonas</b> of the new book <i>Of Centaurs and Doves: Guatemala's Peace Process.</i><br>
  <br>
  <i>Spirit into Sound,</i> a book coauthored by ethnomusicologist <b>Fredric Lieberman</b> and former Grateful Dead drummer Mickey Hart, continues to get the media's attention. The latest story was a feature in the <i>San Jose Mercury News</i> that appeared in the paper's "Religion & Ethics" section. The book was also praised by <i>San Francisco Examiner</i> jazz critic Phil Elwood, who said it "encourages contemplation; it's good for the soul."<br>
  <br>
  The work of associate professor of mathematics <b>Richard Montgomery</b> was featured on ScienceNOW, a prominent online news site. Montgomery's analysis of the long-standing "three-body problem" showed that the orbits of a trio of stars bound by gravity could trace a figure-eight pattern through space.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Elaine Wheeler</b> of the UC College Prep Initiative was interviewed by a <i>Los Angeles Times</i> reporter for a story about the program that offers online courses to high school students.<br>
  <br>
  Each season UCSC's <b>African American Theater Arts Troupe</b> takes a production on the road. When this season's play, <i>Long Time Since Yesterday,</i> was performed at Merced College, the story was featured in Merced's <i>Sun-Star.</i> Along with profiling the play, the story mentioned that troupe founder and director <b>Don Williams</b> (who is UCSC's theater arts facilities supervisor) has raised more than $30,000 in scholarship funds since establishing the troupe in 1991.<br>
  <br>
  Research conducted by <b>David Fox,</b> a postdoctoral researcher in earth sciences, when he was at the University of Michigan was reported in a <i>New York Times</i> story that also ran in the <i>Santa Cruz County Sentinel.</i> Fox found evidence of past climate changes in the fossil tusks of an ancient relative of elephants that lived between 15 million and 5 million years ago.<br>
  <br>
  Channel 46 covered <b>Life Lab's</b> recent third annual spring conference for educators, which featured Congressman Sam Farr.<br>
  <br>
  News of the new dual admissions collaboration between UCSC and 14 community colleges made KCBS Radio, Bay City News, and KSMS-TV.<br>
  <br>
  Professor emeritus of mathematics <b>Ralph Abraham</b> was a guest on the KUSP Radio program <i>Geek Speak.</i> He discussed a series of classes he is offering to make mathematics more accessible to the general public.<br>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_8726" align="alignright" width="180"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/04/switkes_eugene.00-04-10.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-8726" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/04/switkes_eugene.00-04-10.jpg" alt="Serve's Up: Gene Switkes unleashes a power-packed serve in a tennis game against Dean Fitch.

<p>
  A recent spring day found chemistry professor Gene Switkes on the tennis courts with no hint of the back injury that sidelined him in February. Switkes attributes the speediness of his recovery in part to the use of equipment in UCSC's new Wellness Center.
</p>"People get 'old-age' backs--or middle-aged backs--where they periodically get a twinge," said Switkes. "The center gives you a chance to work it out rather than just sit and wait."
<p>
  After straining his back, Switkes checked in briefly with center director Ryan Andrews and modified his workout routine to emphasize the use of machines that would aid his recuperation. He started out slowly and gradually added weight until he was back in form. "It's a good way to work out a soreness," said Switkes, who focused on stretching and strengthening his back without straining it.
</p>
<p>
  Switkes's commitment to exercise didn't waiver during winter's wet weather. He maintained his regular workout schedule, hitting the Wellness Center two to three times a week and augmenting those sessions with tennis and jogging when the weather cooperated.
</p>
<p>
  Now that he's back on the courts returning serves from regular partner Dean Fitch and others, Switkes has noted improved stamina. "I don't seem to score any more points against Dean, but I'm less tired afterwards," he said.
</p>
<p>
  A fringe benefit of working out in the new Wellness Center is the opportunity it provides to interact informally with chemistry graduate students, many of whom are "finding their way down there," said Switkes. "It's a nice common denominator."
</p>
<p>
  Switkes has become more familiar with the electronic gadgetry on the center's state-of-the-art exercise machines, and he is a regular on the cross-trainer, the stationary bicycle, and the "pecs, legs, and abs" machines. "The abs machines on the first and second floors appear to be the most popular in the whole place," he notes. "I think it's a clear sign of society's vanity." Switkes steers clear of the machines that focus heavily on back muscles, and he prefers to jog outdoors on the track than use the treadmill. After all, he adds with a good-humored nod to vanity, "We've got to work on our tans!"<br>

<p>
  For years scientists have puzzled over the ability of dolphins, seals, and other marine mammals to perform long, deep dives that seem to exceed their aerobic capacities. Now, with the help of sophisticated instruments and video technology, a team of researchers has resolved the paradox and discovered a laid-back diving strategy that appears to be widespread among marine mammals.
</p>The researchers studied Weddell seals hunting beneath the ice in the Antarctic, a northern elephant seal diving in Monterey Bay, a trained bottlenose dolphin diving offshore of San Diego, and a 100-ton blue whale traveling off the coast of northern California. Video cameras mounted on the animals' backs revealed that they all started their dives with a few powerful swimming strokes, then made the rest of the descent mostly in a relaxed glide.<br>
<br>
"Basically, they're turning the motor on and off in the course of the dive, and that enables them to reduce oxygen consumption by 10 to 50 percent compared with what they would need if they swam all the way down," said Terrie Williams, an associate professor of biology at UCSC, who led the research team.<br>
<br>
Williams, working with collaborators from UCSC and several other institutions, found that marine mammals take advantage of a change in buoyancy due to increasing pressure with depth, which enables them to sink effortlessly through the water. The researchers describe their findings in the April 7 issue of the journal <i>Science.</i><br>
<br>
Williams's coauthors include professor emeritus of biology Burney Le Boeuf, research biologist Donald Croll, Randall Davis and Markus Horning of Texas A&M University, Lee Fuiman of the University of Texas at Austin, John Francis of the National Geographic Society, and John Calambokidis of Cascadia Research in Olympia, WA.<br>
<br>
The researchers correlated video images of the diving animals with data from other instruments, including time-depth recorders. With the Weddell seals, the scientists were able to monitor heart rates and measure oxygen consumption during dives. By matching diving behavior with physiological monitoring, Williams was able to calculate the energy savings of prolonged gliding during deep dives.<br>
<br>
"It took some amazing technology and logistics, but the result is a very detailed look at diving behavior and energetics," Williams said. "It really gives you a sense of how finely tuned these animals are to the marine environment, anatomically, physiologically, and behaviorally."<br>
<br>
The range of animals exhibiting the same diving behavior was striking. Cetaceans (whales and dolphins) and pinnipeds (including seals) evolved independently and use quite different mechanisms to propel themselves through the water. The animals studied varied in body size from the 390-pound dolphin to the largest animal on earth, the blue whale, and are found in a wide range of habitats, from Antarctica to the California Coast.<br>
<br>
Despite their diversity, these and other marine mammals share an anatomical feature that makes a gliding descent possible and also protects them from getting the bends, Williams said. Their lungs are designed to collapse progressively with increased hydrostatic pressure at depth so that air is forced out of the alveoli (air sacs) and into the upper part of the respiratory system. As the increasing pressure compresses the animal's body and the air in its respiratory system into a smaller and smaller volume, a marked change in buoyancy occurs.<br>
<br>
"The mass of the animal remains the same while its volume decreases, so it starts to sink," Williams explained.<br>
<br>
In humans and other land animals, air gets trapped in the alveoli as the lungs are compressed, forcing nitrogen into the bloodstream. The result can be nitrogen narcosis, or the bends, a painful and life-threatening syndrome that afflicts divers who return too quickly from deep dives.<br>
<br>
"The progressive collapse of the lungs in marine mammals preadapts them for taking advantage of the buoyancy change," Williams said.<br>
<br>
By resting on the way down, the animals are able to extend their dives. "They're pacing themselves, saving energy and conserving oxygen until they need to expend it for hunting or avoiding predators," Williams said.<br>
<br>
The logistics of these studies were often extremely challenging. The blue whale team, consisting of Francis, Calambokidis, and Croll, had to approach the swimming behemoth in a small boat and attach a camera to its back with a suction cup. The Weddell seal team (Williams, Davis, Fuiman, and Horning) set up camp on the frozen surface of Antarctica's McMurdo Sound and drilled through 15 feet of ice in sub-zero temperatures so they could work with the seals at an isolated breathing hole.<br>
<br>
The research project was funded by the Office of Naval Research, the National Science Foundation, and the National Geographic Society.

        <title>Senate's vote on grades goes to 'mail ballot'</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 10 Apr 2000 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>8723</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  Twenty-seven members of UCSC's <a href="http://senate.ucsc.edu">Academic Senate</a> have requested that a "mail ballot" be issued asking all 588 members to weigh in on the proposal to implement UC's conventional grading system for entering UCSC students in fall 2001. The request for such a ballot, which can be made by as few as 25 members, had been expected in the wake of the senate's 154-77 vote in February to place UCSC's grading policies in line with other UC campuses.
</p>

<p>
  Mary-Beth Harhen, director of the senate office, said her office received the request on March 31. Arguments representing both sides of the issue--and rebuttal arguments--will be part of the ballot that is mailed to senate members. Harhen estimated that the ballots would be distributed by the first week of May; senate members will have approximately two weeks once the ballots are distributed to submit their vote on the matter. The grades resolution will be decided by a simple majority.
</p>

<p>
  Harhen expects the outcome of the vote to be known prior to the next senate meeting, scheduled for May 31. At that meeting, senators are scheduled to discuss the campus's traditional Narrative Evaluation System (NES). George Brown, chair of the senate's Committee on Educational Policy (CEP), has said that his committee would present legislation that would "reform" the NES, not do away with it.<br>
  <br>
  In the grading legislation that is the subject of the mail ballot, students entering in fall 2001 would continue to be able to take courses on a Pass/No Pass (P/NP) basis. But no more than 25 percent of the UCSC course work applied toward graduation credit could be taken on a P/NP basis.
</p>

<p>
  The grading legislation also introduces plus (+) and minus (-) modifiers for grades (A, B, and C only) and would require that a notation of NP be recorded on the student's transcript; the present UCSC policy does not record NP work.
</p>

<p>
  The May 31 meeting, which will take place in Classroom Unit 2, begins at 2 p.m. (one hour earlier than customary).

        <title>UCSC sends out admissions letters to high school seniors</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 10 Apr 2000 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>8722</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  For college-bound high school seniors, spring is dominated by preparation for college life, and one of the biggest decisions for most students is where they will go to school in the fall. UCSC has sent out letters of admission to students across the state and country, and now begins the process of helping students decide if UCSC is the campus for them.
</p>"We received a record number of applications, and our staff worked hard to evaluate them," said J. Michael Thompson, associate vice chancellor for outreach, admissions, and student academic services. "We are very pleased with the academic qualifications and diversity of students to whom we've made admissions offers."<br>
<br>
The campus has planned a series of events to help prospective students learn more about UCSC, including the <a href="http://admissions.ucsc.edu/bssf/">Banana Slug Spring Fair</a>, the campus's annual open house, which will be held this year on Saturday, April 15.<br>
<br>
While applications to UCSC were up 12 percent over last year to a total of 20,260, the campus will only be able to accommodate an entering class of 3,700, said Thompson.
<p>
  The average grade-point average of students who have been admitted to UCSC for the fall quarter is 3.62, and the average SAT score is above 1100, he said. In addition, 135 students are being considered for Regents Scholarships, the most prestigious academic award offered by the UC system to incoming students.

        <title>UC Admits 42,000 students for fall 2000</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 10 Apr 2000 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>8721</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  UC Office of the President Nearly 42,000 California high school students have been admitted as freshmen to the University of California for fall 2000.
</p>Additional students will be admitted as the university offers a place at one of its eight undergraduate campuses to eligible California students not selected by their campus of choice. This next step will allow UC to admit all California students who have met its eligibility requirements.<br>
<br>
UC admitted 7,336 underrepresented minorities (Latino, Chicano, American Indian and African American) for fall 2000, the largest number in four years and the third consecutive annual increase.<br>
<br>
This year's total of underrepresented minority students is also higher than the 7,236 students admitted in 1997, the last year in which the university considered race and gender in its admission process. In 1997, underrepresented minority students made up 19.8 percent of all students who indicated an ethnicity, compared with 19.1 percent for fall 2000.<br>
<br>
"We are pleased to welcome these highly qualified students and, by the time the admissions process is completed in the next few weeks, we expect to meet our longstanding commitment to offer admission to all eligible California high school graduates," said UC President Richard C. Atkinson.<br>
<br>
"I am also pleased to note the increase in the number of underrepresented minority students. The university will continue its efforts to help ensure that more of these students prepare for and enroll at UC."<br>
<br>
During the last three years, UC has been engaged in an aggressive effort to inform students from all backgrounds about eligibility requirements, encourage participation in more rigorous academic courses and help prepare students to take standardized tests.<br>
<br>
Other efforts undertaken by the university, such as partnering with high schools, helping improve teacher quality and increasing access to advanced placement courses, are designed to yield long-term sustainable results for schools looking to prepare more of their students for higher education.<br>
<br>
<b>Gender</b>
<ul>
  <li>For the second consecutive year, female students make up more than 56 percent of all admitted students.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <br>
  <b>Ethnicity</b>
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The number of Chicano students admitted for fall 2000 is 4,373, compared with 4,227 in 1999.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>African-American student admissions went from 1,331 in 1999 to 1,328 for fall 2000. Latino students were unchanged at 1,380.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>White students declined from 19,634 to 18,444, Asian Americans from 14,358 to 14,306 and American Indians from 275 to 255.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>The number of students who declined to state an ethnicity increased from 3,224 to 3,395.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  <br>
  <b>Geography</b>
</p>

<ul>
  <li>As in 1999, two-thirds of students admitted this year reside in Los Angeles and Orange counties and the San Francisco Bay Area.
  </li>

<p>
  Professor of American studies Dana Frank has received the Book of the Year award for 1999 from the International Labor History Association for her book, <i>Buy American: The Untold Story of Economic Nationalism</i> (Beacon Press, 1999).

<p>
  Several UCSC affiliates made the annual meeting of the <a href="http://www.library.arizona.edu/aladn">Academic Library Advancement and Development Network</a> (ALADN) a success. ALADN is the major organization of academic library development officers. This year's meeting, which took place in early April at Asilomar, was titled "Library Fundraising in the New Century." The event featured a guest panel that addressed the topic of "Listening to our major donors: Why do they give?" The panel, organized by librarian Margaret Gordon, featured UCSC Foundation board members Anne Levin and Lynn Stegner, and was moderated by university librarian Alan Dyson. Stegner discussed the enduring value of books and why people would want to give to preserve them. Levin, who in 1995 established the Neufeld-Levin Chair in Holocaust Studies at UCSC as well as the Neufeld Family Archive at the library, discussed how important it is for the donors of major endowments to couple that gift with one to the library so that there is a strong collection to support the activities generated by the gift. Levin also spoke compellingly later on during a roundtable discussion on major donors.

<p>
  The reach and impact of faculty in international economics continues to impress. Most recently, economics professor Ken Kletzer presented a paper, titled "Will Self-Protection Policies Safeguard Emerging Markets from Crises?," at the annual Financial Markets and Development Conference hosted by the World Bank, the Brookings Institution, and the International Monetary Fund in New York March 30-31. The paper will be published in a forthcoming Brookings volume.
</p>

<p>
  Associate Professor Yin-Wong Cheung just left for a monthlong stay at the Center for Economic Studies in Munich. The center's program for visiting economists is the most extensive and prestigious in Europe. Cheung will be delivering several lectures on empirical studies of real exchange-rate dynamics.
</p>

<p>
  Department chair Dan Friedman just returned from Japan, where he delivered the plenary talk, "The Viability of Vengeance," to the third annual Association of Evolutionary Economists in Tokyo on March 25. His talk drew more than 100 Japanese economists, as well as about a dozen from other countries. Friedman also gave talks to smaller gatherings of experimental economists in Tokyo and Osaka.
</p>

<p>
  Associate Professor Menzie Chinn has been on the lecture circuit, delivering talks at the Swiss National Bank, the Bank for International Settlements, the Swedish Royal Bank, the Tinbergen Institute in Rotterdam, the Center for European Integration at Bonn University, and Hamburg University, among other places. He also presented a paper, titled "Empirical Determinants of the Euro: Short and Long-Run Perspectives," at the Deutsche Bundesbank's Conference on Equilibrium Values of the Euro in Frankfurt.<br>

  <b>The following statement was released today (Friday, April 7) by V. Wayne Kennedy, UC senior vice president--business and finance:</b><br>
  <br>
  After careful consideration and consultation with numerous members of the university's faculty, staff, students, and student organizations, the University of California has decided to become a member of the Worker Rights Consortium on a year-long trial basis, effective immediately. The decision affects all 10 UC campuses.<br>
  <br>
  The Worker Rights Consortium is an organization devoted to monitoring worker conditions in factories around the world that manufacture products intended for university licensure, such as apparel. The university is joining the consortium on a trial basis to further evaluate the organization's progress toward effective monitoring of factory conditions.
</p>

<p>
  The work of the UC Advisory Group on Monitoring and Enforcement Issues will continue its work under UC Berkeley Vice Chancellor Horace Mitchell.<br>
  <br>
  The university has taken this step in order to make clear its commitment to ensuring that the workers who produce the goods sold with University of California identification are treated fairly and humanely and work under safe and decent working conditions.<br>
  <br>
  Along with Harvard University, the University of Notre Dame, the University of Michigan, and Ohio State University, the University of California will continue to participate in the Independent University Initiative. This Harvard-initiated study brings together a diverse group of experts to visit factories in seven countries to gather accurate, firsthand information on working conditions. Results of the Independent University Initiative study are expected this summer.<br>

        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  Three Ph.D. offerings at UC Santa Cruz are among the best in the country, according to the 2001 edition of <i>U.S. News & World Report's</i> popular guide helping students select graduate schools. The rankings appear in the magazine's "Best Graduate Schools" guide, released March 31.
</p>

<p>
  Specifically, UCSC was highly ranked nationally in the following Ph.D. program areas:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Geology</b>. In the overall rankings in this field, UCSC made the top-25, finishing in a tie for 23rd. The campus's Earth Sciences Department, which offers bachelor's and master's degrees in addition to a Ph.D., has been highly ranked in other national assessments. A National Research Council survey in 1995 ranked earth sciences in the top quartile of all doctoral programs in that field; the assessment takes place every ten years.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Third World Literature</b>. UCSC made the top-10 ranking, finishing fourth, in the Third World Literature "specialty" in the field of English. The campus's Literature Department offers bachelor's and master's degrees in addition to a Ph.D. The doctorate offers concentrations in American, British, and other English literatures; French literature; modern literary studies; pre- and early modern studies; Spanish, Latin American, and Latino literatures; and world literature and cultural studies.
  </li>
  <li>
    <b>Astrophysics/Space</b>. UCSC made the top-10 ranking, finishing tenth, in the Astrophysics/Space "specialty" in the field of physics. The campus's Astronomy and Astrophysics Department, which offers a doctorate and an undergraduate minor, has also been highly ranked in other national assessments. UCSC astrophysicists, for example, were recently ranked first in a survey measuring the impact of research on the field. The survey, evaluating the top 100 federally funded U.S. universities, was completed by the Institute for Scientific Information and ranked universities whose research papers attracted the most attention from other scholars in each of 24 fields between 1994 and 1998.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  <i>U.S. News</i> first ranked graduate schools in 1987 and has done so annually since 1990. The survey's rankings of master's and doctoral programs in the arts, sciences, social sciences, and humanities are based on the results of surveys sent to faculty leaders in each discipline around the country.

  By Don Savage, NASA
</p>
<p>
  Planet-hunting astronomers announced last week that they have crossed an important threshold in planet detection with the discovery of two planets that may be smaller in mass than Saturn.<br>
  <br>
</p>Of the 30 extrasolar planets around sun-like stars detected previously, all have been the size of Jupiter or larger. The existence of these Saturn-sized planets suggests that many stars may harbor smaller planets in addition to the Jupiter-sized ones.<br>
<br>
"It's a harbinger of things to come because it shows that as we continue to push this technique we're able to see smaller planets, so it's very exciting," said Steven Vogt, UCSC professor of astronomy and astrophysics.<br>
<br>
The discovery was made by planet-sleuths Geoffrey Marcy of UC Berkeley, Paul Butler of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, and Vogt, using the Keck I telescope in Mauna Kea, Hawaii.<br>
<br>
Finding Saturn-sized planets reinforces the theory that planets form by a snowball effect of growth from small ones to large, in a star-encircling dust disk. The 20-year-old theory predicts there should be more smaller planets than large planets, and this is a trend the researchers are beginning to see in their data.<br>
<br>
"It's like looking at a beach from a distance," explained Marcy. "Previously we only saw the large boulders, which were Jupiter-sized planets or larger. Now we are seeing the 'rocks,' Saturn-sized planets or smaller. We still don't have the capability of detecting Earth-like planets, which would be equivalent to seeing pebbles on the beach."<br>
<br>
Jupiter alone is three times the mass of Saturn. This has left open the nagging possibility that some of the extrasolar planets might really be stillborn stars, called brown dwarfs, which would form like stars through the collapse of a gas cloud. But now researchers are better assured that these "Jupiters" are only the tip of the iceberg, and that there are many more planets to be found that have the mass of Saturn or smaller.<br>
<br>
"Now we are confident we are seeing a distinctly different population of bodies that formed out of dust disks like the disks Hubble Space Telescope has imaged around stars," Marcy said.<br>
<br>
The researchers discovered a planet at least 80 percent the mass of Saturn orbiting the star HD46375, 109 light-years away in the constellation Monoceros, and a planet 70 percent the mass of Saturn orbiting around the star 79 Ceti (also known as HD16141) located 117 light-years away in the constellation Cetus.<br>
<br>
These planets are very close to their stars and so have short orbits. They whirl around their parent stars with periods of 3.02 days and 75 days respectively. This allowed for their discovery in a relatively short order.<br>
<br>
The astronomers detected the small wobble of a star caused by the gravitational tug of the unseen planets. For the past five years Marcy and Butler have used this technique successfully to catalog 21 extrasolar planets. Boosted by the light-gathering power of the Keck telescope and the "HIRES" spectrograph designed by Vogt, they have steadily increased the precision of their measurements so they can look for the gravitational effects of ever smaller bodies. In this latest detection, the change in a star's velocity as it moves rhythmically toward and then away from Earth is only 11 meters per second, a little faster than human sprinting speed.<br>
<br>
The Saturn-mass planets are presumably gas giants, made mostly of primordial hydrogen and helium, rather than the rocky material Earth is made of. They are so close to their parent stars they are extremely hot, and are not abodes for life as we know it.<br>
<br>
They probably formed at a farther distance from the star, where they could accumulate cool gas, and then migrated into their present orbits. Along the way they would have disrupted the orbits of any smaller terrestrial planets like Earth. These "marauding" gas giants seem more the rule than the exception among the planets surveyed so far. That's because Marcy and Butler's detection technique favors finding massive planets in short-period orbits. And that seems to be the case for approximately six percent of the stars surveyed so far.<br>
<br>
Their research is part of a multi-year project to look for wobbles among 1,100 stars within 300 light-years of Earth. The project is supported by NASA and the National Science Foundation.

  Psychology's emeriti have been out in force lately. <b>Elliot Aronson</b> penned an op-ed on school violence for the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> following the Michigan tragedy. And his colleague <b>Tom Pettigrew</b> was tapped by the <i>Times,</i> as well as the <i>San Francisco Examiner,</i> for comment on John McCain's use of a derogatory term to refer to his captors in Vietnam.
</p>

<p>
  Continuing their quest for planets outside the solar system, professor of astronomy and astrophysics <b>Steven Vogt</b> and his colleagues recently discovered the smallest extrasolar planets yet detected, although these Saturn-size planets are still much larger than Earth. Vogt was interviewed by local TV stations KION-Channel 46 and KSBW-Channel 35 and was quoted in the <i>Santa Cruz County Sentinel.</i> His role in the findings was also mentioned in articles in the <i>New York Times, San Francisco Chronicle, San Jose Mercury News,</i> and in an Associated Press wire story.
</p>

<p>
  The <i>San Jose Mercury News</i> sought the expertise of <b>Manuel Pastor</b> for a story on changes among the Latino electorate. <b>Pastor</b> also coauthored a commentary for the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> about pollution risks faced by minorities in southern California.
</p>

<p>
  <b>The Farm</b> was a lovely backdrop for a recent CNN story about Aptos organic foods maven Nell Newman.

<p>
  History professor Bruce Levine will present a talk titled "An Emancipation Proclamation for the Confederacy" on Thursday, April 13, from 7 to 8 p.m. at the Museum of Art and History at the McPherson Center, 705 Front St., Santa Cruz. The talk is a part of the Humanities Lecture Series, sponsored jointly by the Humanities Division and the Museum of Art and History. The talk is free and open to the public. A reception follows.
</p>Levine has written and taught on a wide range of historical subjects, but his main interests are the U.S.'s Civil War era and the trans-Atlantic "age of revolutions." He is the author of four books: <i>Half Slave and Half Free: The Roots of the Civil War</i> (1992); <i>The Spirit of 1848: German Immigrants, Labor Conflict, and the Coming of the Civil War</i> (1992); <i>Who Built America, Volume One</i> (1989) (principal author); and <i>Who Built America, Volume Two</i> (1992) (contributing author).
<p>
  Previous to coming to UCSC in 1997, Levine was a professor of history at the University of Cincinnati for 11 years and, before that, worked as director of research and writing for the American Social History Project at the City University of New York's Graduate Center.<br>
  <br>

        <title>Mr. Glass Goes to Santa Cruz: A Q&A with the evocative, invisible Ira Glass</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 03 Apr 2000 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>

<p>
  We've all seen them. People alone in their cars--otherwise sane-seeming men and women--guffawing without inhibition or clutching the steering wheel and weeping uncontrollably. It's possible those people are simply living out their solitary dramas, but it's just as likely that they are listening to <i>This American Life</i>--the public radio show produced and hosted by Ira Glass.<br>
  <br>
</p>Glass will be in town for a talk, titled "Lies, Sissies, and Fiascoes: Notes on Making a New Kind of Radio," on April 28. The talk, which he will present at 7 and 9 p.m., in the Media Theater, is a one-time presentation, taking place exclusively at UCSC. For tickets, call (831) 459-2159.<br>
<br>
Glass's award-winning show centers on a different theme each week and delivers four to five segments on that theme. The segments can be monologues, interviews, dramatic readings, pretty much anything as long as, as Glass says, they have a "heart-gripping, memorable quality." That quality is the show's trademark--the thing that, even if it hasn't made longtime fans sob openly at the wheel, has caused them to be late for appointments because they simply couldn't switch off the show when they arrived at their destination.<br>
<br>
<i>This American Life</i> premiered in Chicago in late 1995, won a Peabody Award right off the bat, and went national the following spring. It now airs on more than 300 public radio stations (locally on KUSP 88.9 FM at 4 p.m. Friday and 7 p.m. Sunday).<br>
<br>
Glass, 40, began his career in radio in 1978 as an intern at National Public Radio (NPR), working for <i>All Things Considered</i> and <i>Morning Edition.</i> In his 20 years in radio he has done everything except build them--working as a tape cutter, newscast writer, desk assistant, editor, producer, reporter, and substitute host. In NPR's Chicago Bureau, he created several award-winning documentaries on public schools and race relations. In May of 1999, Rhino Records released the two-CD set <i>Lies, Sissies & Fiascoes: The Best of This American Life.</i><br>

<h2>
  Q&A
</h2>
<p>
  <b>Q:</b> You use music in a way that makes it almost a second voice in the story--at times it interjects a statement into the monologue that can convey irony, poignancy, significance. How did you develop such exquisite timing and such a keen ear for the right piece of music?<br>
  <br>
  <b>A:</b> Well, I don't think of it as a second voice, but we think of it as a really integral part of the show and the effect of the show. I've been reading the Harry Potter books and there's an utterly gratuitous but wonderful moment --there are a lot of those in the book, these throw-away gratuitous moments that are just wonderful. And, anyway, in this one, Harry has just arrived at the school and is sitting in a ceremony with his soon-to-be-friends. At the end of the ceremony they sing the school song and the headmaster says to himself "Ah, music. A far greater magic than anything we do here." And that's just it. Music is powerful. It makes every thing better and creates a mood and makes it feel like things are moving forward.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Q:</b> One of the pieces that I think works so well on your CD is "Peter Pan," in which a guy tells the story of a director with grand ambitions. He talks about the opening performance and the series of disasters that occur. And in the background, Ravel's <i>Bolero</i> is carrying the story right along in the most beautiful way.<br>
  <br>
  <b>A:</b> <i>Bolero</i> is so fantastically corny a choice of music, we almost didn't use it. But the producer who mixed that piece was Nancy Updike, and she's fantastic. She felt it fit the pacing of the show so well, where the disasters get bigger and bigger as it progresses, so we went with it.<br>
  <br>
  At one point I gave a copy of the CD to Philip Glass, who is my cousin whom I had never met. And so I gave him our CD and I said, "If you're going to listen to one show on here, listen to this one." I thought of that because, basically, he's in the business of theatrical production and this is a show of theatrical production where everything goes wrong. But a day later it occurred to me what I had steered him to. And I thought, "Oh my god, he's going to hear that and it's the corniest piece of music in the world."<br>
  <br>
  But, you know, someone once said, "Never underestimate the power of cheap music." And it's true. You can go for the cheesiest effect and it works.<br>
  <br>
  When I'm putting the music in the new stuff it always reminds me of this thing I learned as a teenager. I learned to do magic tricks with sleight-of-hand and, when it works, you can even do it on yourself. You can stand in front of a mirror and make the coin disappear and it works on you. Obviously you know where it went and what you did, but you watch yourself doing it and part of you is convinced by what you see in the mirror. And there are a lot of times when I have that feeling about the show. You pull a piece together and while you're in the process it doesn't sound that remarkable, but when it's in final form, you know, like the coin in the hand, you can fool yourself. It can appear remarkable.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Q:</b> How many people put the show together?<br>
  <br>
  <b>A:</b> Me and, now, four producers. For any given show one of the four will coproduce with me and that person and I decide on all the stories and the angles.<br>
  <br>
  We tend to chat about it a lot. More work goes into conceiving the show than producing it. Once we have the stories nailed down we turn them around very fast--a day or two. But figuring out what the story is and what you're going to go for, that takes time.<br>
  <br>
  And once a story is taped we may not use it. Often we'll go through 15 or 20 ideas and pay somebody to write and gather tape and, when we're finished, several of them may not make the cut. Some things you've just got to try to see if there's a story there.<br>
  <br>
  The very best stuff comes from chance and luck and so we try and create a context where chance and luck can strike every week. You'll hit gold more often if you simply try out a lot of things. Very few organizations work that way. Maybe the <i>New York Times</i> or the <i>New Yorker,</i> they're among the few that commission a lot more work than you ultimately see in the magazine.<br>
  <br>
  When I worked at <i>All Things Considered</i> if I was assigned a story and I was told that story would be on tonight and be four-and-a-half minutes long, then it would be on that night and it would be four-and-a-half minutes long. Having the luxury to think things through with people is idyllic--it's what every person on a daily show dreams of.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Q:</b> Even with a week to produce each show, your job is not exactly low-key. How do you live with the intensity of this job? Can you live a normal life?<br>
  <br>
  <b>A:</b> Oh yes. But it still feels new to me and I still feel like I haven't quite mastered it. Every week is just as frightening as the week before. Sometimes it takes me a full day to achieve a normal level of tension. You know what I mean?<br>
  <br>
  We send the show out on satellite on Friday and usually Saturday is completely shot for me. I didn't even realize this until recently because I've been seeing someone and it's become an issue. It's like I'm still coming down off drugs on Saturday. This happens to a lot of people in broadcasting.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Q:</b> It's an intense process, producing the show, isn't it? But you always sound so relaxed and engaged when you're on the air. How do you manage that?<br>
  <br>
  <b>A:</b> One of the things that's peculiar about radio is the public performance aspect of it. You have to seem really relaxed or it doesn't work right. Right before the show, what we're doing is scrambling around and changing little things: rewriting introductions and retiming the show from that point, and it's really frantic. And the second the mike goes on, I have to be like, okay, we're just chatting. So, what I do is pretend I'm talking to exactly one person.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Q:</b> What makes a segment work for you. What's the difference between the one that airs and the one that hits the cutting-room floor?<br>
  <br>
  <b>A:</b> There's a lot of really competent material that we generate on the show that would be okay but it doesn't have the heart-gripping memorable quality that makes you stop and makes you remember later and surprises you.<br>
  <br>
  Stories that we are looking for are ones we feel thrilled about putting on the radio. The structure is to have these be surprising stories with surprising voices. You know, I mean, mediocrity is a powerful force. The entire machine of the show, the production, is designed about making luck happen. When it works, you know it, because it's really different. You say, "I've never heard that before and I'm so glad to hear it." That's what we're aiming for.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Q:</b> You have an amazing talent for interviewing. People open up and reveal themselves and express profound ideas in a really astonishing way in your interviews. What is the most important skill you have as an interviewer?<br>
  <br>
  <b>A:</b> I get asked a lot what's the greatest secret to interviewing and the big secret is to be actually curious. I think when somebody is talking about the thing that means most to them in the world or a question that's unresolved in their head they are articulate. Americans, as a people, are stunningly open. It's not like traveling in France or Germany. People here will actually tell you what they think and they won't hold back. They're funny and smart and articulate in every walk of life. I'm never surprised about that.<br>
  <br>
  For me, it isn't the question of, can this person step up to the plate, but, what do they care about that I can ask something about. If I can find the thing they care about or that is unresolved in their head, then they'll have something to say.<br>
  <br>
  Terry Gross [producer of NPR's <i>Fresh Air</i>] said the thing about being an interviewer that's odd is you have to simultaneously be the person's therapist and friend, encouraging them to open up and share, and still be a ruthless editor, thinking, "This isn't working, where can I take it now."<br>
  <br>
  <b>Q:</b> Many of the stories on <i>This American Life</i> have stayed with me, have even haunted me. Are there any that have done that to you over the years?<br>
  <br>
  <b>A:</b> The one that haunted me the most is the story about this woman named Dorothy Gaines who was thrown into prison for 19 years. We came across her story while working on a show about changes in U.S. sentencing laws. That sounds like it would be an unbelievably dull issue, but we try not to be knee-jerk about these problems and be precise and still tell the thing through novelistic stories.<br>
  <br>
  So, we told the story of this woman who got 19 years. She was thrown in prison based on the testimony of people who admitted to being a part of a drug ring and could get their time reduced by naming other people. She was a working nurse with two kids. The police searched her house and found no evidence of drugs. In court everyone else copped a plea and got a year. She didn't cop a plea. She and her public defender said she's innocent, there is no evidence of guilt, so why cop a plea? She was found guilty and sentenced to 19 years. That's the same amount of time she would have gotten if she had hijacked a plane. It's more than she would have gotten for second-degree murder or rape. And so she's doing this time and really her only chance is that she would get a presidential pardon.<br>
  <br>
  I really feel like we didn't do enough for her. I feel like I should be devoting more time to her. Doing something. I wish I could say that that happens more often, that we can do something. But the fact is, I'm in the situation where every week I'm so busy and scared that I'm going to put together a nice show that there's not even time to feel wistful about the show or the story from the week before.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Q:</b> Who would you like to have interview you?<br>
  <br>
  <b>A:</b> Terry Gross. I actually was interviewed by Terry Gross once, more than a year ago, and it was utterly distracting. You know, because I know Terry and we've met and we'll talk every now and then. The public radio world is pretty small. And then she's interviewing me and, how to say this, I felt really self-conscious to be talking about myself and I wanted to be a good interviewee and give to her what I ask other people to give to me. So I tried to be honest. And right in the middle of a lot of my answers, I would begin to think, "Why am I here talking about this?" That was the main thing that was odd. I don't exactly see why someone would be interested in me. From an analytical point of view, I understand that I do a radio show and I am a public figure so people might have a mild curiosity about why I do the show and who I am. So, from a personal point of view, that was the most uncomfortable thing.<br>
  <br>
  She is an exceptional interviewer. She is the queen. There were certain things that people asked me about in every other interview I'd had recently that she came about in the slyest damn way. And it would take me a moment to answer because I was struck by the skillfulness of the way she was approaching the subject--the sheer craft of it was so beautiful. I don't know, it was like watching Michael Jordan.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Q:</b> Can you think of a specific example?<br>
  <br>
  <b>A:</b> One of the questions that came up a lot, that had been written about the show, was how many hours I work on it, and the fact that I work on it all the time. To me it's not remarkable, it's like anybody starting a new business, I don't view that as strange. But in every article for a while that would be a big big part of the story. She brought up the subject by saying something like, "A lot has been written about how many hours you put in working on your job. What's the thing you miss most from regular life?" Which is such a graceful way of documenting who this person is and capturing what their life is like for the audience without having me repeat everything that's already been written, because that's not moving the story forward.<br>
  <br>
  I have to say, when she asked it, it took me a moment to even think of my answer because I was so struck with the question. I was realizing, she wants to document that part of my life but doesn't want to talk about it because it's stupid. So here's what she asks instead, which gets me reflecting on this experience and, in a certain way, more wistfully, gets me reflecting with emotion. For me, someone who does three or four interviews a week, I don't think I step up to that standard.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Q:</b> You met with executives from several major networks last summer to discuss taking this show to a TV format. What's the status of that project?<br>
  <br>
  <b>A:</b> We got very very generous and appropriate offers from two television networks and my staff and I met and decided we didn't want to commit ourselves to doing a series because we didn't want to stop doing radio. But we might do a special. We'll return to that idea at some point.<br>
  <br>
  It amuses me, the idea of doing a TV show. It would be interesting to see how it would work out. But I feel nothing lacking from radio. Its true power is so rarely used that simply by trying to tell the stories we tell in the novelistic way that we do seems really unusual. Because we simply try to harness the power of radio, I feel like our show really stands out.

        <title>Dual admissions program launched by UCSC and 14 community colleges</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 03 Apr 2000 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  UCSC is teaming up with 14 regional community colleges to increase the number of students transferring from community colleges to the University of California. UCSC Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood is collaborating with the presidents of community colleges in Silicon Valley and the Monterey Bay Area to make it easier for students to transfer to UC campuses. As a result of the first meeting of the newly formed Regional Council, made up of Greenwood and her counterparts at each of the schools, participants have launched a dual admissions program that guarantees community college students a spot at UCSC after successful completion of their first two years of course work. "By offering a clear pathway to the university, dual admissions takes the uncertainty out of the transfer process," said Foothill College President Bernadine Chuck Fong. "Students know that once they have met the basic requirements, there will already be a spot at UCSC waiting for them. This program allows us to communicate our message of encouraging transfer much earlier, and it keeps the student's long-term educational goals at the forefront." Dual admissions is the first initiative of the Regional Council, which has the overarching goal of supporting transfer-related activities, such as advising, campus visits, and staff assistance. "We know that many of our students aspire to transfer to the University of California, and the Regional Council's goal is to make that vision a reality for more students," said President Chui L. Tsang of San Jose City College. "Pooling our resources will allow us to do more for greater numbers of students." In addition to UCSC, participating colleges are:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cabrillo College, Aptos
  </li>
  <li>Canada College, Redwood City
  </li>
  <li>College of San Mateo, San Mateo
  </li>
  <li>De Anza College, Cupertino
  </li>
  <li>Evergreen Valley College, San Jose
  </li>
  <li>Foothill College, Los Altos Hills
  </li>
  <li>Gavilan College, Gilroy
  </li>
  <li>Hartnell College, Salinas
  </li>
  <li>Merced College, Merced
  </li>
  <li>Mission College, Santa Clara
  </li>
  <li>Monterey Peninsula College, Monterey
  </li>
  <li>San Jose City College, San Jose
  </li>
  <li>Skyline College, San Bruno
  </li>
  <li>West Valley College, Saratoga
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  To increase the university's visibility on community college campuses, UCSC is hiring additional outreach counselors and advisers to work at the 14 colleges that make up the Regional Council. The outreach counselors will visit the schools and collaborate with college staff on facilitating the transfer process. Unlike existing outreach activities funded by the UCSC Admissions Office, which encourage students to attend UCSC, this new funding supports transfers to any UC campus.<br>
  <br>
  "Of course, we will be thrilled if they choose UC Santa Cruz, but that's our secondary concern," said Greenwood. "Our first priority is to help students prepare to attend any UC campus."<br>
  <br>
  Increasing the number of students who transfer from a community college to the university is a goal shared by both institutions. A memorandum of understanding designed to encourage such transfers was signed in 1997 by Chancellor Thomas Nussbaum of the California Community Colleges and UC President Richard Atkinson.<br>
  <br>
  The dual admissions program builds on the success of a similar effort begun last year at Cabrillo College in Aptos. The Student Transfer Education Pathway, or STEP program, was designed to support the transfer of Cabrillo students to UCSC by offering them special services.<br>
  <br>
  "As a group, community colleges share many of the same goals, and we're pleased that our STEP program paved the way for a broader dual admissions initiative," said Cabrillo College President John Hurd, who endorsed the Regional Council's efforts. "The Regional Council provides a needed forum for the discussion of new ideas, and it allows us to work collectively in partnership with the university."<br>
  <br>
  Other initiatives under consideration include improved articulation services, faculty-to-faculty professional development opportunities, and earlier identification of students who are considering transferring. UCSC has agreed to provide full articulation services at each Regional Council campus annually, which means that each community college course will be evaluated to see if students can count the course as a prerequisite for a UC major and if it fullfills a UCSC general education requirement.<br>
  <br>
  Members of the Regional Council will meet two or three times a year, and a working group is meeting on an ongoing basis.

  <br>
  Alumni wistful to revisit their alma mater; current and prospective students and their families wanting to get an up-close look at the university; and friends of the campus curious about UCSC's current programs will want to mark Saturday, April 15 on their calendar. That's the date for UCSC's Banana Slug Spring Fair campus open house, featuring information fairs, workshops and presentations, events and receptions, artistic performances, facility tours, and alumni reunions.<br>
  <br>
</p>The campus open house begins at 9 a.m. and lasts until 4 p.m., with some activities lasting into the evening. Last year's Banana Slug Spring Fair drew over 6,000 people to the campus, and that number is expected to grow this year.<br>
<br>
Three major fairs will take place: the Student Support Fair, with information about Housing Services, Financial Aid, Educational Opportunity Programs, and the Disability Resource Center; the Academic Advising Fair, featuring faculty and students advising about academic requirements and programs; and the Student Center Block Party, which will highlight student government, media, resource centers, organizations, and clubs contributing to student life at UCSC.<br>
<br>
Tours will take place at the arts facilities, UCSC's eight individual colleges, the new Seymour Marine Discovery Center at Long Marine Laboratory, the Alan Chadwick Garden, and the East Field House and new Wellness Center. Visitors may also purchase a barbecue lunch at several sites on campus.<br>
<br>
Faculty and staff will provide in-depth workshops on academic programs, financial aid, Educational Opportunity Programs, how to choose a college, transferring to UCSC, and life outside the classroom.<br>
<br>
Other events include a library open house, music ensembles, the Gay, Lesbian, Bi, Transgender Resource Center Open House, art gallery exhibits, the African American Student Life and Resource Center Homecoming 2000 reception, and the Chicano/Latino reception and cultural performance featuring the traditional dance group Grupo Folklorico Los Mejicas.<br>
<br>
An outdoor afternoon performance of <i>Love's Labours Lost</i> by Shakespeare To Go begins at 1:30 p.m. at the Music Center courtyard, and tickets are available for the evening performance of the Lula Washington Dance Company's <i>Rites 2000</i> at the Theater Arts Mainstage at 8 p.m.<br>
<br>
There are many alumni events planned for this year. Some of them require an advance RSVP and fee; contact the Alumni Association at (800) 933-SLUG.<br>
<br>
The All Alumni Reunion Luncheon seats alumni guests by graduation year so alumni can find their old friends. UCSC Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood gives special recognition to the classes of '95, '90, '85, '80, '75, and '70.<br>
<br>
Encuentro 2000 will bring together Latino and Chicano alumni from 1965 through the present for the first time. The full weekend of events will include a reception with Latino and Chicano faculty and staff, an alumni panel discussion, performances by UCSC's folkloric dance troupe Los Mejicas, opportunities for dialogue with current and prospective students, and a Saturday night dinner, program, and dance.<br>
<br>
African American Alumni Reunion 2000 will bring together UCSC's African American graduates from all eras, their families and friends, for the first time. Three days of events will include a reception with African American faculty and staff, a Mentors' Circle with current students, a Saturday night dinner, program and dance featuring Oakes founding provost J. Herman Blake, and more.<br>
<br>
The Oakes College Twenty-Fifth Anniversary Celebration will offer Oakes alumni, current students, staff, and faculty an opportunity for lively discussion of the Oakes legacy. Oakes founding provost J. Herman Blake will attend.<br>
<br>
Founding faculty member John Dizikes, professor of American studies and former Cowell Provost, will be honored for his 35 years of teaching at a Cowell reception. Dizikes is retiring in June.<br>
<br>
The Women's Studies Founders' Luncheon on Sunday, April 16, will honor that department's founding faculty and students. Special guests include Professor Bettina Aptheker and Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood.<br>
<br>
A public lecture, "Making Light Work of Biology: Using Lasers to Understand Biomolecules," will be given by David Kliger, professor of chemistry and biochemistry and dean of the Division of Natural Sciences. Kliger is a pioneer in the use of extremely fast laser pulses to study how molecules interact with light, and he now heads one of the top laboratories in the world in this field.<br>
<br>
Every college will offer daytime tours and a late-afternoon reception, generally at the provost's home. At Porter, taiko drummers will provide afternoon entertainment. At Merrill College, guests can enjoy watching students in their annual rite of painting the moat, or can make a souvenir T-shirt.<br>
<br>

<p>
  Not long ago, the idea of women's studies was little understood or regarded. But then came the Women's Liberation Movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s and, along with it, a whole new perspective on the importance of the role of women in history, literature, science, and myriad other fields.
</p>One of the country's most highly regarded and long-standing women's studies programs turns 25 this year. The program, located at the University of California, Santa Cruz, began with a single class in 1971. The following year some 700 students petitioned the administration to establish a full-fledged program and, in the spring of 1975, the first degrees in women's studies were conferred. At that time, UCSC was one of the few schools in the country to offer a major in the subject.<br>
<br>
Since it was established, UCSC's Women's Studies Department has gained international distinction as the home of some of the country's most outstanding scholars in the field--women whose work has revolutionized many areas of academia.<br>
<br>
To celebrate its anniversary, the department is hosting a luncheon on April 16 and a residency program in May (for details, see below).<br>
<br>
A trademark of UCSC's program is an emphasis on academic excellence in partnership with social activism. According to UCSC Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood, "Women's studies at UCSC has shown itself to be a world-class model for an academic discipline--deepening our body of knowledge and, at the same time, making the world a better place to live."<br>
<br>
Many of the department's graduates have gone on to establish important community organizations, including the Santa Cruz Women's Health Center and Defensa de Mujeres in Watsonville.<br>
<br>
A number of UCSC faculty and alumni are behind landmark gender-related work that has literally altered the scope of a number of academic disciplines, including anthropology, the arts, education, history, health, industry, law, literature, linguistics, sociology, and, perhaps most surprisingly, science.<br>
<br>
"Women's studies challenged the idea of science as an objective field," says Bettina Aptheker, a professor of women's studies who came to UCSC in 1979. "It has shown that human beings project their own framework onto their research. As a result, we've come to realize that science is not nearly as objective as was once believed."<br>
<br>
For example, Aptheker says, theories in the fields of physical and cultural anthropology have changed substantially in the last 25 years. Aptheker cites the work of Adrienne Zihlman, a UCSC professor of anthropology, as having altered the way we understand the development of our species.<br>
<br>
"Traditional assumptions about early humans put forth the idea that hunting was the primary way in which people not only acquired food but also served as the engine by which humans developed and learned such skills as foresight and language. The advent of feminist scholarship challenged those notions with very solid physical evidence, which indicated that 95 percent of the food those people ate was gathered, not hunted, and that the gathering was done by women. It has also been demonstrated that the primary way in which language developed was between the mother and the child."<br>
<br>
Donna Haraway, a UCSC professor of history of consciousness and women's studies, is considered one of the country's leading scholars in the study of the history of science. Her landmark book <i>Primate Visions: Gender, Race, and Nature in the World of Modern Science</i> (Routledge, 1989) transformed the way we look at the field of primatology. She demonstrated that male scholars had projected ideas about men and masculinity into their research on primates, leading to a number of questionable conclusions. One example was the belief that baboons were the primate most closely related to humans, an assumption made based on the dominance of the males and their superior size. Today it is generally believed that chimpanzees are more comparable to humans, based, in part, on the relatively similar sizes between genders and their humanlike use of tools.<br>
<br>
Aptheker also notes that the field of history has been considerably altered because of women's studies. "Look at the textbooks in the 1960s: In the major texts that were used, there is a clear and complete absence of women and people of color," she says. "We used to be taught primarily diplomatic history--the history of wars and revolutions--which is very male-centered. But a subfield of history, called social history, has demonstrated that women and people of color have been crucial in every historical period and made major contributions."<br>
<br>
An example of a male-centered perspective on history is the characterization of the Renaissance era, says Aptheker. "The early Renaissance was hailed as a period of great enlightenment. But this was also a time of witch hunts and the continued persecutions of women, so from a women-centered perspective this was a time of great repression and loss of rights."<br>

<p>
  <b>Celebrate Women's Studies 25th Anniversary</b>
</p>
<p>
  On April 16 a luncheon will be held to celebrate the 25th anniversary of women's studies. The luncheon, which coincides with UCSC's Banana Slug Spring Fair reunion weekend, is open to the public. It takes place from 11 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. at the Arboretum and costs $15 per person or $25 for two people. Advance reservations are necessary and can be made by calling (831) 459-4324.<br>
  <br>
  Following the luncheon a roundtable discussion is planned on the founding of women's studies. The event will feature a number of UCSC alumnae and faculty, including Nancy Lemon, a professor of law at Boalt Hall, UC Berkeley; retired attorney Cheryl Peake; Grace Hammond, a consultant for nonprofit organizations; and members of the UCSC faculty. The discussion takes place at 3:30 p.m. in Kresge Town Hall and is free and open to the public.<br>
  <br>
  Also planned in celebration of the program's anniversary is "Toward a Multicultural Women's History"--a residency by visiting scholars Darlene Clark Hine, professor of African American history at Michigan State University, and Vicki Ruiz, professor of Chicana history at Arizona State University. The residency takes place May 1-4 and features the following events:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Monday May 1, 4 p.m., Baobab Lounge, Merrill: "What's Color Got to Do with It: Representation, Segmentation, and Tactical Coalitions"<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Tuesday, May 2, 4 p.m., Silverman Conference Room, Stevenson College: Ruiz and Clark Hine will be joined by UCSC faculty (including Aptheker and professor of women's studies and literature Akasha Hull) for a roundtable discussion on "Toward a Multicultural Women's History"<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Thursday, May 4, 4 p.m., 159 Kresge: Darlene Clark Hine on "Black Women's Expressive Culture and Anti-Lynching Consciousness"

        <title>One of a kind: UCSC's first housing director is retiring</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 27 Mar 2000 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>8704</wp:post_id>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_8703" align="alignright" width="200"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/03/walters1.200.00-03-27.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-8703" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/03/walters1.200.00-03-27.jpg" alt="Jerry Walters (left) greets well-wishers at his reception.

<p>
  Many people retire from a job wanting to believe that their years of service made a difference. That their place of employment is better off because of their efforts.
</p>Jerry Walters, who retires from UCSC at the end of March after 35 years on the job, most of it as UCSC's first director of housing, has no trouble visualizing his impact. At UCSC, which houses almost half of its students on campus (by far the highest percentage in the UC system), the manifestations of his work are difficult to miss.<br>
<br>
But Walters is the last person to claim credit for UCSC's housing accomplishments. "Jerry may be the only person I've ever known about whom I've never heard a negative comment," said Harry LeGrande, head of housing at UC Berkeley and one of many people--mostly past and present UCSC employees--to attend Walters' going-away reception at Cowell College on March 17.<br>
<br>
Emceed by Francisco Hernandez, vice chancellor of student affairs, the event was a send-off for a person who has helped build UCSC, literally from the ground up.<br>
<br>
Speakers like Hal Hyde--the campus's first vice chancellor of business and finance and the person who hired Walters as a senior clerk in October 1964, a year before the campus opened to students--recalled some particularly nostalgic "Jerry" moments:
<ul>
  <li>Like his in-the-line-of-fire duty as a leader of the security team for then-California Governor Ronald Reagan, during a Regents meeting at Cowell College in 1968 that prompted a sizable anti-Vietnam War student demonstration.
  </li>
  <li>Or one of his early jobs, helping prepare UCSC's library for its opening after the arrival of the first shipment of--uncatalogued--books.
  </li>
  <li>Or another special assignment, organizing Ansel Adams' tours of the campus in the mid-1960s, visits that produced the photographer's classic early-UCSC series.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  But it's the work that Walters and his colleagues in housing have done providing on-campus accommodations for students these past decades that highlights his own personal reflections on 35 years at UCSC.<br>
  <br>
  "You think about how many tremendously bright and eager people have come through here," Walters said after the reception. "I feel that our work has touched a lot of lives."<br>
  <br>
</p>
<hr>
<p>
  In honor of Walters' years of service to UCSC, the campus has established the Jerome B. Walters Child Care Fund, benefiting UCSC child care programs. Contributions should be made payable to the UC Santa Cruz Foundation and mailed to:<br>
  <br>
  Jerome B. Walters Child Care Fund<br>
  Attention: Donor Services<br>
  Carriage House, UCSC<br>
  1156 High Street<br>
  Santa Cruz, CA 95064

  <font color="#003399">UCSC ranked 11th in Peace Corps volunteers this year</font>
</h4>The <a href="http://www.peacecorps.gov/news/jan00feature.html">Peace Corps' annual list</a> of colleges and universities with the largest number of volunteers serving overseas puts UCSC in the number 11 spot along with UC Davis. Last year UCSC was 22nd in the rankings. UCSC has 60 volunteers serving this year. The only other UC campus with more graduates in the Peace Corps is UC Berkeley, with 71 volunteers.
<p>
  The Peace Corps will be recruiting 400 more volunteers this year, with plans to expand the program to 10,000 volunteers over the next few years. If you would like to find out more about opportunities in the Peace Corps, plan to attend one of two informational meetings in April. The first will be held on Wednesday, April 5, from 7 to 8:30 p.m. at Louden Nelson Community Center in downtown Santa Cruz, and the second on Thursday, April 6, from 1 to 2 p.m. at Oakes College, Guzman Lounge. Extensive information on the Peace Corps, including the experiences of current and past volunteers, is available on the <a href="http://www.peacecorps.gov/volunteer/index.html">Peace Corps' Web site.</a>

  <font color="#003399">Help get the word out about the Census in Beach Flats</font>
</h4>
<p>
  On Sunday, April 2, the Beach Flats Community Center and La Familia Center will be holding an event at the Beach Flats Park with food, music, and information about the Census. The Census is a very important opportunity to be counted for funding of community programs. Due to fear of incarceration or deportation many undocumented individuals do not fill out their Census forms. Others do not fill out the form because they simply cannot understand what it says. Volunteers are needed from 1 to 6 p.m. to help serve food, collect Census forms, and for set up and clean up at the event. Spanish speakers would be useful but are not a must. For more information, contact Carmen Rojas at crojas3892@hotmail.com.

        <title>Leading Russian political strategist to discuss election results on April 5</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  One of Russia's leading political strategists will discuss the outcome of Russia's presidential election during a free public talk on Wednesday, April 5, from 7 to 9 p.m., in the Baobab Lounge at Merrill College. Vyacheslav Igrunov, the chief organizer for Russia's leading democratic party, Yabloko, and the director of Grigorii Yavlinsky's current presidential campaign, will discuss "Russia's Presidential Elections: The Yeltsin Succession and What Comes Next." His visit is being sponsored by UCSC's Politics and History Departments. "Igrunov will discuss how the Russian presidential election on March 26 figures into the drama of Russian politics and what we can expect in its wake," said Michael Urban, professor of politics and chair of the Politics Department. Igrunov, who has been a member of Russia's parliament since 1993, is the founder of an archive for the democratic movement in Russia that Urban calls "the best single source of information on democracy in Russia." He is also director of the Institute for Humanities and Political Studies in Moscow, a highly regarded private social science research institution that was the first nongovernmental research institution organized in Russia since the 1917 revolution. With a long history of political dissidence behind him, Igrunov has emerged as one of Russia's most effective political organizers. His visit to UCSC will be preceded by talks at UC Berkeley and Stanford University.

<p>
  When it opens in the spring, the new National Government Center in downtown Saitama, Japan, will become one of the busiest pedestrian corners of the world, with some 50,000 people crossing the plaza each day. As they traverse the area, inevitably, many of those people will raise their wrists and glance downwards to check on the time.<br>
  <br>
</p>Artist Nobuho Nagasawa, who is installing a public work in the plaza, hopes that by the time she's finished, a glance downward will evoke a more primordial sense of time.<br>
<br>
Nagasawa's project, commissioned by the Ministry of Construction in Japan, covers 15,700 square feet of the plaza with an iridescent lunar calendar that is periodically sprayed by a mist fountain.<br>
<br>
"The genesis of this proposal was to question the concept of people's perception of time and space in the contemporary urban world," said Nagasawa, an assistant professor of art at the University of California, Santa Cruz.<br>
<br>
Nagasawa explains that, "Throughout ancient civilizations, the moon was one of the important factors used to measure time. One of the ancient customs that still remains in the Japanese calendar is a day to observe the moon. However, contemporary urban Japanese people, who only look at their wristwatches, have forgotten how to experience time as they would in this ritual."<br>
<br>
The fountain that Nagasawa incorporates in her project evokes another ancient Japanese method of timekeeping, one that Nagasawa says dates from the seventh century. "Water, dripping from a series of vessels, was used to keep track of time," she explains. "I chose to use the element of water in the form of a mist fountain to add another dimension to the perceptual experience of the plaza."<br>
<br>
Images of the 28 phases of the moon are set into the ground in a pattern signifying the cycle of the moon. The material used to make the moons includes a glow-in-the-dark phosphor that maintains an unearthly blue glow long into the night with a material developed and manufactured especially for this project. "As dusk approaches, the plaza will become a magic carpet, as blue light glows from within the moon, while luminescence rises from the mist fountain," she said.<br>
<br>
Time is a theme of ongoing interest to Nagasawa, whose works have been exhibited around the word, from Prague, Czech Republic, to Aachen, Germany; to Mexico City; to New York and Los Angeles.<br>
<br>
Nagasawa describes her pieces as "site-specific" installations because they reflect the history and environment of their place. She never conceives an idea until she has visited a site and then, through her hands, she builds works that are part history, part poetry, and undeniably stunning.<br>
<br>
Her piece in Prague, a replica of the 12th-century Charles Bridge in sandbags and barbed wire, invoked multiple layers of the region's history, emphasized by a Bohemian crystal hourglass placed alongside the piece. (The first person to turn the hourglass when the piece was installed in 1993 was Czech Republic President Vaclav Havel.)<br>
<br>
A light sculpture she created for a station on Los Angeles's Metro Red Line evokes the history of the area, which served as an arrival area for immigrants much like Ellis and Angel Islands. Nagasawa conceived a light sculpture for the site as a symbol of the safe end of a journey. When the station is constructed, modern commuters may see the light as a friendly beacon as well--a signal of their homecoming. An award-winning work for an L.A. library recalls the nation's history of book censorship and at the same time, with hand-carved stools spelling out "imagination," pointed to the positive function of a library to society.<br>
<br>
Another piece due for completion this spring is a collaboration with a landscape artist for the McEnery Children's Park in downtown San Jose. Nagasawa designed wind vane sculptures in the form of insects. The idea, she said, was inspired by the park's proximity to the Guadalupe River. "These insects, dragonflies in particular, are important monitors of river ecology," she explains. "And the dragonfly is considered to be one of the most ancient species, having survived since the Jurassic period." Nagasawa hopes the sculpture will "reawaken our relationship to the wind, sun, and water--the fundamental source of life in this urban park. It also celebrates the Guadalupe River that gives life to the flora and fauna and the people of San Jose."<br>
<br>
Through a commission from the San Francisco Arts Commission, Nagasawa has been working with a landscape architect on improvements to an 860-foot-long public access area along the Islais Creek near the I-280 freeway in San Francisco. "The design recognizes the work of indigenous peoples as well as the more recent waterfront industries that shaped the current identity of the site," she explained. Nagasawa discovered that the site once supported shipbuilding and coconut-refining industries. To evoke these themes, she has created a suspended-steel sculpture outlining the form of a ship. That project is due to be completed sometime this year.<br>
<br>
Another project due to be completed this year is in the City of Stockton. Derivi Castellanos Architects are overseeing an innovative overhaul of the Arch Road and Highway 99 interchange, envisioned as a gateway to the city. Nagasawa has been commissioned to create the artistic vision for the project, which includes a sound wall, retaining wall, and freeway interchange bridge. Wanting to evoke the industrial and agricultural history of Stockton, as well as the current function of the space, Nagasawa developed a collage of abstract patterns inspired by various transportation modes--historic wagon wheels, tractors, contemporary industrial tools and parts, all abstracted and repeated.<br>
<br>
These are only some of the many pieces the artist is immersed in over the next few years. Other projects are in the works in San Francisco, Seattle, and Japan. Nagasawa will also be featured in a soon-to-be-released book titled "Contemporary Artists in the Bay Area," compiled by editors from the City of Los Angeles and San Jose Cultural Affairs Departments.

  <br>
  In looking back over a year of theater, <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> theater critic Steven Winn named the <b>Shakespeare Santa Cruz</b> production of <i>Arms and the Man</i> as one of the best ten productions in the region for 1999. The play was directed by theater arts professor <b>Paul Whitworth</b> who, Winn said, "confidently mastered (George Bernard) Shaw's satiric study of military muddlers with one of the region's most sparkling classic productions of the year."<br>
</p>

<p>
  The <i>Santa Cruz County Sentinel</i> ran an item about UCSC's role in NASA's Gamma ray Large Area Space Telescope, mentioning astronomer <b>Stephen Thorsett</b> and the Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics (SCIPP).
</p>

<p>
  The <b>UCSC Orchestra and Chamber Singers</b>, conductor <b>Nicole Paiement</b>, and pianist <b>Maria Ezerova</b> all received a glowing review from the music critic at the <i>Santa Cruz County Sentinel</i> following a recent performance. The critic wrote that they proved "classical music is flourishing on 'the hill.'" The critic went on to describe Ezerova as "amazingly powerful" with "fire and flair."
</p>

<p>
  In a story on a forthcoming California Agricultural Workers History Center in Watsonville, the <i>Santa Cruz County Sentinel</i> named <b>Geoffrey Dunn</b> of community studies as one of two local historians who helped envision and solidify the concept for the project, which was approved unanimously by the Watsonville City Council.<br>

<p>
  When the Lula Washington Dance Theatre performs in Santa Cruz on April 15, it will be the second visit here this academic year. And, in a very dancelike act of symmetry, the company will perform a piece conceived, in part, during the previous visit. That visit was sponsored by UCSC's Arts & Lectures program, which is presenting the upcoming performance.
</p>The company, which celebrates its 20th anniversary this year, is one of southern California's best-known African American dance troupes. Choreographer Lula Washington has developed a distinctive style for her company that is athletic and theatrical. Washington also uses her pieces to voice social and political themes--previous pieces have addressed such events and issues as the Rodney King beating, Washington's nephew's gang-related murder, abortion, and abused women.<br>
<br>
The company's distinction comes not only from its political sensibilities and supercharged dance styles, but from the music it uses. Washington grew up listening to Motown and the blues, and she uses the music she loves in her work--Ray Charles, Marvin Gaye, Tina Turner, B. B. King, Bobbie Blue Bland, Etta James, Smokey Robinson, Duke Ellington, and Bob Marley are among the musicians whose work she has used.<br>
<br>
But this past year, Washington decided it was time for a change. And so, while much of the Santa Cruz show will be trademark Washington, a new piece--"Rites 2000"--features classical music by Vivaldi, Stravinsky, Chopin, Bach, and John Tavener. "Rites" is the piece that Washington developed in Santa Cruz and in other community workshops around the country. It was also made possible, in part, through a commission by seven organizations, including UCSC's Arts & Lectures.<br>
<br>
"I've never used classical music before and it was a personal challenge for me, a way to move into the new millennium," says Washington of her uncharacteristic choice. "I had already decided I wanted to experiment with classical music and my first thought was Stravinsky's 'Rite of Spring.' It's a great piece, but I couldn't connect with it, the music didn't work for me. But when I started thinking in a slightly different direction, it began to work. In fact, when I found the right music, it helped me to create and civilize the stories."<br>
<br>
Washington and company members (who include her husband, executive director Erwin Washington, and her daughter, critically acclaimed dancer Tamica Washington) have been working on the piece in their Los Angeles studio, but many of their ideas, and even some of their movements, have been culled from school and public workshops.<br>
<br>
"Lula has been interviewing community groups of all sorts to help her form this piece," says Martin Wollesen, director of Arts & Lectures at UCSC. "In our area she visited high schools in Santa Cruz and San Jose with some of her dancers. They interviewed the students about their dreams and aspirations for the new millennium and had them create their own dance piece based on how they saw themselves." (The Santa Cruz- and San Jose-area outreach was made possible by support from UCSC's Outreach, Admissions, and Student Academic Services program.)<br>
<br>
When it comes to bringing arts into the community, Arts & Lectures and the Lula Washington Dance Theatre share the same vision. "We are interested in bringing arts to students of all ages in the community, many of whom may ultimately wind up attending UCSC," Wollesen explains. Many of Arts & Lectures' featured performers and speakers conduct workshops during their stay in Santa Cruz, working with everyone from UCSC students to kindergartners to the general public.<br>
<br>
As well known as the company is for performance, the Lula Washington Dance Theatre is also renowned for its outreach activity. Washington's company supports youth ensembles, and company members also teach after-school and weekend classes to low-income children. The troupe also performs in public schools in L.A. and across the country, and a program Washington established in 1983, "I Do Dance Not Drugs," continues to help redirect at-risk youth.<br>
<br>
"I like kids," Washington says. "I have a lot of fun with them. I feel like you can learn from anybody. I started very late and wanted to be part of something that would give back to kids at a younger age. There are not enough professional dancers who enjoy working with younger kids and to bring that enrichment to their lives makes such a difference."<br>
<br>
"We're hoping that the outreach will motivate the kids to want to come and see the show and seek out dance as an alternative way of using their time and energy and a way of exploring the possibilities of telling their own stories."<br>
<br>
Washington didn't begin her dance career until she was 22 (and then, only after actively lobbying the UCLA dance department to admit her, despite her age). But, because of her teaching efforts, many other promising dancers have been able to begin their careers at a much younger age, and former students have gone on to perform with Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, Donald Byrd Dance Theatre, Dance Theatre of Harlem, and on Broadway.<br>
<br>
Along with the performance, the troupe will conduct a master class with UCSC dance students as well as a community workshop. For workshop information, call (831) 459-3861. For tickets to the performance, call (831) 459-2159.

<p>
  A delegation of 19 senior administrators from Peking University in China visited UCSC last week as part of their tour of major U.S. universities. The delegation met with UCSC faculty and toured Long Marine Laboratory, the Seymour Marine Discovery Center, and Cowell College.
</p>The distinguished visitors, who had already spent several weeks at UC Berkeley, were interested in learning about UCSC's residential colleges, Education Abroad programs, graduate programs, and special research initiatives.<br>
<br>
They had a particular interest in UCSC's marine science programs. Peking University recently acquired 800 acres of land in the coastal city of Tsing Tao to build a major satellite campus. Tsing Tao is known throughout China for its world-class research in marine sciences, aquaculture, and oceanography. The Chinese National Academy's Institute of Oceanology is located there.<br>
<br>
With its high concentration of marine science institutes and researchers, Tsing Tao is comparable to U.S. centers of marine research such as Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, Scripps Institution of Oceanography, and the Monterey Bay region, said Lynda Goff, vice provost and dean of undergraduate education, who helped organize the visit.<br>
<br>
"Tsing Tao's natural seaside setting and existing excellence in ocean sciences and marine biology will be a tremendous asset to the new university," Goff said.<br>
<br>
"The delegation was particularly interested in the Seymour Marine Discovery Center, and they were impressed with its role in teaching schoolchildren and connecting UCSC and its marine scientists with the surrounding community," she added.<br>
<br>
The delegation's tour of the Seymour Center was led by Lisa Borok, head of visitor programs for the center. The visit to Long Marine Lab also included a tour of the marine mammal pools, where resident dolphins Primo and Puka demonstrated their energetic contributions to research on dolphin physiology.<br>
<br>
"This was a fine day for both our institutions, and we hope that future partnerships between the new Tsing Tao campus and UCSC will provide increased educational and research opportunities for all of our students and faculty," Goff said.<br>
<br>
The Peking University delegation also plans to visit UC Davis, UCLA, UC Irvine, and USC, as well as several East Coast universities.

</h4>

<p>
  <img align="right" border="0" height="152" src="../art/williams_quentin.125.jpg" width="125" alt="">The American Geophysical Union (AGU) has awarded professor of earth sciences Quentin Williams the <a href="http://earth.agu.org/inside/honors.html">Macelwane Medal for 2000</a>. The Macelwane Medal is the highest honor bestowed upon young researchers by the AGU.<br>
  <br>
  Established in 1961 and renamed in 1986 in honor of James B. Macelwane, this medal recognizes significant contributions to the geophysical sciences by an outstanding young scientist (less than 36 years of age). Macelwane, the AGU's 13th president, was renowned not just for his contributions to geophysics but also for his deep interest in teaching and encouraging young scientists.<br>
  <br>
  The medal adds to a growing list of honors for Williams, who also won the Mineralogical Society of America Award for 2000 and was a National Science Foundation Presidential Faculty Fellow from 1993 to 1998.<br>
  <br>
  Three faculty in the Earth Sciences Department have now received the Macelwane Medal: professor and chair Thorne Lay, professor Marcia McNutt, and Williams. Only a handful of other universities, including Harvard, Stanford, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, have three or more Macelwane medalists on their faculties.<br>

<p>
  More than 400 University of California alumni and other friends of the university gathered March 13-14 for "UC Day in Sacramento," the annual legislative conference of the Alumni Associations of the University of California (AAUC).
</p>Conference delegates met in small groups with 95 percent of the members of the Legislature or their staffs. The delegates made a strong pitch for the university's plans to accommodate enrollment growth in the next decade, for UC's dramatically expanding activities with the K-12 public schools, and for the university's research activities that benefit students as well as the California economy.<br>
<br>
They also advocated for the state budget proposals that Gov. Gray Davis has made to support these important efforts.<br>
<br>
"The strong participation of alumni from all of our campuses made UC Day a real success," said Kent Vining, president of the AAUC. "It was gratifying to see so many people who have retained strong ties to the university and who are so committed to securing a bright future for UC. They made a strong case to the Legislature on the university's behalf."<br>
<br>
In addition to meeting with state lawmakers, alumni delegates gathered for morning sessions centered on the conference theme, "A UC Century of Discovery." The sessions highlighted opportunities for undergraduate research at UC and the ways in which those research opportunities enrich the undergraduate experience.<br>
<br>
Sixteen undergraduate students representing all eight UC general campuses displayed posters illustrating research they are conducting, in areas ranging from Brazilian economics to the genetics of avocados. Two UCSC students, Joseph Rodriguez and Jennifer Leech, were selected from a pool of 60 outstanding undergraduate researchers systemwide whose abstracts were submitted by the campuses. Each of the winners was introduced to the audience and presented with a certificate of commendation.
<p>
  Rodriguez, a UCSC biology undergraduate studying under Assistant Professor Ingrid Parker, is researching the adaptive abilities of an invasive plant, <i>Verbascum thaspus</i>, in Yosemite National Park. "If the results correspond to my predictions, this research will represent one of the first demonstrations of adaptation in an invasive species and will provide National Park resource managers with a more comprehensive understanding of this problematic weed," Rodriguez said.
</p>
<p>
  For Rodriguez, conducting research with ecologists has given him the chance to work on "an important problem with real-world implications. This project has allowed me to assume responsibility for my education and embrace it in a way I never have before," Rodriguez said.
</p>
<p>
  Leech, a UCSC computer engineering student studying under Associate Professor Richard Hughey, is working with two other students on a high-speed parallel processor computer called "Kestrel."
</p>
<p>
  A separate forum on undergraduate research featured students from UC Davis and UC Irvine who, with their faculty advisers, shared their research experiences with the alumni delegates.<br>
  <br>
  "It was the most beneficial experience I had at UC Irvine," said Marisa Magana, a recent graduate in biology whose research on nutritional regulation of the fatty acid synthase gene has important implications for the understanding of heart disease and diabetes. "I could really see how research complemented my learning. It really has taught me how to think critically and how to problem-solve. It has taught me a lot about patience."<br>
  <br>
  UC faculty members attending the forum said that parents and the public need to understand that research benefits undergraduate education, rather than being in competition with it. They also stressed that many undergraduates produce significant research findings that are published in journals or presented at academic conferences.<br>
  <br>
  "We're not just teaching students how to do research. They are making substantial contributions in their own field," said Lynda Goff, vice provost and dean of undergraduate education at UC Santa Cruz, who, along with Judi Smith, vice provost for undergraduate education at UCLA, co-moderated the undergraduate research forum.<br>
  <br>
  "They don't just get a research experience out of it. It's a real teaching tool," said Timothy Osborne, professor of molecular biology and biochemistry at UC Irvine.<br>
  <br>
  Elsewhere at the conference, the Alumni Associations honored two "Legislators of the Year," state Senator Steve Peace of El Cajon and Assemblyman Dennis Cardoza of Merced. (For more, read <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/currents/99-00/03-20/legi.html">UC honors 'legislators of the year'</a>)<br>
  <br>
  UC President Richard C. Atkinson also addressed the delegates, as did John G. Davies, chairman of the UC Board of Regents, along with other Regents and alumni leaders. Alumni delegates to the conference pay for their own transportation and accommodations.<br>

<p>
  By all accounts, the grand opening of the Seymour Center at Long Marine Laboratory on March 11 and 12 was a huge success. More than 2,000 people visited the center on each day of the grand opening weekend for a total of about 4,500 visitors.
</p>
<p>
  The Ocean Discovery Shop did brisk business, selling out of some of the most popular items. And the Friends of Long Marine Lab signed up 163 new members over the weekend, said Lisa Rose, executive director of the friends group, which helps support the Seymour Center and other programs at the lab.<br>
  <br>
  The burst of activity at the Seymour Center continued right into the following week and shows no signs of slowing down. "We are still really busy," Rose said.<br>
  <br>
  The center's programs for school groups are fully booked through the end of the school year, said center director Julie Barrett Heffington.<br>
  <br>
  The Seymour Center is open Tuesday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Sunday from noon to 5 p.m. Admission is $5 for adults; $3 for students, seniors, and youth (ages 6 to 16); and free for children age 5 and under. Admission is free for members.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  In recognition of their distinguished service and dedication to higher education in California, state Senator Steve Peace of El Cajon and Assemblyman Dennis Cardoza of Merced were honored as "Legislators of the Year" on March 14 by the Alumni Associations of the University of California (AAUC). The awards were presented at a breakfast meeting of UC alumni gathered in Sacramento for the AAUC's annual legislative conference. Peace, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, was recognized for his support of the university's efforts to maintain high-quality programs in a time of significant enrollment growth. "Senator Peace has been a leading advocate for the University of California," said Kent Vining, president of the AAUC. "He understands the importance of preserving quality educational programs while providing a place at the university for all eligible students, and he has been instrumental in securing the state support necessary for UC to continue pursuing both missions." Peace has led legislative efforts to maintain state support for the university's core budget, provide increases for chronically underfunded needs such as deferred maintenance and instructional equipment, and ensure that the state budget allows UC to maintain its commitments under the Master Plan for Higher Education to all eligible students seeking an education at the university. He also authored SB 1896, a 5 percent fee reduction for graduate academic students, which mirrored a similar student fee cut for undergraduates. "Senator Peace has been a strong ongoing supporter of the University of California and of the important role it plays in our state," said UC San Diego Chancellor Robert C. Dynes. "We value his understanding of the issues, his wise advice and counsel, and his commitment to quality, access and affordability in higher education." The Alumni Associations recognized Cardoza for his strong ongoing support of the university and its operating and capital budgets. Cardoza also has been a leading advocate on behalf of UC's Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources, and he provided important support for legislative approval of a statewide education bond measure in 1998. "Assemblyman Cardoza has been a great friend of the University of California," Vining said. "His supportive efforts will benefit many future generations of UC alumni and will help the university retain its well-deserved international reputation as a center of academic excellence and educational opportunity." Cardoza also was honored for his substantial efforts on behalf of UC Merced, which will be the university's first campus in the San Joaquin Valley. Cardoza has played an important role in securing state funds for the development of UC Merced and for Merced County's planning costs associated with the new campus. "Assemblyman Cardoza has been one of our key supporters, and his advocacy for UC Merced in the Legislature has been critical to our success," said UC Merced Chancellor Carol Tomlinson-Keasey. "His efforts have demonstrated an unwavering commitment to fulfilling the educational aspirations of the children of the San Joaquin Valley." The AAUC presents its Legislator of the Year award annually to one member of the Senate and one member of the Assembly. The AAUC governing board selects the award recipients from campus nominations of state legislators who have been outstanding supporters of the University of California.

<p>
  UCSC scientists are now involved in several aspects of NASA's Gamma ray Large Area Space Telescope (GLAST), scheduled for launch in 2005. After years of planning and evaluation of proposals, NASA announced in February the main investigations on which the project will focus.<br>
  <br>
</p>The Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics (SCIPP) will take the lead in designing and building one of the principal components of the instrument, the silicon strip detectors used to record the direction of gamma rays. In addition, a proposal by associate professor of astronomy and astrophysics Stephen Thorsett was chosen as one of four "interdisciplinary scientist investigations" to broaden the scientific expertise involved in the project.<br>
<br>
GLAST will explore the most energetic and violent events in the universe. Scientists will use the instrument to investigate objects such as distant galaxies powered by supermassive black holes at their centers, remnants of stars that have exploded as supernovae, and many other phenomena at the extremes of mass and energy.<br>
<br>
GLAST will be built and used by an international collaboration involving more than 20 institutions from six countries. The Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC) will oversee the design and construction of the main instrument, with Stanford physics professor Peter Michelson as principal investigator. NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland is in charge of the mission as a whole, including the spacecraft that will carry the telescope.<br>
<br>
SCIPP researchers, led by associate professor of physics Robert Johnson, have been working with SLAC for several years on a proposal for GLAST, but NASA was also evaluating a competing proposal.<br>
<br>
"We were working under the assumption that we would do the project, but NASA's decision formalizes it," Johnson said. "We have a complete prototype of the instrument that we've tested recently at SLAC, but now we have to bear down and do the serious engineering work needed for a space-based application."<br>
<br>
The GLAST project will probe the rich variety of astronomical phenomena that emit high-energy gamma rays. Compared to existing high-energy telescopes, GLAST will have a field of view six times larger and a sensitivity more than 50 times greater. It will also be able to measure the energy of gamma rays over an unprecedented range.<br>
<br>
Thorsett's project will use GLAST to study gamma rays emitted by pulsars. Pulsars are the collapsed cores of massive stars left behind after supernova explosions. Spinning rapidly in deep space, a pulsar sends flashes of radiation sweeping across Earth like the beam of a lighthouse.<br>
<br>
"Although pulsars were discovered by detecting the energy they emit in radio wavelengths, most of the energy they emit is in x-rays or gamma rays, so the energy range of GLAST is a natural place to study the physics of pulsars," Thorsett said.<br>
<br>
He plans to combine observations from radio telescopes on the ground with GLAST's observations to study the physics of the radiation processes in pulsars.<br>
<br>
The design for GLAST bears little resemblance to conventional telescopes with lenses and mirrors. The primary instrument is an array of towers composed of thin lead foil interleaved with thin silicon detectors, followed by a matrix of scintillation crystals. The silicon detectors, designed by SCIPP, measure gamma ray direction, while the scintillation crystals measure the gamma ray energy.<br>
<br>
With about 80 square meters of silicon strip detectors, GLAST will be by far the largest silicon-based detector ever launched into space, Johnson said. Joining Johnson on the project are adjunct professor of physics Hartmut Sadrozinski, several postdoctoral researchers, and a cadre of highly skilled engineers and technicians. Several UCSC undergraduates are also involved in the project.<br>
<br>
In addition to the scientific investigations, the GLAST project includes a public education component aimed at students from kindergarten to college levels. Although the details of this component have not been worked out yet, SCIPP's outreach programs have already brought local high school science teachers into the lab to learn about the institute's work on silicon strip detectors.<br>
<br>
Both the instrument itself and the phenomena to be studied make GLAST a natural vehicle for getting students interested in science, Thorsett noted. "We will be studying some of the most exotic phenomena in the universe," he said.

        <title>More summer classes key to UC enrollment plans</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  Expanded summer instruction will be a key component of the University of California's efforts to accommodate enrollment growth over the next decade, assuming that necessary state financial support is provided, UC officials told the Board of Regents March 16. "Expanding instruction during the summer will make efficient use of our facilities, help some students graduate earlier, reduce the impacts of growth during the traditional academic year, and provide innovative new academic opportunities," said C. Judson King, UC provost and senior vice president for academic affairs. "We are ready to move forward on this exciting and challenging task, and the support of the state is crucial to our success." Growth in California's college-age population is expected to increase UC's general-campus enrollment by 63,000 full-time-equivalent students between 1998-99 and 2010-11. This 43 percent increase equals the university's growth over the last 30 years and also is roughly equivalent to the combined enrollments of UC Berkeley and UCLA. The university is pursuing a range of options for accommodating this growth. Strategies include expanding regular on-campus enrollments during the fall, winter and spring terms; opening the new UC Merced campus; offering more instructional programs at off-campus centers; making use of advances in educational technology; and improving students' time to graduation. Expanding instruction during the summer term is another important strategy, and the Legislature has asked UC to report by April 1 on the feasibility of this option. Providing an overview of the report's findings, UC officials told the Board of Regents today that about 27 percent of UC students now attend the university during the summer, virtually all of them part-time. The university believes it is possible to increase summer enrollments substantially. The state does not currently fund the summer session. UC is requesting that the state change this policy so that students attending in the summer pay fees and receive financial aid equivalent to that provided during the regular academic year, and also receive an academic experience comparable in quality to the rest of the year. State funding for the existing summer session would cost the state about $54 million per year, and future enrollment growth in the summer would receive the same per-student state funding as in the fall, winter and spring. "The state has expressed strong interest in an expanded summer term, and it is an essential part of our plans for accommodating this enrollment surge," said Larry Hershman, UC vice president for budget. "We look forward to working with Gov. Davis and the Legislature this spring on a plan to make this idea a reality, hopefully by the summer of 2001." Expanded summer instruction would allow some students to graduate earlier, making room for others. It would reduce the traffic and housing impacts that would occur during the traditional academic year if all growth took place in the fall, winter and spring. It also would provide students and faculty with innovative educational opportunities in less-crowded settings. UC needs about $500 million per year in funding for capital facilities over the next decade, ranging from construction of new buildings for enrollment growth to renovation and seismic reinforcement of existing facilities. Expansion of the summer term could save up to $30 million per year in UC's capital budget by reducing the need for new classrooms and class laboratories. King said the university is considering a variety of incentives to encourage student and faculty interest in the summer term. Faculty would continue to teach three quarters per year, and the addition of the summer as part of the regular academic year would allow professors to utilize a different part of the year for intensive research activities. Incentives for students might include such things as increased financial aid; short, intensive courses; courses tailored to the sophomore or senior summer; special laboratory and clinical experiences; classes designed for incoming students; and expanded summer Education Abroad programs. Other ideas also are under consideration. UC officials also presented to the Board of Regents a list of 10 "principles for expanded enrollment" that will guide the university's planning. The principles are: sustaining UC's commitment to the Master Plan for Higher Education, ensuring quality, fostering graduate education and research amid undergraduate enrollment growth, ensuring the participation of all campuses and providing them local flexibility in implementation, ensuring affordability for students, securing adequate operating funds from the state, providing adequate space for growth, expediting students' time to degree, protecting important public service programs that occur on campus during the summer, and working well with local communities.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_8676" align="alignright" width="200"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/03/bike.00-03-20.200.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-8676" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/03/bike.00-03-20.200.jpg" alt="Biking up the campus hills in the morning is now an option with the new bike shuttles.

<p>
  For members of the campus community who want to bike up to campus on these sunny days but find the hills a bit too daunting, help is on the way. Transportation & Parking Services (TAPS) is offering two different shuttle services with bike racks that will help bicycle commuters make it up the hill. Gravity will take the cyclists down the hill at the end of the day.
</p>With more than 11,000 students and 3,500 staff and faculty vying for 5,000 parking spaces, TAPS is finding ways to support transportation that will decrease parking and traffic demands. Bicycles are already a popular alternative, and the new shuttle services are among the programs that serve bicycle commuters.<br>
<br>
"TAPS is putting a lot of energy into supporting any alternative to a single occupancy vehicle," said Wes Scott, director of TAPS. "We're trying to find ways to get bikes up to campus."<br>
<br>
<b>Bike shuttles</b><br>
<br>
At the beginning of April, TAPS will offer a bike shuttle that will pick up bikers at the parking lot of Marcelo's Restaurant at Mission and Bay Streets and drop them off at the Physical Plant bus stop, Cowell Circle, and Baskin Engineering (near the Mail Services loading dock).<br>
<br>
The shuttle, which can carry 14 bikes, will operate from 7 a.m. to 10 a.m. at 30-minute intervals. TAPS may arrange 20- or 15-minute pick-up times as demand necessitates.<br>
<br>
To accommodate bikers, Marcelo's Restaurant, which previously opened at 11 a.m., will now open at 7 a.m. for coffee service and pastries.<br>
<br>
In another innovation to encourage bicycle commuting, TAPS is equipping ten campus Day Perimeter Shuttles with bicycle racks that carry two bikes each. This service is expected to start at the beginning of April. Bikers can load their bikes at the Physical Plant bus stop every ten minutes and can unload at the Baskin Engineering bus stop or the College Eight/Porter College bus stop.<br>
<br>
"With these new programs, we should be able to move close to 400 bikes a day with both programs working at full efficiency," said Scott.<br>
<br>
For more information call TAPS at (831) 459-3228.<br>
<br>
<b>Bike parking</b><br>
<br>
Additional bike parking around the campus will be installed in the coming months. The funds came from a grant from the Santa Cruz County Regional Transportation Commission.<br>
<br>
In April there will be new bike racks at the parking lot of Marcelo's Restaurant by the bus stop on Bay Street. This rack was funded by Federal Surface Transportation Funds for Congestion, Mitigation, and Air Quality.<br>
<br>
<b>Electric Bikes</b><br>
<br>
For cyclists who want assistance getting around the hilly campus, electric bikes are now on sale at discounted prices at the Bay Tree Bookstore. The "on-demand" electric power offers a top speed of 15 mph and a range of about 20 miles.<br>
<br>
A midrange "comfort model," which comes with a tote bag and rack, is priced at $999 plus tax (the regular retail price is $1,145 plus $49 shipping). The special prices are available to the campus community through an arrangement with EV Global, a Lee Iacocca Enterprise, and Subaru of Santa Cruz. The comfort model comes with a suspension seat post and a gel saddle; saddle bags are optional.<br>
<br>
For more information about e-bikes, contact the Bay Tree Bookstore at (831) 459-4001 or visit <a href="http://www.ebike.com">the e-bike Web site</a>.<br>
<br>
<b>Zero interest bike loans</b><br>
<br>
Zero interest loans for bicycles and e-bikes are available to UCSC faculty and staff who meet certain criteria. Bike loan information and applications are available at the bookstore and by contacting Candice Ward in TAPS at (831) 459-5495.<br>
<br>
<b>Free bicycle maintenance</b><br>
<br>
Those campus member who want to ride to campus but can't because their bikes' gears grind and wheels wobble can fix their bikes at the free drop-in bike maintenance program. The service at the Recreation Office porch located at the East Field House is available every Friday from 2 to 5 p.m. from March 31 to June 2. Capable mechanics are available to help fix and tune-up bikes. This program is sponsored by TAPS and OPERS.<br>
<br>
For more information, call OPERS at (831) 459-2806.<br>
<br>
<b>Bicycle licensing</b><br>
<br>
Licensing a bike can increase the chance of recovering the bike if it is stolen. Bike licensing and renewals are available for $3 and are valid statewide. Licensing is available every Friday from 2 to 5 p.m. from March 31 to June 2 at the Recreation Office porch of the East Field House. Additional licensing opportunities can be arranged with TAPS by calling (831) 459-5495.<br>
<br>
All licensing fees go back to the TAPS bicycle program to provide bicycling enhancements to the campus. TAPS and OPERS are sponsoring this project.<br>
<br>
<b>Bike commuter shower program</b><br>
<br>
Faculty and staff who commute by bike may register to participate in the Bike Commuter Shower Program. Participants gain free access to the shower facilities at both the East and West Field Houses and are provided with a short-term locker and towel. Faculty and staff can register with the TAPS Sales Office near the base of campus or call (831) 459-4543.<br>

</p>

<p>
  <img align="right" border="0" height="160" src="../art/gregoret.125.jpg" width="125" alt="">The Biophysical Society has awarded Lydia Gregoret, assistant professor of chemistry and biochemistry, the Margaret Oakley Dayhoff Award for 2000. The award honors the memory of Margaret Dayhoff, former president of the Biophysical Society, professor of biophysics at Georgetown University, and director of research at the National Biomedical Research Foundation.<br>
  <br>
  The award, which includes a $2,000 prize, is presented each year to a woman scientist "of very high promise who has not yet reached a position of high recognition."<br>
  <br>
  Gregoret's research addresses the problem of how protein molecules fold into the complex shapes that help determine their special properties. "I am extremely honored to receive an award named for Margaret Dayhoff, since I consider her one of the pioneers of my field," Gregoret said.<br>
  <br>
  Margaret Dayhoff's husband, Edward Dayhoff, presented the award to Gregoret in February at the Biophysical Society's annual meeting. "[Gregoret's] recent papers represent conceptually groundbreaking work and are expected to be a powerful tool for answering the question of how amino acid sequences of proteins determine their three-dimensional structures," he said.

        <title>UCSC outlines 'planning principles' for development of marine research and education center on Terrace Point property</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 13 Mar 2000 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>

        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  A UC Santa Cruz planning committee, working with representatives of the city of Santa Cruz and the California Coastal Commission, has taken the first step toward planning a marine research and education center on the 55-acre property commonly referred to as Terrace Point. The committee has completed work on a document entitled <i>Planning Principles: Marine Research and Education Center.</i> The publication outlines the planning process that will be used for the project and identifies some of the broad development issues that subsequent studies will need to address. "The committee's work is intended to clarify the university's thinking about the property and give guidance to the consultant we will be hiring to develop a detailed master plan for the site," says Charles Eadie, UCSC's director of campus and community planning. The <i>Planning Principles</i> document states the university's intention for the property: to create a "world-class" marine research and education center, incorporating UCSC's Long Marine Laboratory, located next to the 55 acres; the Seymour Marine Discovery Center, which opened this past weekend (March 11-12) at the marine lab; and the Younger Lagoon Natural Reserve. The document also outlines five broad principles for the site's development:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Protect, maintain, and where feasible, enhance and restore the overall quality of the coastal zone environment and its natural and artificial resources.
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Assure orderly, balanced utilization and conservation of coastal zone resources, taking into account the social and economic needs of the people of the state.
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Maximize public access to and along the coast and maximize public recreational opportunities in the coastal zone consistent with sound resources conservation principles and constitutionally protected rights of private property owners.
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Assure priority for coastal-dependent and coastal-related development over other development on the coast.
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Encourage state and local initiatives and cooperation in preparing procedures to implement coordinated planning and development for mutually beneficial uses, including educational uses, in the coastal zone.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  The UC Regents last May purchased the Terrace Point property, which is located next to UCSC's Long Marine Laboratory. The oceanfront parcel had been the subject of two prior attempts by Wells Fargo Bank, the former owner, to create master plans for future development. The city of Santa Cruz had jurisdiction over each of those planning efforts, none of which were approved.<br>
  <br>
  In October, the university began a process of developing a Coastal Long Range Development Plan (CLRDP) for the property--a planning process that falls under the jurisdiction of the California Coastal Commission. UCSC's Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor John Simpson appointed the center's planning committee to oversee that process; the committee, which worked with the consulting firm of SRG Partnership, Inc., to produce the <i>Planning Principles</i> document, is cochaired by Gary Griggs, director of UCSC's Institute of Marine Sciences, and Tom Vani, vice chancellor for Business and Administrative Services.<br>
  <br>
  Griggs believes the planning process begun this past fall will ultimately produce a blueprint for a "world-class" marine research center on the property. As part of the process producing the <i>Planning Principles</i> document, the committee initiated the preliminary assessment of such world-class marine research centers as Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and Scripps Institution of Oceanography.<br>
  <br>
  The new process also gives the university an opportunity to approach the development of the parcel differently than could Wells Fargo, which made for-sale housing a chief component of its development proposals, Griggs said. "We won't be redoing the Wells plan. We're starting from scratch."<br>
  <br>
  The <i>Planning Principles</i> document says some housing on the property will be "critical to the development of a successful marine research and education center.... University housing options serving the marine-related mission of the center include accommodations for undergraduates, graduate students, post-doctorates, faculty, and visiting scholars."<br>
  <br>
  Other "key issues" identified by the document that will affect the site's development include site constraints, the need for open space and buffers, the need for additional studies concerning roads and parking, and the need to ensure pedestrian access to the coastline.<br>
  <br>
  UCSC, Coastal Commission, and city of Santa Cruz representatives participated in three workshops that helped produce the <i>Planning Principles</i> document.

<p>
  For its 19th season, <a href="http://shakespearesantacruz.org">Shakespeare Santa Cruz</a> will take its audiences across the ages, with plays set in ancient Britain, Renaissance France, and 19th-century England. The plays are Shakespeare's <i>Love's Labour's Lost,</i> directed by Daniel Fish; Shakespeare's <i>Cymbeline,</i> directed by Danny Scheie; and Jean Paul Sartre's <i>Kean,</i> directed by Michael Edwards.
</p>The season opens with preview performances on July 12, with all three plays open and running in repertory Tuesdays through Sundays between July 27 and August 27. To see a tentative performance schedule, please see the <a href="http://shakespearesantacruz.org/summer00/calendar.shtml">Festival Calendar</a>.<br>
<br>
The 2000 season features several popular Shakespeare Santa Cruz (SSC) veterans, including SSC artistic director Paul Whitworth, who will play the title role in <i>Kean,</i> and directors Edwards and Scheie, both of whom are former artistic directors of SSC and have, between them, directed dozens of plays for SSC, as well as across the globe. Fish has directed for the McCarter Theater, the Shakespeare Theater in Washington, D.C., Court Theater in Chicago, the Juilliard School, SUNY Purchase, and the New Jersey Shakespeare Festival, among others.<br>
<br>
The festival always offers a rich diversity of activities to complement the season's theatrical performances. Two of the most popular and long-standing events are the Weekend with Shakespeare conference and the Noon at the Nick luncheon lecture series.<br>
<br>
Weekend with Shakespeare is a three-day conference featuring lectures by leading scholars, panel presentations, tours and, of course, the plays themselves (tickets are not included in conference costs). This annual conference, sponsored by UCSC's Focused Research Activity in Shakespeare and Early Drama, provides an opportunity to explore the links between scholarship and performance. Weekend with Shakespeare will run August 11-13 at the Theater Arts Center. The cost is $40 per person for the six discussion/lectures.<br>
<br>
Noon at the Nick is a free brown-bag discussion series at the Nickelodeon Theater at 210 Lincoln Street in downtown Santa Cruz. Lively discussions will feature festival directors, actors, and designers. Lectures begin at noon and run July 7-August 4.<br>
<br>
SSC now offers special family prices through its Family Sundays program. On each of the five Sunday matinee performances during the season, patrons may buy up to two special $6 youth tickets with the purchase of each adult ticket. Tickets prices are valid for children aged 5 to 18.<br>
<br>
For tickets and more information, call (831) 459-2159.<br>
<br>
Below are synopses of the plays, which can also be found at the <a href="http://shakespearesantacruz.org/">Shakespeare Santa Cruz Web site.</a>
<h3>
  <b>Love's Labour's Lost</b>
</h3>
<p>
  Eager to win eternal fame as scholars, the young King of Navarre and his three lords vow to study in solitude and contemplation for three years. The edict, which encompasses all of the court including the hilarious assortment of characters who inhabit its fringes, prohibits women from coming within a mile of the court. The king, however, has forgotten that the Princess of France and her three ladies are due to arrive on a diplomatic mission.<br>
  <br>
  Complications arise as the young men struggle to maintain their scholarly aspirations against the allure of love. The women, forced to camp on the outskirts of the court as they wait for a resolution to their mission, amuse themselves in making a sport out of the men's naive attempts to woo them.<br>
  <br>
  Shakespeare's wittiest comedy is a battle between the sexes fought with words and set against a background of youthful idealism and romantic yearning.
</p>
<h3>
  <b>Cymbeline</b>
</h3>
<p>
  Cymbeline is the King of Britain during the reign of Augustus Caesar in Rome. By his first marriage, he has a daughter, Imogen, as well as two sons who were stolen away at birth and are now presumed dead. Contrary to her father's wishes, Imogen has married Posthumous, a commoner. In anger, Cymbeline banishes Posthumous to Rome.<br>
  <br>
  There Posthumous meets Iachimo who, hearing Imogen praised for her chastity, wagers he can seduce her. Iachimo returns to Posthumous with false proof of Imogen's infidelity, and the devastated Posthumous writes to his servant to arrange Imogen's death. The faithful servant instead helps Imogen to escape, disguised as a boy, to Milford-Haven where she is taken in by an old man whose two sons grow strangely fond of her.<br>
  <br>
  Meanwhile, because Cymbeline has refused to pay tribute to Rome, the Roman army (including the disillusioned Posthumous) invades Britain at Milford-Haven. In the aftermath of the ensuing battle all is put right.<br>
  <br>
  Written at the height of Shakespeare's experimentation with the fairytale-like conventions of romance, <i>Cymbeline</i> is his most visionary and optimistic work. In Imogen, he has written a character whose loyalty and strength of heart guide her through devastation and betrayal to a reconciliation which confirms all that is exhilarating about our strangest dreams.
</p>
<h3>
  <b>Kean</b>
</h3>
<p>
  Jean Paul Sartre's play is based on the magnetic 19th-century actor, Edmund Kean. As the play opens, Kean is at the top of his profession. He is adored by theater audiences and secretly favored by many society ladies. He is also perilously in debt and bitterly aware that he is considered a declasse vulgarian by society.<br>
  <br>
  His tumultuous affair with the Countess Elena de Koefeld comes to a dramatic climax during a performance of <i>Othello.</i> Distraught by the sight of Elena's apparent betrayal with the Prince of Wales, Kean tears through the veil of theatrical illusion to berate the prince in Othello's words. Finding his own despair no match for Othello's grand passion, Kean grows skeptical of the authenticity of his own feeling after so skillfully pretending the emotions of others for so long.<br>
  <br>
  The play is both an exploration of the existential angst of the individual and a mordantly funny satire of the intrigues of the 19th-century Romantic drama.

<p>
  Donald Osterbrock, professor emeritus of <a href="http://www.ucolick.org/~board/index.html">astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC</a> and astronomer emeritus at UC Observatories/Lick Observatory, has been chosen to receive the University of Chicago Alumni Medal. Created in 1941 to recognize exceptional career achievements that have benefited society, the medal is the highest honor awarded to alumni of the university. The award will be presented to Osterbrock at a ceremony in June.
</p><a href="http://www.ucolick.org/~board/faculty/osterbrock.html">Osterbrock</a> earned his B.S. in physics and his M.S. and Ph.D. in astronomy from the University of Chicago, and in 1992 the university awarded him the honorary degree of Doctor of Science. (He also holds honorary doctorates from Ohio State University and the University of Wisconsin-Madison.)<br>
<br>
Osterbrock's research has made influential contributions to the body of knowledge on interstellar matter, gaseous nebulae, and the nuclei of active galaxies. His books on the subjects are standards in the field. Osterbrock also has published several books on the history of American astronomy. His most recent is <i>Yerkes Observatory, 1892-1950: The Birth, Near Death, and Resurrection of a Scientific Research Institution</i> (University of Chicago Press, 1997).<br>
<br>
Osterbrock came to UCSC in 1972 and served as director of Lick Observatory from 1973 to 1981. Before joining UCSC's faculty, he was affiliated with Princeton University, the California Institute of Technology, and the University of Wisconsin.<br>
<br>
Osterbrock is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the American Philosophical Society, and numerous professional organizations. He also is a foreign associate of the Royal Astronomical Society. The American Astronomical Society and the Astronomical Society of the Pacific have both lauded Osterbrock's career with their lifetime achievement awards, two of astronomy's highest honors. In 1997, the Royal Astronomical Society awarded Osterbrock its highest honor, the Gold Medal, in recognition of his lifetime achievement in the field of astronomy.

        <title>Growth is subject of Leadership Convocation</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  When the inaugural Leadership Convocation took place on campus in 1998, the managers and supervisors who attended discussed the growth that was on UCSC's horizon. The 200 people who attended the third annual convocation last week grappled with the challenges that the growth--already in evidence on campus--will present in the first decade of the new century. In her opening remarks, Chancellor Greenwood said UCSC will be expected to share in the responsibility of educating the so-called "Tidal Wave II" students--the children of the Baby Boom Generation--who will become eligible for college between now and 2010. Projections indicate that the University of California system, just one of three branches of higher education in the state, will need to find space for 63,000 additional students by the year 2010. Greenwood said she believes the UC system has a clear obligation to accommodate those students, adding that reducing that number would rob tomorrow's students of the same opportunities that she and the convocation attendees enjoyed. According to preliminary estimates put forth by UC's Office of the President, UCSC's share of the Tidal Wave II students will push enrollment from the 15,000 figure projected in UCSC's current <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/ppc/lrdp/">Long Range Development Plan</a> (1988-2005) to 16,900 by the year 2010. Greenwood said it may be possible to accommodate the additional 1,900 students through a variety of strategies: enrollment at the proposed <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/general_info/regional_center/">Silicon Valley Regional Center</a>, enhancement of UCSC's <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/international_programs/">Education Abroad Program</a>, and additional field-study placements. "We are not, as of this point, talking about having additional students on the campus itself," the chancellor told the managers and supervisors present for Leadership Convocation 2000, held in the Stevenson College Dining Hall on March 6. Still, UCSC will face budgetary, space, workload, and other challenges as it accommodates the additional students, reported members of UCSC's senior administration, which meets as the campus's Administrative Council. The recruitment of people--both faculty and staff--will be one of the challenges, said John Simpson, campus provost and executive vice chancellor. According to Office of the President projections, the growth in students from the current 11,000 to 16,900 will require that the campus recruit 310 faculty in the next ten years. That doesn't count the "more than 310" recruitments that will be needed to replace faculty vacancies created during that same period of time, Simpson added. In an increasingly competitive job market, UCSC will also need to recruit and retain staff to support the growth in students and faculty, said Julia Armstrong-Zwart, assistant chancellor for Human Resources. UCSC's turnover rate has been climbing in recent years, she added. "We're on a trajectory that is not a good trajectory." Simpson chairs the Administrative Council, which is comprised of Armstrong-Zwart; Francisco Hernandez, vice chancellor for Student Affairs; Meredith Michaels, associate vice chancellor for Planning and Budget; Ron Suduiko, vice chancellor for University Relations; Leslie Sunell, assistant chancellor; and Tom Vani, vice chancellor for Business and Administrative Services (BAS). Simpson, who led a question-and-answer session between members of the council and the convocation participants, suggested that the transition from a campus of 11,000 students to one with an enrollment of 16,900 will require a transformation in the campus's mode of operation. As the campus grows, for example, more decision-making must take place at the unit or individual level, he said. Simpson also challenged attendees to become less fearful of "risk-taking," collaborate when possible, and "tilt the balance" from problem identification toward problem resolution. Two new members of the council, Suduiko and Michaels, were attending their first convocation, and both delivered informative presentations related to their respective divisions. Suduiko described the workings of University Relations and outlined the division's fund-raising goals; Michaels detailed the complex process by which UC's budget is determined. An interactive performance, which concluded the convocation, turned the spotlight on many of the growth-related challenges that UCSC has already begun to confront. The performance--"Act on It," by Orlando-Ward & Associates--provided humorous but relevant insights into the organizational failings of a make-believe hi-tech company experiencing rapid expansion. The planning committee for this year's Leadership Convocation was chaired by Catherine Faris of BAS. Also serving on the committee were Sharon Cohen Barry, Staff Human Resources (SHR); Sheila Gottehrer, Ombudsman; Kiyomi Inouye, Office of the Chancellor; Gail Heit, Student Affairs; Kathy Jefferds, Natural Sciences; Jo Ann McFarland, Economics; Peter McMillan, BAS; Willeen McQuitta, SHR; Linda Rhoads, Planning and Budget; Jean Marie Scott, Porter College; and Beau Willis, Office of the Provost.

        <title>Undergraduate research poster earns honorable mention at national science meeting</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 13 Mar 2000 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>8663</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  UCSC undergraduate Maria Catalina earned an honorable mention in the student poster competition at the national meeting of the <a href="http://www.aaas.org">American Association for the Advancement of Science</a> (AAAS), held in Washington, D.C., in February.<br>
  <br>
  The poster competition included both undergraduate and graduate students who presented the results of independent research projects. Catalina's project examined chemical reaction pathways that may have been involved in the origin of life. Her poster, titled "Proposed in-situ hydrothermal condensation reactions of biological molecules with catalytic metal sulfides and montmorillonite," describes reactions occurring under conditions found in geothermally active areas.<br>
  <br>
  The chemical and hydrothermal properties of geothermally active areas, such as hot springs and ocean vents, have led some scientists to propose such sites as models for the conditions under which life may have evolved on Earth.<br>
  <br>
  Catalina is an independent major and plans to graduate in June with a B.A. in Bionomy. ("Bionomy" is an archaic term meaning "the study of life processes.") She has been accepted into the graduate program in geosciences at the University of Colorado at Boulder.<br>
  <br>
  A re-entry student and mother of three boys, Catalina has pursued several interdisciplinary research projects as an undergraduate. Her mentors include professor of earth sciences Elise Knittle, professor emeritus of chemistry and biochemistry David Deamer, professor emeritus of astronomy and astrophysics Frank Drake, and professor of anthropology Triloki Pandey. She has also worked with researchers at other institutions, including NASA Ames Research Center and Scripps Institution of Oceanography.<br>
  <br>
  One of the inspirations for Catalina's research was her interest in a clay mineral (montmorillonite) used for therapeutic purposes by Native Americans in the Southwest. The clay is also used in the creation ceremony of the Mescalero Apache, Catalina's maternal ancestors, and she was intrigued to learn that some scientists have suggested the clay may have played an important role in the origins of key biological molecules.<br>
  <br>
  Her investigations opened up many interesting opportunities, such as an expedition to Yellowstone National Park with NASA scientist Sherry Cady to collect microorganisms from hot springs.<br>
  <br>
  "I feel fortunate to have participated in such a variety of research projects just by following the thread of my first question about the biochemical basis for the therapeutic properties of montmorillonite," Catalina said.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_8661" align="alignright" width="135"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/03/atkinson_ric.00-03-13.135.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-8661" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/03/atkinson_ric.00-03-13.135.jpg" alt="President Richard C. Atkinson" width="135" height="182" /></a>President Richard C. Atkinson[/caption]
<p>
  Some 700,000 additional students will enroll at California's colleges and universities in the next decade, placing enormous demands on the institutions that have helped fuel the state's recent prosperity, University of California President Richard C. Atkinson said on March 8.
</p>"The California of the next decade simply will not work if these students don't have the education they need to go wherever their talents and opportunities lead them," Atkinson said in remarks prepared for delivery to the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco.<br>
<br>
Atkinson said that California's booming "new economy" owes much of its success to the innovations that flow from research universities, and those institutions will continue to occupy center stage in the years to come.<br>
<br>
"The California of the 21st century is headed for change. It's going to be bigger, more diverse, and more dependent on the creation of knowledge to keep its economy productive. The University of California is critical to our society's ability to ensure that the forces of demographics, intellectual discovery, and economic productivity work in its favor and not against it," he said.<br>
<br>
Student enrollment is growing as California's diverse population and prosperous economy grow.<br>
<br>
In the 1950s and 1960s, an original "Tidal Wave" of students hit California as the baby-boom generation entered the state's colleges and universities. "Tidal Wave II" is emerging as the children of those baby boomers are expected to attend California's university and college campuses within the next decade.<br>
<br>
By 2010, the University of California's general-campus enrollment will grow approximately 40 percent to 210,000 students, matching UC's total enrollment growth over the past 30 years. At the same time, the university must also hire 3,000 additional faculty.<br>
<br>
To accommodate its share of the coming surge of students and to ensure a diverse student body, Atkinson outlined a number of strategies, including:
<ul>
  <li>The opening of UC Merced, the system's tenth campus.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Regular-session growth at established campuses.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Expanded summer sessions.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Expanded UC programs using off-campus centers, Education Abroad, and distance learning.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Initiatives to improve K-12 education and encourage outstanding teaching, such as the Reading and Algebra Institutes, the Principal Leadership Institutes, and Subject Matters Projects, which Atkinson views as the "guarantee of long-term progress" in increasing diversity on UC campuses.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Turning his attention to the role of intellectual discovery and its implications for economic growth, Atkinson noted that UC's research in agriculture, biomedical technologies, computer and information sciences, and other fields has played a major role in California's current record prosperity.<br>
  <br>
  "We have made a deliberate effort at UC to improve technology transfer and work more closely with industry to transform basic research into useful products," Atkinson said.<br>
  <br>
  As a measure of technology transfer, UC generates more patents than any other U.S. university. Furthermore, UC's Industry-University Cooperative Research program has invested more than $100 million in the past three years for new research, including the BioSTAR project and the Digital Media Innovation Program, which will keep California at the forefront of the highly competitive biotechnology and multimedia industries. These efforts will be complemented by the governor's proposed Institutes for Science and Innovation and support for expanded science and engineering enrollments in the coming decade.<br>
  <br>
  "These research partnerships are an appropriate and productive extension of our land-grant mission," Atkinson said. "At the same time, the University of California offers one of the best educations, undergraduate and graduate, available anywhere.<br>
  <br>
  "California is entering the new century with a booming economy. This gives us a tremendous strategic advantage in dealing with the powerful demographic and economic forces ahead of us," Atkinson concluded. "We have the opportunity to make the next decade one of the most productive ever, not just for higher education but for California."

<p>
  <font color="#000000">A public hearing on the Draft EIR on the relocation of the modular student housing complex (the Village) will be held on Friday, March 10, from 6 to 8 p.m. at the Barn Theater. The proposed project would relocate 17 modular housing units and 2 support units from the north campus--where Colleges Nine and Ten residence halls will be built--to the Lower Quarry. The relocated modular housing units would provide bed spaces for approximately 153 students. The project also includes the installation of an additional modular support unit, the construction of a storage shed, and the relocation of the modular Agroecology Office/lab complex from the northern part of the Lower Quarry to the southern part of the Lower Quarry.<br>
  <br>
  At the public hearing, campus planners will provide a description of the project and its environmental effects, and members of the public will be invited to give oral comments on the Draft EIR for the project.

<p>
  Two UCSC undergraduate students have earned $500 prizes plus paid internships from Salz Leathers of Santa Cruz by proposing original ideas for reuse of leather shavings.
</p>The 20,000 pounds of leather shavings produced each week by the tannery as a by-product of the manufacturing process are currently hauled off for disposal at the Santa Cruz Landfill. As part of the company's ongoing efforts to find alternative uses for the shavings, Salz sought proposals from UCSC undergraduates last fall.<br>
<br>
"We wanted to tap into the bright minds of UCSC students to see if they could come up with some innovative ideas," said Ward Alksne, environmental manager at Salz Leathers.<br>
<br>
The proposals were evaluated by Alksne, Russell Flegal, professor of environmental toxicology, and Ravi Rajan, assistant professor of environmental studies.<br>
<br>
The two winners were John Murphy, a junior majoring in earth sciences, and Regan Smith, a senior in environmental studies. They each received a $500 award in a ceremony on Friday, February 25. The students were also offered paid internships at Salz Leathers to further develop their proposals under Alksne's direction.<br>
<br>
The leather shavings, generated in the process of trimming leather to the desired thickness, are mostly protein plus a small amount of chromium, a tanning agent. Murphy proposed using the shavings to create a fiberglass-like product, substituting the shavings for the fibers ordinarily used to make fiberglass. He performed some preliminary experiments using different types of resins and different mixtures of resin and shavings.<br>
<br>
Smith's proposal put forth several ideas for alternative use of the shavings, ranging from building insulation to organic fertilizer. Alksne said he was pleased to receive one proposal that was broad in scope and showed considerable flexibility and another that was more specific.<br>
<br>
"The internships will offer the students an opportunity to get some real-world experience in pursuing their ideas," he said.<br>
<br>
Salz Leathers, located on River Street by the San Lorenzo River, is one of the few family-owned tanneries remaining in the United States. The original products of the tannery were saddles and harnesses for horses and oxen. Today they make premium natural leather for shoes, boots, handbags, and other products. The company produces about 300,000 square feet of leather per week for customers around the world.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>
  <font color="#000000"><b>Unlearning Hatred on the Playground: Lessons from Michigan and Colorado</b></font>
</h2>

<p>
  <b><br></b> A six-year-old boy does the unthinkable, and within hours, we learn of the depraved conditions in which he lived: He came from a dysfunctional family with a drug-addicted mother and a father in jail. At the time of the shooting, he was living with his uncle in a rundown shack suspected of being a crack house.
</p>

<p>
  Again, we're reminded of how strongly our surroundings affect us all. And again, we're hearing the chorus of calls for gun control and the installation of metal detectors in schools.
</p>

<p>
  Although the circumstances were very different, beginning with the age of the Michigan boy, the tragedy reminds us of Columbine, West Paducah, and Conyers. We as parents and grandparents understandably crave actions that will fix whatever is dangerously broken in our schools. We want to fix it--and fix it fast.
</p>

<p>
  Why is it that we can so clearly see the importance of the context of the young Michigan boy's life, yet we're reluctant to look at the underlying atmosphere of the schools in which the other shootings occurred?
</p>

<p>
  Tighter gun control laws are fine. In some schools, metal detectors may be useful. But let's also be sure to focus attention on the undercurrent of anger, bullying, and taunting that is prevalent in most American schools. Let's not rush in with half-baked interventions, like posting the Ten Commandments in classrooms, when richer options are readily available.
</p>

<p>
  Social psychologists have compiled an impressive library of data over the past 40 years that tells a lot about why humans behave the way we do. Our work is concerned with important aspects of human social behavior, including persuasion, conformity, love, hate, aggression, and prejudice. For years, those with a financial incentive, like politicians and advertisers, have been able to ferret out useful findings that help them get elected and sell cigarettes, but we as scientists have done a poor job of getting the news out to the general public. Unlike medical research, social psychological findings rarely make it onto the evening news.
</p>

<p>
  But there is an upside to this story. While the media have been paying attention to other things, social psychologists have spent years conducting careful research that has the power to change what is wrong in our schools.
</p>

<p>
  Years of classroom research reveals that the social atmosphere in most schools is competitive, cliquish, and exclusionary. Most schools are places where students are shunned if they are in the "wrong" group, if they come from the "wrong" side of the tracks, wear the "wrong" kind of clothes, are too short or too fat, too tall or too thin, or are the "wrong" race or ethnicity. In short, the general school atmosphere is one of exclusion that many, if not most,of the students find unpleasant, distasteful, difficult, and even humiliating.
</p>

<p>
  Clearly, the tragedies that unfolded in Littleton, West Paducah, and Springfield were pathological, violent acts. The perpetrators of these horrifying deeds were disturbed. But if we chalk up these events simply to individual pathology, we are missing something of vital importance. These perpetrators were reacting in an extreme and pathological manner to a general school atmosphere that breeds an environment of exclusion, mockery, and taunting.
</p>

<p>
  If we can change the social atmosphere of the classroom, we might succeed both in making schools safer places and also in producing the kind of social environment that will make schools a more pleasant, stimulating, compassionate, humane place for all students. By creating an atmosphere in which there are no "losers," we can help students learn important human values as they learn arithmetic, reading, and science.
</p>

<p>
  Easier said than done, you say? Not necessarily. For the past 30 years, social psychologists have been conducting scientific experiments in classrooms at hundreds of schools all over America on a cooperative learning structure called "the jigsaw classroom." This strategy, used primarily in grade school classrooms but also applicable at the high school level, involves structuring the learning environment in a way that requires students to pay attention to one another, to cooperate with one another, and to share their knowledge with one another.
</p>

<p>
  In the process, students are motivated to listen respectfully to one another, to help one another, and to begin to care about one another. Students who have been prejudiced against each other because of racial or ethnic differences--or simply because they looked or acted differently--have actually become close friends.
</p>

<p>
  Best of all, they learn all this while in the process of learning history, geography, biology, and all the traditional academic subjects as well as or better than they would in more traditional classrooms. The strategy doesn't require any new curricular material; it simply involves teaching traditional material in a nontraditional structure where children pull together rather than compete against one another.
</p>

<p>
  By working closely with one another in a cooperative way, students begin to see positive qualities in their classmates that they hadn't seen before. Within a few weeks, artificial barriers of exclusion begin to recede, and a general atmosphere of compassion and respect eventually prevails.
</p>

<p>
  Unfortunately, it often takes a tragedy to arouse the public's interest in changing the atmosphere in our schools and to motivate social psychologists to make our research more accessible to people who can use it. Knowledge is power, and parents, teachers, and ordinary citizens need to know that there are proven, effective classroom interventions that can reduce their feelings of helplessness and empower them to take action to make their children's school safer and more humane.
</p>

<p>
  If we cannot succeed in teaching our children to be more compassionate, more caring, more empathic toward one another, gun control and metal detectors will never make them safe. The beauty is that the tools for teaching compassion exist. The tragedy is that they are not being utilized.<br>
  <br>

  <br>
  Cosmologist <b>Joel Primack,</b> professor of physics, was featured prominently in an article in the <i>New York Times</i> about the nature of the so-called "dark matter" in the universe. Primack spoke on the subject at a recent cosmology conference in Marina Del Rey.
</p>

<p>
  The <b>University Library</b> collection of slides by Branson DeCou was featured recently in <i>College and Research Libraries News,</i> which put one of the stunning images on its January cover.
</p>

<p>
  As the mud started to fly in the local district attorney's race, psychology's <b>Anthony Pratkanis</b> waded through the accusations for the <i>Santa Cruz County Sentinel.</i>. . . . Also gracing the <i>Sentinel's</i> pages was <b>John Dizikes</b> of American studies, who spoke with columnist Kathy Krieger in advance of his downtown lecture about the history of the campus.
</p>

<p>
  Columnist Judie Marks of the <i>Monterey County Herald</i> praised the new Seymour Center at Long Marine Lab in a recent column. She wrote that the only problem with the center is "it might inspire too many people to study marine science." Mentioned in the story were center director <b>Julie Barrett Heffington</b> and researchers <b>Burney Le Boeuf, John Pearse, Mary Silver, James Estes, Don Croll,</b> and <b>Peggy Delaney.</b><br>
  <br>
  <b>Judy Yung</b> of American studies was the subject of a lengthy feature in the <i>Santa Cruz County Sentinel,</i> which covered the story of her latest book, <i>Unbound Voices.<br>
  <br></i>Harpsichordist <b>Linda Burman-Hall</b> was described in a <i>Metro Santa Cruz</i> story as a "plucky programmer" because of her role as music director of the annual Santa Cruz Baroque Festival. With the festival around the corner, the local weekly wrote up a story on the history of the festival, the current season, and Burman-Hall herself.<br>

<p>
  <i>This is the second article in an occasional series following the progress of two members of the UCSC campus community as they pursue their physical fitness goals.</i> Making progress is one of the most rewarding benefits of sticking to a new fitness program, and career adviser Katrina Cope can already feel the difference that working out has made in her life.
</p>"I'm getting into it," said Cope, who started her new regimen in January and now finds herself watching fitness shows on television. Twice a week, Cope attends a lunch-hour "Express Workout" at the new Wellness Center, and she is steadily adding weight to her routine. "I started out with only one weight on the upper-body machines, and now I'm up to two and three, depending on which muscles the machine exercises," said Cope. "I'm not trying to build muscle mass as much as to get toned."<br>
<br>
Motivation is less of a problem since she became the "office poster child," joked Cope, who had predicted that campus publicity would keep her on track. "I sent a copy of the article to my sister, who's a gymnastics coach," said Cope. "She thought it was great. It's nice because she's always been the 'fit' sister, and now she's encouraging me."<br>
<br>
Last week, Cope was ready to up the ante by undergoing a thorough fitness evaluation by Wellness Center manager Ryan Andrews. The session assessed Cope's cardiovascular fitness, strength, flexibility, and body composition--otherwise known as the dreaded body-fat analysis. The session, which took about an hour, is similar to those Andrews hopes to be offering for a moderate fee to all campus members by spring quarter.<br>
<br>
Cope's overall results were very good, said Andrews. Her resting heart rate is 70 beats per minute, her blood pressure was "textbook" at 116/76. At 30.8 percent, her fat level is just within the average range of 23 to 31 percent for her age and sex, but he said he'd like to see it drop to 25 percent or below.<br>
<br>
A quick calculation revealed that Cope's training heart rate is between 106 and 145 beats per minute. "Working out at 65 to 85 percent of your maximum heart rate burns the most efficient blend of carbohydrates and fats," explained Andrews, who offered Cope tips on taking her pulse quickly but added that the "talk test" is a pretty reliable indicator, too.<br>
<br>
"You want to be able to talk while you're working out, but if you're able to sing, you're not working hard enough," he said with a smile.<br>
<br>
For Cope, losing weight is secondary to her goals of losing inches and toning up. For those who are interested in slimming down, Andrews said increasing muscle mass is the most effective way to change body composition.<br>
<br>
"Muscle uses more calories even when you're at rest, so that's the most efficient way to shed fat," said Andrews.<br>
<br>
Cope's cardiovascular fitness was also good, as indicated by the results of a treadmill test that assessed maximum oxygen consumption. "You probably won't see a lot of improvement in that area unless you increase the intensity of your aerobic activity," Andrews told Cope.<br>
<br>
The results of Cope's strength tests were "pretty good, too. Much better than I expected," said Andrews.<br>
<br>
"You're doing great," he told Cope. "You're going to have to work hard to see a big change in six months."<br>
<br>
Cope's weakest results were in flexibility, where she landed in the "fair to below average" range.<br>
<br>
The results enabled Andrews to give Cope some workout advice, suggesting that she add stretching and some aerobic exercise to her routine. He also urged her to push herself a little bit during the lunch-hour walks she takes on her "off days," suggesting that she trim a minute or two off the 45-minute walk while still covering the same distance.<br>
<br>
"This gives us good numbers to compare to in June," said Andrews.<br>
<br>
<hr>
<p>
  <b>Fitness tips:</b> To calculate your own training heart rate, subtract your age from 220; your target should be 60 to 85 percent of that number. For example, if you are 40 years old, your target would be 60 to 85 percent of 180, or 108 to 153 beats per minute. During a workout, Andrews suggests taking your pulse for six seconds and multiplying the result by ten.<br>

  For most of us, high school had its undeniably traumatic times. If it wasn't a giant pimple on prom night, someone was spraying Cheez Whiz into your locker, or the assistant principal could run faster than you. But those experiences pale in comparison to the troubles faced by poor Buffy. During her high school career, Buffy lost one principal to a rampaging pack of teenagers possessed by hyena spirits. Then she had to fend off a 500-year-old Incan mummy who wanted to suck out her soul with a deadly kiss. And her heartache is still fresh from her ill-fated romance with Angel, a vampire with good intentions but a nasty bite.
</p>This season Buffy, the main character in WB Network's hit show, "<a href="http://www.buffyslayer.com">Buffy the Vampire Slayer</a>," grew up and went to college. And local viewers began noticing some strangely familiar names: Buffy's college is UC Sunnydale and various scenes have taken place in dorms with the names Stevenson, Kresge, and Porter.<br>
<br>
The person behind those local references is writer Marti Noxon, the show's supervising producer and a UCSC alumna (Oakes '87). Noxon, who majored in theater arts with an emphasis in film, came back to campus last week to speak about her career. Noxon drew a substantial crowd of students, staff, faculty, and <i>Buffy</i> fans who reportedly traveled from as far away as San Francisco and San Jose to attend the lecture.<br>
<br>
Along with screening an episode of the show, Noxon reminisced about her days on campus. "When I went to film school here, we were using Super-8 cameras that we mounted on shopping carts," she recalled. But things have changed since Noxon's day--[http://arts.ucsc.edu/filmvideo/index.html] the program, which used to operate as a part of theater arts, is now an autonomous department. The program also changed its name recently from "film and video" to "film and digital media" (reflecting changes in the technology) and now boasts state-of-the-art equipment and facilities and a talented and greatly expanded faculty.<br>
<br>
Like most UCSC film students, Noxon learned both production and theory. And, although film and digital media professor Eli Hollander remembers Noxon's student film as one of the best of her class, Noxon says that, as a writer, the study of film theory was what really made a difference to her when she began writing and selling scripts. "That orientation gave me the perspective to understand the show and get the job. It helped me grasp Buffy's character and to understand the metaphorical context of her experiences with these demons."<br>
<br>
After ten years in the business, Noxon had heartfelt advice for her audience: "If you get discouraged easily, a career in film and television is not for you. I know a lot of genius writers who could blow me off the screen, but they don't have the doggedness to hang in there. Look how long it's taken me. A lot of writers my age are just getting their break after ten years of trying."<br>
<br>
After Noxon graduated from UCSC, she began writing in earnest and tried to sell a screenplay she'd written in college. It was what Noxon describes as a "comedy about a mean-spirited family." It wasn't well received at the time but a few years later, after <i>The Simpsons</i> came out, Noxon said the work received a lot of positive feedback.<br>
<br>
Eventually she sold a freelance script for the show <i>Life Goes On</i> And after that she didn't sell anything more for seven years. During that time she worked in two different jobs as a director's assistant. The work wasn't exactly glamorous--Noxon did everything from getting coffee to picking up her boss's children. "In Hollywood, assistants do everything for our bosses," she said. But, she added, there is general recognition in the business that people take assistant jobs as a way of getting a foot in the door and a supportive boss is willing to read scripts and help their assistants (at least the talented ones) to get agents.<br>
<br>
When Noxon was offered the job as a writer for <i>Buffy</i> in 1996, she turned it down. She'd simultaneously received an offer for a similar position with the show, <i>The Pretender.</i> And the premise of melding a high school drama with a horror show seemed a little, well, iffy. "Fortunately," she said, "the creator (executive producer Joss Whedon) called and told me 'You need to take this job. I'll make you a better writer.'"<br>
<br>
Four years later the show is the second most popular on the WB Network and was Yahoo!'s award winner for 1999 for the television show most talked about online. Noxon has moved from the lowest writer on the rung to supervising producer, making her second in command in the show's writing hierarchy. This means that she has input not only on the scripts but, to a degree, on film editing and directing. Also, no one edits her scripts except Whedon. "I can't tell you how many times people tell me they love a particular line in the show and I have to say, 'Oh, thanks. Joss (Whedon) added that,'" she said with mock chagrin. Humor, she admits, is not her forte. "Melodrama is my specialty."<br>
<br>
The work of writing a show is intensive. At the beginning of the season Whedon tells the writing staff of six the general direction of the show for the year and then the group plots out the details episode by episode. Plotting out each episode can take as little as a few days but, more typically, takes about two weeks. Then the writer who is assigned to actually put the words down has roughly a week to write the 50-to 60-page script. Noxon says that the lag time between the writing of the script and the time it airs is about six weeks.<br>
<br>
Noxon's "doggedness" has paid off in many ways. She's finally getting paid to do what she loves to do--write. And, along with her work on <i>Buffy,</i> she has been contracted to write a screenplay for Universal. "It's a romantic comedy with monsters in it," she revealed and then added with a laugh, "what a surprise."<br>
<br>
Noxon told her audience that she recently took another look at the movie she'd made at UCSC. Although she wasn't overwhelmed by her artistic vision, seeing it reminded her of the feeling that has kept her going through the challenging times in her career. "The process of going from conceiving something to writing it to actually seeing it is wonderful. It's very exciting to see an idea go all the way from your imagination to the screen."

        <title>How to improve working conditions tops discussion at latest staff forum</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  Top campus administrators are exploring ways to improve working conditions for UCSC employees, and pressure from the booming local economy is helping drive the effort, Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood told several hundred staff members during last week's brown-bag forum. Recognizing that applicant pools are down and employment options are growing as Santa Cruz's high-tech community grows, Greenwood said she and others are committed to offering a satisfying and rewarding work environment. "The rapidly changing economy has really hit Santa Cruz, as well as Silicon Valley," said Greenwood, who fielded questions for 45 minutes from the audience of about 400 UCSC employees in Kresge Town Hall. "There are a ton of new small start-up companies in town, and some probably do pay better than we do, but I would be very surprised if their compensation packages are better than ours, except perhaps for higher level technical employees." The local "raging economy" is largely a product of higher education's contributions to the high-tech and biomedical fields, she noted. The success of those industries has created some tough competition for the university as an employer, acknowledged Greenwood. The areas UCSC administrators are exploring include compensation, benefits, and affordable housing for employees. "It's not just salaries," said Greenwood. "There are various things that could be done that might make our environment more attractive." Kim Tyler, manager of the Computer Science Department and a longtime UCSC employee, said her research revealed that UCSC is at the bottom of the salary scale for UC campuses in northern California, yet Santa Cruz is among the most expensive places to live in the country. Greenwood responded that administrators are "looking at salary rates at other northern California campuses." Julia Armstrong-Zwart, assistant chancellor of Human Resources, said the campus is working with the UC Office of the President to address these issues, "particularly at the clerical/administrative assistant level." But even if salary ranges are expanded, for example, the campus would have to reallocate money to fund increased salaries, and any change to the salary structure would have to be negotiated for represented employees, she said. Some evidence suggests that staff are leaving to pursue other employment opportunities. Human Resources reports that the turnover rate on campus has increased to 11.9 percent today from 8 percent in 1996. By comparison, Greenwood cited a recent news report that turnover in Silicon Valley is 23 percent. Staff workloads have increased in the wake of what Greenwood called "the really, really depressing period of the university's budget" in the early 1990s, and the work has also increased in complexity, said Armstrong-Zwart. As a result, requests to Staff Human Resources for reclassifications have increased to the point where office staffers are having trouble completing reviews in a timely manner. Efforts are under way to simplify and streamline the process to increase the unit's capacity, she said. Last year, 25 percent of UCSC employees were reclassed, received equity increases, or were promoted, said Armstrong-Zwart. However, Mary Harrington, network coordinator for Communications and Technology Services and a representative of the Coalition of University Employees, responded that only 5 percent of clerical staff were reclassified last year. Acknowledging tension over the numbers, Greenwood said administrators are "digging through the data," and she underscored her commitment to promote UCSC employees. "It is definitely in our interest to grow our own," she said. As the campus braces to boost student enrollment by nearly 50 percent in coming years, administrators are also trying to anticipate staffing needs, said John Simpson, campus provost and executive vice chancellor. "This year, as deans, their staff, and faculty prepared their budget initiatives, we asked the deans and vice chancellors to consider the staffing requirements associated with their proposals," said Simpson. One example of a nonsalary enhancement was suggested by Donna Baldini, administrative assistant in psychology, who asked if staff could be given access to the campus's fitness facilities without charge. Greenwood was interested in the idea. Armstrong-Zwart, in conjunction with the Faculty Welfare Committee of the Academic Senate, will propose the creation of a committee to advise Greenwood on work/life issues, and the first step would be an employee survey. "We have a lot of anecdotal information, but, based on data from a survey, the committee could recommend activities, proposals, and actions that could be taken to improve the working environment on campus," said Armstrong-Zwart. In addition, although Greenwood reiterated her inability to meet with union representatives during contract negotiations, she expressed a desire to meet informally with union representatives outside of negotiations, as well as nonrepresented employees, to hear their suggestions on subjects such as training, work/life issues, academic planning, and construction. "I'd like to systematically attack those issues . . . and see if we can't make some progress during the next few years," she said. As it has at two previous forums with staff, the cost of parking on campus emerged as a topic of widespread concern. Speakers noted that parking fees amount to more than 2 percent of some employees' annual salaries and that employees whose offices have moved off campus to the Wrigley and Dascom Buildings have received what amounts to a raise of up to $500 a year because they no longer have to pay to park. Tom Vani, vice chancellor of Business and Administrative Services, reminded the audience that by state law and UC policy, parking has to be paid for by user fees. For years, he noted, UCSC had the lowest parking rates in the UC system. "I know it doesn't sound as fair as it should be, but we're still in the bottom half of what UC workers pay for parking," said Vani. Weighing in on the issue, Greenwood said: "We have a very difficult choice right now. We can choose not to increase parking and further restrict the availability of certain permits, or we can go ahead with the parking and building plan that should've started seven or eight years ago." Acknowledging the steep increase in parking costs, Greenwood reiterated the campus's desire to support alternatives, including park-and-ride lots; bike trailers for campus shuttles, which will be available in April; and alternative transportation such as e-bikes. "For employees with fairly regular hours, there are a number of options other than buying an 'A' permit," she said. Other topics discussed during the forum included the status of postdoctoral researchers on campus, communication between campus units and labor relations representatives, the campuswide implementation of annual performance reviews, and construction of a recycled water system for irrigation. Greenwood has announced her intention to hold another staff forum during spring quarter.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_8646" align="alignright" width="200"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/03/artsbr.00-03-06.200.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-8646" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/03/artsbr.00-03-06.200.jpg" alt="Seventh-grader Jenna Escobar gets tips on a bookmaking project from Jessica Fisher.

<p>
  It's quite common these days for UCSC senior Jessica Fisher to take a walk downtown and be hailed enthusiastically by a group of excited preteens. It's not that she resembles Britney Spears or anything like that. Rather, Fisher teaches art in a local junior high every week, which has given her a small fan club of her own.
</p>Fisher teaches art to two classes of seventh graders each week through ArtsBridge, a program created to increase arts enrichment in California's secondary schools. The program began at UC Irvine during the 1998-97 school year and was so successful that it was adopted systemwide last year and now merits a $1.5 million line item in the state budget, of which UCSC receives $110,000.<br>
<br>
UCSC launched its program this past fall, sending 21 students into area schools to teach classes in the arts. This winter quarter, 58 UCSC students are in classrooms in four counties--Santa Cruz, Santa Clara, Monterey, and San Benito--teaching art, music, drama, dance, and digital art and film. In all, they reach more than 1,700 secondary school students each week. The UCSC students are a part of cadre of some 600 UC students teaching through ArtsBridge across the state.<br>
<br>
As its name indicates, the program was conceived as a bridge between two communities with common interests and symbiotic needs. "ArtsBridge is a wonderful way for UCSC students to cement what they have learned at the university by breaking it down and adapting it to the needs of individual classrooms," explains Porter College provost and professor of theater arts Kathy Foley, who is the director of UCSC's ArtsBridge program. "At the same time, the program aims to be of service to the larger community and to bring the joy of learning and creativity into every classroom."<br>
<br>
During a recent Friday-morning class, Fisher walked among her seventh-grade students at Mission Hill Junior High School in Santa Cruz, advising them as they struggled with the concept of perspective. "Sometimes they get really frustrated," Fisher says, "Perspective was especially hard and a lot of kids were asking, 'Do we have to do this?' But, after about a half hour, it was really coming together and their pictures were looking like the object they were drawing. And then the kids, four of them at almost the same time, just let out these excited, 'Oh!'s. They got it!"<br>
<br>
Fisher works closely with her classroom teacher, Diane Smith, whom she describes as "incredible." Smith has helped Fisher learn both classroom management and ways to structure lessons so that they are effective for the kids. In addition to mentorship from classroom teachers like Smith, UCSC students work with a faculty mentor. At UCSC, the mentors are Foley, art professor Norman Locks, music professor Linda Burman-Hall, film and digital media professor Eli Hollander, Sesnon Art Gallery curator Shelby Graham, and ArtsBridge program coordinator Stephanie Settle.<br>
<br>
Mentors meet one-on-one with the students and observe them in the classroom. There is no academic credit given for participation and yet Settle says that students are eager to participate. Students do receive a $1,000 stipend for their work, which, Norman Locks points out, is extremely valuable. "They're working very hard, but they are getting paid to do work in their field as opposed to having to work downtown for minimum wage."<br>
<br>
Locks says the hands-on experience is invaluable to arts students, many of whom consider careers in teaching as a viable way of continuing in their field. "In our academic environment, in many cases, we don't concentrate on the applied aspects of learning. Many students express interest in going into education after graduation, but if you don't give them the experience, how can they know?"<br>
<br>
"I've been thinking about teaching since I was about ten ," Fisher says. "When I found out about ArtsBridge it seemed like a good way for me to find out if I wanted to invest more time and money into getting a degree and getting into the classroom. Without some experience, going for a teaching credential seemed like a big risk--what if I wound up not enjoying it or not being good at it?"<br>
<br>
"As much as the program serves UC students, it is also considered as arts enrichment for the schools," Settle says. "We are looking to the future, with the hope that we can help make up the gap in arts education. We hope this program can help generate a thriving arts community of practitioners, teachers, and audiences."<br>
<br>
In the year 2003, UC will require all entering freshmen to have completed one year of art during high school. But right now, Locks says, "The likelihood of students coming to our program from the California school system with sufficient training in the arts is not very good. Generally, we have to start from scratch. So, from that point of view, ArtsBridge is one more way that we can give students in the secondary school system some training so that they don't have to start at the beginning when they get here."<br>
<br>
When the sixth-grade students of ArtsBridge teacher Ali El-Gasseir get to college, they will be way ahead of the game in many respects. El-Gasseir already has them reading the work of novelist Italo Calvino, and Shakespeare is next. El-Gasseir has a simple bottom line in his class: "I would like my students to know that there are other things out there aside from television and movies," he says.<br>
<br>
El-Gasseir is a senior theater arts major, who has been teaching drama at Gambetta Junior High School in Castroville for the past two quarters. He says that his students really warm up to even the more challenging authors when they get to learn the works through dramatic play.<br>
<br>
He marvels at the way in which engaging in dramatic play facilitates learning for his students, many of whom speak English as a second language. "Some kids have a hard time spelling and struggle with reading. But theater is a way that they can learn vocabulary extremely quickly. For instance, we had a class in which we talked about the idea of actors and audience and no one in class could spell 'audience.' But by the end of the day, not only could they spell it, they were comfortable using terms like 'dramatic irony.' "<br>
<br>
El-Gasseir speaks about his experience with great enthusiasm--he has gained a lot personally and he has been gratified to see that his students have gained something too. "I really enjoy teaching. This experience will definitely help me on my resume and it's fun to come in on Wednesdays and know that they're looking forward to class. There were those days when no one raised their hands or paid attention, but now they actually want to get up and perform. It feels good to think they'll come away with something. If they like Calvino or Shakespeare and read them for the rest of their lives, that's great."

        <title>Study suggests sewage in urban runoff may spur growth of harmful algal blooms</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  Researchers at UC Sant Cruz and San Francisco State University have found that urea from urban waste, generally ignored as a pollutant by environmental agencies, contributes to growth of potentially toxic blooms of a common type of marine algae. Assistant professor of ocean sciences Raphael Kudela and his coworker, William Cochlan of SFSU's Romberg Tiburon Center for Environmental Studies, studied a major bloom of single-celled organisms called dinoflagellates, which grow into potentially toxic blankets of algae commonly known as red tides when excess nutrients cross their paths. The researchers found that the dinoflagellates prefer urea, an organic nitrogen compound found in urine and in agricultural and urban runoff, over inorganic nitrogen sources such as ammonium and nitrate that occur naturally in the ocean. The new findings, published in the current issue of <i>Aquatic Microbial Ecology,</i> suggest that urea in urban and agricultural runoff may play a greater role than previously thought in triggering or sustaining harmful algal blooms found growing off California's coastline. "The particular bloom we looked at, which extended from the upper Baja peninsula in Mexico to the Monterey Bay, occurred after heavy urban runoff events in the southern California region," Kudela said. "Our data suggests it was probably triggered by the increased concentration of urea introduced to the ocean by urban runoff." Kudela and Cochlan examined the physiology and ecology of the bloom, which occurred in 1995 and was the largest and most widespread red tide found off California's coast since 1902. Though marine scientists usually monitor marine ecosystems for high concentrations of common inorganic nutrients known to spur harmful algal blooms, urea is generally ignored, the researchers said. Previous studies have shown that urea can nourish the growth of dinoflagellates under laboratory conditions. The new study shows for the first time, however, that the naturally occurring red-tide dinoflagellate responsible for the 1995 bloom--known scientifically as <i>Lingulodinium polyedrum</i>--can use organic urea as a nutrient source and even prefers it over traditionally measured inorganic forms of nitrogen. "Although urea as a source of pollution is generally ignored by state and federal environmental agencies, research shows that urea represents an average of one-third of the total nitrogen uptake supporting growth of phytoplankton in regions where red tides can occur," Cochlan said. "In some estuarine areas, such as the Chesapeake Bay, urea can represent 60 percent of the nitrogen uptake at certain times of the year." Phytoplankton serve as the base of the marine food web, but unusually high levels of nutrients together with abundant sunlight can spur rapid growth, or blooms, of these single-celled plants, leading to dense patches of algae floating near the surface of the ocean that can double in size daily. While most blooms are not harmful, a small number of phytoplankton species can produce potent neurotoxins when they form into a bloom, sometimes poisoning or killing higher life forms such as zooplankton, shellfish, fish, birds, marine mammals, and even humans as the toxin is transferred up the food chain. Although <i>Lingulodinium polyedrum</i> has been reported to produce yessotoxin, a compound related to the class of poisons that cause paralytic shellfish poisoning, the researchers found no evidence that the 1995 bloom was toxic. However, large algal blooms of any type pose an additional risk by lowering the available oxygen in the surrounding water when they decay, causing small marine animals, such as zooplankton and fish, to suffocate. "Considering the role urea seems to play in spurring or sustaining growth of phytoplankton, including harmful algal blooms, this organic nitrogen source should be taken into consideration by environmental agencies that conduct bloom mitigation efforts," Cochlan said. According to Kudela, these harmful bloom events are becoming more common off the California coastline. In addition to the dinoflagellate <i>Lingulodinium polyedrum,</i> the diatom species <i>Pseudo-nitzschia australis</i> also plagues California's coastal waters in deadly bloom form. <i>Pseudo-nitzschia</i> was recently identified as the culprit when more than 400 sea lions died and many more suffered from domoic acid poisoning on California's Central Coast in 1998. "However, there's no evidence that <i>Pseudo-nitzschia</i> responds to urea," Kudela noted. The researchers emphasized that red-tide-causing phytoplankton species are driven to bloom by varying mechanisms and nutrients, so it's important to examine and understand each species individually. Toward that end, the researchers have been awarded a grant from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Coastal Ocean Program to conduct a comprehensive field and lab study, along with several other groups on the West Coast, of the more deadly <i>Pseudo-nitzschia.</i>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_8637" align="alignright" width="200"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/02/rangell.00-02-28.200.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-8637" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/02/rangell.00-02-28.200.jpg" alt="One of five prints from The Millennium Portfolio,created by students Elan Kamesar, John Hardisty, Dior Kelley, and Annie Robb" width="200" height="150" /></a>One of five prints from The Millennium Portfolio,created by students Elan Kamesar, John Hardisty, Dior Kelley, and Annie Robb[/caption]
<p>
  Paul Rangell, a lecturer in art, realized that he had a particularly gifted and motivated group of students in a recent printmaking class. Sensing that he had an opportunity to do a little more than usual with his class, Rangell assigned an ambitious project. By quarter's end, Rangell's students had learned more than just technique--they had learned how to create and collaborate at a professional level. The proof came in the form of their completed project--a stunning publication titled <i>The Millennium Portfolio.</i> A collection of five color prints, the portfolio is an exquisite example of craftsmanship and conceptual integrity.
</p>Rangell began the quarter by putting his 21 students into five groups and defining a theme for them to base their work on. "I asked them to investigate the convergence of time and conflict in visual terms," he said. "I told them to keep in mind that this was also to be a kind of celebration of the millennium.""<br>
<br>
Students worked in a range of printmaking media, including stone lithography, relief printing, intaglio, photo lithography, computer imagery, and die-cutting. The resulting portfolio expressed the assigned concepts in an emotional range from playful to disturbing.<br>
<br>
Through a minigrant from the Center for Teaching Excellence, the cost of materials was covered, enabling the students to invest in a range of fine papers and diverse printing surfaces. The class was able to produce enough portfolios--25 in all--for each student to have their own. But for Rangell the less-tangible work the students took with them was equally important.<br>
<br>
"A lot of my energy on this project went into making the group work and making them teach each other and push each other. The students were of an unusually high level of skill, and the chemistry of the class was such that genuine respect, tolerance, and stimulation emerged. The group challenged each other to very high objectives of content, concept, and technique. Their physical stamina and work ethic were truly remarkable."<br>
<br>
Rangell has donated a copy of <i>The Millennium Portfolio</i> to Special Collections in McHenry Library. The portfolio can be viewed during Special Collections' regular hours. For information, call ext. 9-2547.

<p>
  and <a href="mailto:mckenna@cats.ucsc.edu">Barbara McKenna</a> Two UCSC faculty members--professor of computer science David Haussler and professor of philosophy David Hoy--have been appointed to UC Presidential Chairs on the Santa Cruz campus.
</p>Chancellor Greenwood made the appointments, which will extend from July 1, 2000, through June 30, 2001, and may be renewed for up to two additional years. Annual support for each chair is approximately $45,000.<br>
<br>
"I am already looking forward to following the work these two outstanding scholars will conduct as Presidential Chairs," Greenwood said. "Both professors crafted exceptional proposals that will support research by faculty and graduate students across disciplinary boundaries. Their projects have the potential to generate activity that will have an impact well beyond the borders of the campus and long after the chair appointments end."<br>
<br>
The Santa Cruz campus has appointed three Presidential Chairs in the past: Professor Hayden White, Historical Studies (1983-88), Professor Richard Wasserstrom, Moral Philosophy (1988-91), and Professor Angela Davis, African American and Feminist Studies (1995-97).<br>
<br>
The president of the University of California supports Presidential Chairs on each of the nine UC campuses through an endowment established in 1981 by the UC Regents. The positions are offered to distinguished members of the university's faculty and are intended to encourage new or interdisciplinary program development or to enhance quality in existing academic programs.<br>
<br>
Haussler received the award in recognition of his outstanding scholarship and continuing efforts to develop a graduate program in bioinformatics at UCSC. Bioinformatics is a new discipline that has emerged at the intersection of computer science and biotechnology, bringing the power of advanced computational techniques to bear on complex problems in molecular biology. Haussler, who directs UCSC's Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering, heads a prominent research group in bioinformatics and is working to establish graduate and undergraduate degree programs in this field.<br>
<br>
He plans to use the resources that accompany the Presidential Chair to fund three fellowships for graduate students in bioinformatics. "Santa Cruz has an excellent opportunity to develop a unique program with a focus on the information technology and engineering technology that advance the field of biomolecular engineering," he said.<br>
<br>
Haussler joined the UCSC faculty in 1986 after several years on the faculty of the University of Denver. He received his B.A. in mathematics from Connecticut College, M.S. in applied mathematics from California Polytechnic State University at San Luis Obispo, and Ph.D. in computer science from the University of Colorado at Boulder.<br>
<br>
Haussler has published papers in 30 different journals in computer science, mathematics, statistics, physics, and molecular biology, and his work has been cited more than 2000 times in journal articles and papers from scientific conferences. He was one of the founders of the field of computational learning theory, which now has three annual conferences in the U.S., Europe, and Japan, and he is a fellow of the American Association of Artificial Intelligence. In the early 1980s, he worked on computer analysis of the first viral and bacterial genome sequences with colleagues at the University of Colorado. He is known for introducing to the field of bioinformatics a now widely used technique called hidden Markov modeling.<br>
<br>
Hoy, who came to UCSC in 1981, has a long-standing history of initiating interdisciplinary approaches to critical thinking. In addition to more than 50 essays, he has authored and edited several books, among them, <i>Critical Theory</i> (with Thomas McCarthy), <i>Foucault: A Critical Reader,</i> and <i>The Critical Circle</i> (on literary theory and philosophical hermeneutics). A 1998 recipient of UCSC's Excellence in Teaching Award, Hoy has directed five National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) Summer Institutes at UCSC and has received well over $1 million in grants to train college professors to become better teachers.<br>
<br>
Hoy's project will support three research clusters--one for each year of the duration of his appointment. Titled, "Critical Theory," "Consciousness, Meaning, and Embodied Agency," and "The Philosophy and History of Science, Mathematics, and Technology," the clusters will be structured as multidisciplinary collaborative groups made up of faculty and graduate students. The clusters will, as Hoy says, "close gaps that are both geographical and disciplinary."<br>
<br>
Hoy notes, "The research clusters will also lead to interdisciplinary publications that will try to break down the barriers between entrenched ways of thinking. These research clusters will improve teaching by finding ways to challenge the current practice of making graduate students into narrow specialists at a time when we really need broader horizons and different ways of thinking."<br>
<br>
Hoy has already secured tentative commitments to the project from faculty in such varied disciplines as anthropology, art history, biology, engineering, linguistics, literature, mathematics, philosophy, physics, and psychology. Participants will focus on the designated research topic, meeting weekly as a group and one-on-one with Hoy. Funding from the chair will support stipends for graduate students as well as academic release time to enable participants to focus fully on this collaborative research.<br>
<br>
In addition to supporting research and publication on these topics, the three clusters will spawn other projects. For instance, Hoy plans to use the imminent publication of his book, <i>Critical Resistance,</i> as a vehicle that would provide the framework for another book of related essays, edited by Hoy and written by cluster participants, including graduate students. And, Hoy adds, "The themes of this research cluster could also be the basis for a proposal to the NEH for another Summer Institute."<br>
<br>
Similar outcomes will follow in the second year as he completes his book entitled, "A History of Consciousness." "My principal goal," Hoy says "is to increase the visibility of UCSC as a source of creative multidisciplinary research and as a place that fosters bold ideas."

<p>
  "The rituals of courtship may change, but at the center of romance is always the desire of a man and a woman to say 'I do' with style."
</p>So says Wynton Marsalis, artistic director of the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra (LCJO), which will be in Santa Cruz April 12 as part of Arts & Lectures 1999-2000 season.<br>
<br>
In Marsalis's mind, dance is one of the world's best expressions of romance. "There is nothing more stylish than the sensuous movements of bodies on a dance floor and no sound more soulful than the joyous motion of swing with the bittersweet cry of the blues," he says.<br>
<br>
Which explains why the orchestra, of which Marsalis is artistic director, is touring a show this spring entitled "For Dancers Only." The show takes its name from a 1937 classic written by Sy Oliver and celebrates one of jazz's most exuberant and engaging offshoots--swing.<br>
<br>
Swing has regained its rightful place as a popular dance form in recent years, drawing dancers out of the woodwork with its playful, lively rhythms and catchy melodies. In the hands of one of the country's premiere jazz ensembles, an evening of swing will be an evening to remember. "For Dancers Only" will feature many classic swing pieces, written by such composers as Duke Ellington, Count Basie, and Benny Goodman, as well as many new dance works commissioned by bandleader/saxophonist Andy Farber, LCJO trombonist Wycliffe Gordon, and others.<br>
<br>
Even those with two-left-feet syndrome can enjoy the exceptional musical performances of Marsalis and his world-class ensemble. The show will be performed in the magical setting of the Cocoanut Grove Ballroom, with a range of seating choices and a preconcert buffet dinner.<br>
<br>
Last year, the LCJO took Santa Cruz by storm in a sold-out concert of works by Duke Ellington. This year's performance may disprove the adage that lightning never strikes twice in the same place. Buy tickets early, if you want to find out firsthand. For tickets and more information, call ext. 9-2159 or visit <a href="http://events.ucsc.edu/artslecs/">http://events.ucsc.edu/artslecs/</a>

  <b>David Cope</b>'s Experiments in Musical Intelligence was the subject of a story on CNET about recently developed computer programs that can be used to make music. Cope was also featured in a segment on ABC's <i>World News Now.</i> The two-minute segment used a short clip from a film by Porter academic preceptor <b>Bob Giges</b> on Cope titled <i>Bach Lives!...At David Cope's House.</i> Because the film was used, UCSC conductor <b>Nicole Paiement</b> also made a cameo on the air. <b><br>
  <br></b>Anthropologist <b>Nancy Chen</b>'s expertise in qigong and Falun Gong is well known among journalists, the most recent of whom talked with her while reporting an article for the <i>New York Times</i> about cancer patients in China who are trying to harness the invisible forces of qigong to fight their disease.

  <b>Brent Haddad</b> of environmental studies is fielding calls about his new book on water policy. He was interviewed by a reporter with American News Service and appeared on KSCO Radio. Next up is KUSP Radio, where he'll appear on March 27 at 12:30 p.m.

  Last week's vote on mandatory grades attracted coverage from the local media, including the <i>Santa Cruz County Sentinel</i> and KCBA-TV, as well as beyond the local area. The <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> joined the <i>San Jose Mercury News</i> in covering the story, and both papers quoted several faculty members and instructors, including <b>Bob Ludwig</b>, <b>George Brown</b>, <b>Geoffrey Pullum</b>, <b>Dan Linger</b>, <b>Barbara Rogoff</b>, <b>Tim Fitzmaurice</b>, <b>Peter Euben</b>, and <b>Martha Zuniga</b>. KQED Radio's coverage included interviews with <b>Daniel Press</b>, <b>Barry Bowman</b>, and <b>Roger Anderson</b>.

<p>
  In a <i>Metro Santa Cruz</i> story on UCSC alum Marti Noxon, women's studies scholar <b>Bettina Aptheker</b> was credited as being the inspiration for an episode of <i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer,</i> the WB channel show about a teenager who fights forces of darkness in the halls of her high school by day and in the vampire world by night. Aptheker herself isn't a vampire expert, but she does know a lot about goddesses, and Noxon, who writes for the hit show, said themes in an episode called "The Wish" were inspired by Aptheker's class lectures on goddesses.<br>
  <br>
  The intensive news coverage of the discovery by astronomer <b>Anthony Misch</b> of a manuscript by Johannes Kepler persisted when <i>National Geographic</i> magazine ran a half-page story in its January 2000 issue.<br>

        <title>Guatemala's peace requires international support, says author</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 28 Feb 2000 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>8628</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_8627" align="alignright" width="180"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/02/jonas.00-02-28.180.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-8627" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/02/jonas.00-02-28.180.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="283" /></a>[/caption]
<p>
  In a world plagued by civil wars, many of them involving ethnic clashes, the peace process that ended Guatemala's bloody 36-year civil war stands as evidence that seemingly intractable conflicts can be resolved at the negotiating table. Three years after the signing of peace accords between leftist insurgents and a U.S.-supported government, the new book, <i>Of Centaurs and Doves: Guatemala's Peace Process</i> by Susanne Jonas, details the long and bumpy road to Guatemala's historic peace and provides up-to-the-minute analysis of the first three years of implementation of the United Nations-mediated agreements.<br>
  <br>
</p>"The accords aren't perfect, especially the one dealing with social and economic issues, but they set in motion the mechanisms for major change," said Jonas, who teaches Latin American and Latino studies at UCSC and is a leading expert on Central America and Guatemala. "On paper, they constitute a program for a new Guatemala. But in practice, everything depends on their implementation, and that has generated a second round of struggles."<br>
<br>
With a new government having just taken office this January, the coming year will be crucial to the realization of all that the peace accords promise, she said. But the burden of proof lies with the new government, whose political party had opposed the peace negotiations. According to Jonas there is a small window of opportunity now. "The government will be under pressure from pro-peace forces in Guatemalan civil society and from the newly legalized political Left," she said. "But by themselves, these internal forces are not strong enough to guarantee governmental compliance."<br>
<br>
Hence, pressure from the international community--including the U.S. government--will be key, said Jonas, whose previous books include <i>The Battle for Guatemala</i> and <i>Immigration: A Civil Rights Issue for the Americas.</i> "The international organizations and governments that supported Guatemala's peace negotiations will have to remain vigilant to assure an enduring peace," she said. "The stakes are very high: If this attempt to bring change to Guatemala fails, the country may not have another chance for decades."<br>
<br>
Jonas's new book is the first English-language book-length account of Guatemala's difficult peace negotiation and postwar progress. The Guatemalan peace process is a source of lessons for the Americas and beyond, and Jonas's analysis addresses broader issues about revolution, negotiation, peacemaking, democratization, and the role of U.S. interests overseas.<br>
<br>
Guatemala has captured the hearts and minds of people around the world in part because of the jarring juxtaposition of the country's natural beauty and diverse indigenous cultures with the extreme brutality of its counterinsurgency army, which has tainted Guatemalan politics ever since the 1954 U.S. covert intervention in the country. International efforts to publicize the army's genocidal actions during the early 1980s helped mobilize grassroots support from religious groups, human rights organizations, and indigenous rights networks, but few believed the war could end through political negotiations. What made the difference was a combination of factors--both domestic and international--that compelled the army to begin negotiating despite its military strength, asserts Jonas.<br>
<br>
"The brutality of the war, in which more than 200,000 civilians were killed or 'disappeared,' and the seeming invincibility of the army, made the negotiated end of the conflict all the more remarkable," said Jonas. "The army had to negotiate in large measure because of its record as Latin America's most brutal counterinsurgency apparatus." A major lesson emerging from Guatemala and El Salvador was the ending of these Cold War civil wars through negotiations, rather than winners imposing the terms of peace on losers, she said.<br>
<br>
The wide-ranging peace accords are ambitious, containing hundreds of commitments. Jonas's book chronicles the step-by-step process of peace talks that began in 1991 and examines the contents of the accords, which were signed in December 1996. Two of the most important accords regard the rights and identities of Guatemala's indigenous peoples, who make up 60 percent of the population, and demilitarization, which Jonas said is the key to democratizing Guatemala. "The indigenous accord goes far beyond anti-discrimination provisions to establish political and cultural rights and redefine Guatemala as a multiethnic, multicultural, and multilingual nation," she noted.<br>
<br>
The second half of the book chronicles the battles to implement the accords. Both the indigenous and demilitarization accords suffered a tremendous setback with the defeat last May of a ballot referendum that would have reformed the Constitution. Jonas attributes that outcome largely to a last-minute, well-financed "no" campaign launched by opponents that relied heavily on racist, anti-indigenous arguments. The stunning defeat sent an unmistakable "wake-up call" to advocates and supporters of the peace accords, but Jonas predicts that internal pro-peace forces will succeed only if they are strengthened by support from the international community.

<p>
  UC Santa Cruz's Academic Senate voted overwhelmingly on Wednesday (February 23) for a proposal that would make letter grades mandatory for entering UCSC students in fall 2001. The Narrative Evaluation System, a hallmark of the student assessment process at UCSC throughout the campus's 35-year history, was officially unchanged by Wednesday's vote.
</p>The 154-77 vote in favor of instituting UC's traditional grading system sets the stage for discussion of the Narrative Evaluation System (NES) at the next senate meeting, on May 31.
<p>
  Introducing the grades proposal at the senate meeting, physics professor George Brown, chair of the senate's Committee on Educational Policy (CEP), promised that his committee would present "compatible legislation" on the NES at the spring meeting. After the vote, Brown said he expected that the CEP would draft a proposal that would "reform" the NES, not do away with it.
</p>
<p>
  Speakers at Wednesday's senate meeting repeated many of the arguments raised by faculty and students on both sides of the recent debate over UCSC's student evaluation system.
</p>
<p>
  Martha Zuniga, an associate professor of biology, said UCSC students who choose not to receive grades--and therefore don't acquire a grade-point average--are disadvantaged when they compete for fellowships against students from other campuses. Others added that a reliance on the NES has impacted UCSC's ability to attract top students and hurts the students when they apply to graduate schools elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
  Peter Euben, a professor of politics, saw it differently. Euben said a policy that makes grades mandatory would erode the NES. "I think we have to be clear that is what will happen," he said, adding he would prefer to have the option to "teach without grades and have students learn without grades."
</p>
<p>
  Specifically, the resolution approved Wednesday will require students who first enter UCSC one and one-half years from now to take no more than 25 percent of their UCSC course work on a Pass/No Pass (P/NP) basis. The resolution, offered by CEP, recommended that the issues of grades and the NES be considered separately "so that the complex matter of narrative evaluations can be subsequently debated, as an entirely independent matter."
</p>
<p>
  The new legislation also introduces plus (+) and minus (-) modifiers for grades (A, B, and C only) and will require that a notation of NP be recorded on the student's transcript; the present UCSC policy does not record NP work.
</p>
<p>
  Wednesday's vote may yet be challenged as part of the senate's approval process. Those rules permit 25 senate members to request that the matter be presented to all 588 members of the senate via a "mail ballot." Faculty on both sides of the issue expected that request to be made and that a final outcome might not be known for at least two months.
</p>
<p>
  The winter-quarter meeting on Wednesday was the first session of the senate since December, when members called a special meeting to consider replacing the NES with the conventional UC grading system. That meeting was prompted by a petition signed by more than 170 members of the senate.
</p>
<p>
  By a one-vote margin, the senate in December moved the matter to committee for consideration. The senate's Committee on Rules, Jurisdiction, and Elections subsequently reviewed the parliamentary procedures surrounding that vote and deemed the vote to be "inconclusive." CEP, meanwhile, assumed that it had been given the referral and wrote the legislation that was presented to the full senate Wednesday.
</p>
<p>
  The two recent meetings mark the third time in seven years that UCSC's student assessment policies have been the subject of Academic Senate debate.
</p>
<p>
  In an informational action intended to guide NES deliberations by the CEP, senate members participated in a spirited debate in June 1993 before voting to maintain NES in its present form. In the fall of 1996, however, senate members voted by a two-to-one margin to permit new and continuing students to request letter grades for most classes, beginning in fall 1997.
</p>
<p>
  The change retained the NES, but enabled new students to accumulate a grade-point average. During this past academic year, approximately one-third of UCSC's students requested grades.

        <title>New program helps with employment searches for spouses, partners</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  In an effort to better serve ladder-rank faculty and senior management, UCSC has established the Dual Career Service program as a career support service for the spouses and partners of candidates and appointees for these positions. Because seeking, accepting, and maintaining employment at UCSC often hinges on the feasibility of a second career, the service program will provide assistance and support during the employment searches of the spouse or partner. However, the program is not for job placement and does not guarantee employment for clients. "Employment searches can be challenging to face alone," said Nancy Aebersold, coordinator of Dual Career Service. "I see my role as a supporter of eligible spouses and partners who have career needs. The Dual Career Service is a source of career ideas, resources, opportunities, tools, and creativity--a place to get help from someone who cares." Program services include:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Confidential career assessment and counseling;
  </li>
  <li>Information about employment opportunities at UCSC and Bay Area educational institutions;
  </li>
  <li>Networking opportunities with Bay Area employers;
  </li>
  <li>Forwarding resumes to potential employers;
  </li>
  <li>Brokering creative strategies for developing employment solutions;
  </li>
  <li>Assistance navigating through Web resources;
  </li>
  <li>Providing referrals to career partners--such as the Career Action Center in Cupertino--where clients can access additional job-search resources.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  The eligible population for this program are spouses and partners of full-time university appointees who are members of the Academic Senate or who hold equivalent academic titles, members of the Senior Management Group, and acting assistant professors.<br>
  <br>
  Services are offered to spouses or partners during recruitment, at the time a new appointment is made, when retention is an issue for the UCSC employee and the spouse or partner's career needs are a consideration, and under special circumstances and with the approval of an administrator.<br>
  <br>
  For additional information, contact Nancy Aebersold in Academic Human Resources at ext. 9-3891 or nancyaae@cats.ucsc.edu.<br>

  Mark Franko, professor of theater arts (dance), was invited by a Portuguese arts organization to consult in Lisbon on "Panorama: A speculative history of the moving body," an installation to circulate throughout Europe and North America in 2000-01. He also read a paper titled, "The Readymade as Movement: Cunningham, Duchamp and the Two Merces" at the conference "Remaking the Readymade: The Afterlife of an Artistic Idea" at UCSC. Recently, Franko was also invited to Paris to talk in seminars on visual anthropology, dance, and the anthropology of emotion at both the College de France and the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales.

<p>
  At the recent 47th Annual Western Regional Meeting of the College Board in Honolulu, Francisco Hernandez, vice chancellor for Student Affairs, participated in a discussion of UC's new initiative to provide online access to advanced placement classes. Hernandez was joined by Nancy Giberson, assistant superintendent of the San Diego County Office of Education, in the discussion of the UC College Prep Initiative (UCCP), which makes online AP courses available to high school students who do not have adequate opportunities to prepare for college. Thirteen schools from San Diego and Imperial Counties participated in the initial pilot program. Hernandez, as executive director of UCCP, discussed the program's implications for students and school districts and the future of distance education for preparing high school students for college. He and Giberson also discussed issues of equity and access to courses in general and to online courses in particular.

  Waskell created a distinctive visual style during the videotaping of the program segments that captured the appetizing quality of the sushi. Cashen then edited the video into an effective information program that conveyed the required information, while creating a mood that carried the piece.

[caption id="attachment_8607" align="alignright" width="200"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/02/grades.st.00-02-28.200.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-8607" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/02/grades.st.00-02-28.200.jpg" alt="Approximately 150 students came to listen to the Academic Senate's discussion on the grades proposal." width="200" height="179" /></a>Approximately 150 students came to listen to the Academic Senate's discussion on the grades proposal.[/caption]
<p>
  UC Santa Cruz's Academic Senate voted overwhelmingly on Wednesday for a proposal that would make letter grades mandatory for entering UCSC students in fall 2001. The Narrative Evaluation System, a hallmark of the student assessment process at UCSC throughout the campus's 35-year history, was officially unchanged by Wednesday's vote.
</p>The 154-77 vote in favor of instituting UC's traditional grading system sets the stage for discussion of the Narrative Evaluation System (NES) at the next senate meeting, on May 31.
<p>
  Introducing the grades proposal at the senate meeting, physics professor George Brown, chair of the senate's Committee on Educational Policy (CEP), promised that his committee would present "compatible legislation" on the NES at the spring meeting. After the vote, Brown said he expected that the CEP would draft a proposal that would "reform" the NES, not do away with it.
</p>
<p>
  Speakers at Wednesday's senate meeting repeated many of the arguments raised by faculty and students on both sides of the recent debate over UCSC's student evaluation system.
</p>Martha Zuniga, an associate professor of biology, said UCSC students who choose not to receive grades--and therefore don't acquire a grade-point average--are disadvantaged when they compete for fellowships against students from other campuses. Others added that a reliance on the NES has impacted UCSC's ability to attract top students and hurts the students when they apply to graduate schools elsewhere.
<p>
  Peter Euben, a professor of politics, saw it differently. Euben said a policy that makes grades mandatory would erode the NES. "I think we have to be clear that is what will happen," he said, adding he would prefer to have the option to "teach without grades and have students learn without grades."
</p>
<p>
  Specifically, the resolution approved Wednesday will require students who enter UCSC one and one-half years from now to take no more than 25 percent of their UCSC course work on a Pass/No Pass (P/NP) basis. The resolution, offered by CEP, recommended that the issues of grades and the NES be considered separately "so that the complex matter of narrative evaluations can be subsequently debated, as an entirely independent matter."
</p>
<p>
  The new legislation also introduces plus (+) and minus (-) modifiers for grades (A, B, and C only) and will require that a notation of NP be recorded on the student's transcript; the present UCSC policy does not record NP work.
</p>
<p>
  Wednesday's vote may yet be challenged as part of the senate's approval process. Those rules permit 25 senate members to request that the matter be presented to all 588 members of the senate via a "mail ballot." Faculty on both sides of the issue expected that request to be made and that a final outcome might not be known for at least two months.
</p>
<p>
  The winter-quarter meeting on Wednesday was the first session of the senate since December, when members called a special meeting to consider replacing the NES with the conventional UC grading system. That meeting was prompted by a petition signed by more than 170 members of the senate.
</p>
<p>
  By a one-vote margin, the senate in December moved the matter to committee for consideration. The senate's Committee on Rules, Jurisdiction, and Elections subsequently reviewed the parliamentary procedures surrounding that vote and deemed the vote to be "inconclusive." CEP, meanwhile, assumed that it had been given the referral and wrote the legislation that was presented to the full senate Wednesday.
</p>
<p>
  The two recent meetings mark the third time in seven years that UCSC's student assessment policies have been the subject of Academic Senate debate.
</p>
<p>
  In an informational action intended to guide NES deliberations by the CEP, senate members participated in a spirited debate in June 1993 before voting to maintain NES in its present form. In the fall of 1996, however, senate members voted by a two-to-one margin to permit new and continuing students to request letter grades for most classes, beginning in fall 1997.
</p>
<p>
  The change retained the NES, but enabled new students to accumulate a grade-point average. During this past academic year, approximately one-third of UCSC's students requested grades.

<p>
  Faculty and staff are invited to "Leap on Down" to Long Marine Lab on February 29 between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. for a special preview of the Seymour Marine Discovery Center. The public grand opening of the center will take place on March 11 and 12.
</p>The Seymour Center is a new public education center at Long Marine Lab, featuring galleries full of aquaria, exhibits, touch tanks, an 87-foot blue whale skeleton, a gift and book shop, and much more. Overlooking the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, this beautiful new facility offers visitors a unique view into the workings of a world-class marine research laboratory. Exhibits focus on the work of researchers in UCSC's Institute of Marine Sciences, which operates Long Marine Lab.<br>
<br>
Extra shuttle buses to Long Marine Lab will stop at all campus SC Metro stops every 20 minutes starting at 10:30 a.m.<br>
<br>
Memberships to the Friends of Long Marine Lab will be available at a 10% discount only during this preview event (regular memberships start at $20 students/seniors and $35 individual). Members can visit the center free all year long and will also receive an invitation to the members' opening event on March 5.

        <title>Debate on NES continues at Convocation on Teaching</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 21 Feb 2000 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>8615</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  The February 14 Convocation on Teaching was centered on the discussion of UCSC's Narrative Evaluation System (NES), with supporters arguing that it promotes "durable understanding" and critics charging that the system has devolved to the point that many narratives are simply "thinly veiled grades."
</p>The convocation was the final public discussion prior to the February 23 meeting of the Academic Senate, during which the senate will consider adopting a conventional mandatory grading system.<br>
<br>
The topic of the sixth annual convocation was "NES and Pedagogy: Are Narrative Evaluations Important to Teaching and Learning at UCSC?" The Center for Teaching Excellence and the Academic Senate's Committee on Teaching cosponsored the convocation.<br>
<br>
More than 70 people attended the session, during which five panelists spoke and audience members contributed to the discussion.<br>
<br>
"Narratives allow me to evaluate the student's journey through the course rather than as a final outcome," said Carolyn Dean, associate professor of art history, who characterized grades as one-dimensional.<br>
<br>
The student representative on the panel, Juan Caballero, said that grades put a barrier between him and his teachers and didn't reward challenging, original approaches to assignments.<br>
<br>
Barbara Rogoff, UC Santa Cruz Foundation Professor of Psychology and author of a proposal to streamline the NES, asserted that grades encouraged short-term compliance and rote memorization over depth of understanding. "Our NES promotes deep and durable understanding," she said. With the NES, students see teachers as resources rather than as obstacles, said Rogoff, adding that the NES "fosters students learning from each other and learning to learn."<br>
<br>
Rogoff maintained that the NES would greatly benefit the increasing number of students who are the first in their family to go to college. "To pay attention to their strengths and weaknesses in a multidimensional way is important," Rogoff said.<br>
<br>
Many students, like undergraduate and Regents Scholar Caballero, said they came to UCSC in part because of the opportunity to learn under the narrative system. He said his experience with traditional grading encumbered his learning process. "The grade hovers over you and gets in the way between you and learning," Caballero said.<br>
<br>
But critics of the NES said that narratives have outlived their usefulness at UCSC. The current way narratives are put into practice, they have essentially become "thinly veiled grades" with their use of key words like "very good" and "excellent," said Daniel Guevara, associate professor of philosophy.<br>
<br>
Guevara acknowledged that narratives had some positive impacts on student learning, such as students coming into office hours to talk about material rather than the grades they received. But students now demand that their narratives contain key words like "excellent" that are translatable into grades. "We may have something called a NES, but the practice and culture have changed," said Guevara. He said he can provide students with more precise written and verbal feedback throughout the quarter than he can in a narrative.<br>
<br>
Anthony Tromba, professor of mathematics, spoke strongly against mandatory evaluations, citing several reasons, including the increasing number of students choosing grades and negative media portrayals of UCSC as "flaky."<br>
<br>
"Even if narratives do provide a detailed, clear assessment of student performance, do they give our students a competitive edge in finding employment?" asked Tromba, whose own research into federal hiring practices found that UCSC students are at a serious disadvantage because the federal government will not look at narrative evaluations.<br>
<br>
"For narratives to be successful, they must be optional," Tromba said. Indeed, many speakers, even those who support the NES, called for compromises. One suggestion was "shadow" grades in which students would receive a grade-point average but would not have to have it on their transcript--or even see it--unless they chose to do so.<br>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  At its winter-quarter meeting on Wednesday, February 23, the Academic Senate will be asked to consider legislation that would bring UC's conventional grading system to UCSC.
</p>

<p>
  The meeting begins at 3 p.m. in Classroom Unit 2. The Senate's Committee on Educational Policy (CEP), which is proposing the legislation, wants to separate the issues of grades and UCSC's Narrative Evaluation System."This resolution is silent on the matter of narrative evaluations. The CEP believes that it would be most prudent to separate the two issues, so that the complex matter of narrative evaluations can be subsequently debated, as an entirely independent matter."
</p>

<p>
  The CEP recommends that "no more than 25 percent of the UCSC course work applied toward graduation credit may be taken on a Pass/No Pass basis." This is equivalent to or stricter than all other UC campuses. The proposal introduces pluses and minuses for grades A, B, and C.

        <title>Sexual harassment law weakened by recent cases, book says</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_8612" align="alignright" width="180"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/02/mink_book.00-02-21.180.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-8612" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/02/mink_book.00-02-21.180.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="272" /></a>[/caption]
<p>
  In her new book, <i>Hostile Environment: The Political Betrayal of Sexually Harassed Women,</i> political scientist Gwendolyn Mink warns that despite great strides in the development of sexual harassment law, the political and social costs of actually using the law silence sexually harassed women in all but the most egregious cases.
</p>In today's climate, women are subjected to what Mink calls a "regime of disbelief" that surrounds sexual harassment: Their credibility is questioned, their motives are considered suspect, their morality is trampled, and their personal lives are often exposed and defamed.<br>
<br>
"The treatment of women in recent high-profile cases sends a message to women about what's in store for them if they come forward," said Mink, a professor of politics at UCSC. "We must make it possible for targets of sexual harassment to speak up by insisting on a process and a social context that respects the validity of their claims."<br>
<br>
From the start, the regime of disbelief tainted Paula Jones's case against President Clinton, when Jones was immediately maligned as a "trailer-park floozy" looking for a book deal. As the Monica Lewinsky scandal jeopardized Clinton's presidency, the president's defenders not only disparaged Jones but denied that what she said Clinton had done to her was sexual harassment at all.<br>
<br>
Mink expressed her views on the opinion pages of the <i>New York Times</i> and through other media channels during the Jones case, but she notes that she makes no judgments regarding the veracity of Jones's claims. "During the case, I had no grounds for knowing what to believe, and neither did the people who insisted Jones was telling a lie," said Mink. "What's important is the fairness of the legal process to somebody who tries to avail herself of a civil rights remedy."<br>
<br>
Sexual harassment can take different forms, from physical contact to verbal harassment to leers. Current estimates are that close to half of all women will experience sexual harassment in some form during their working lives. It first catapulted to the forefront of the nation's attention with Anita Hill's allegations against then-Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas. "The regime of disbelief has existed for every woman who has tried to make a claim, but we didn't collectively witness the regime in action until we all watched it work against Anita Hill," said Mink.<br>
<br>
"The core problem with the regime of disbelief is how political it is," added Mink. "In every case, high-profile or not, political judgments are made about the veracity of the claim depending on partisan alliances, moral assumptions, and the relative power of the alleged perpetrator. Friends of harassers breed doubt."<br>
<br>
In her book, Mink charts the history of sexual harassment as a legal concept, corrects many common misconceptions about the law, and recounts her own experience of a sexual harassment grievance as a graduate student. Firsthand knowledge of the injuries caused by sexual harassment--and by complaining about it--has contributed to Mink's advocacy on behalf of sexually harassed women.<br>
<br>
"When you see how poorly targets of sexual harassment are treated, it's not hard to see the inhibiting effect the climate has on other women," said Mink, who was so disheartened by her own experience seeking redress as a graduate student that she decided to do nothing years later when she encountered harassment as an untenured professor. "It took place within my profession, although not at my place of employment, and I knew what I was in for," she recalled. "I just couldn't face it."<br>
<br>
Recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions on sexual harassment have fallen on both sides of the mark, said Mink, who is not optimistic about near-term legislative efforts to bolster sexual harassment law. "Recent events showed that laws are useless if they operate in the regime of disbelief," she said. "The regime of disbelief can't be legislated away, but individuals can help to dismantle it." Mink urged people to scrutinize their own reactions to public cases, to learn about the law and about how sexual harassment interferes with women's opportunities and abilities to do their jobs, and to ensure that their workplaces have appropriate procedures to handle complaints.

  Kitty Klaidman has been exhibiting her work since the mid-1960s in New York, London, Paris, Los Angeles, Washington, and other cities in Europe and the U.S. She currently has work in a traveling exhibition called "Witness and Legacy," which is touring museums throughout the country. Much of her work has been concerned with depicting physical fragments that prod us to remember the best and the worst of our history and culture. The UCSC exhibit draws on Klaidman's own history as a child in wartime Czechoslovakia, when she and her family were forced to hide in a dark, confined space for a year, but from which they emerged alive thanks to courageous Slovak farmers who hid them at the risk of their own lives. A later group of paintings in this exhibition commemorates the American dead at Normandy.

        <title>Computational techniques analyze data from the Human Genome Project</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  A new discipline has emerged at the intersection of computer science and biotechnology, bringing the power of advanced computational techniques to bear on complex problems in molecular biology. Called bioinformatics or computational biology, this new field is providing essential tools for scientists on the leading edge of research in genetics and other fundamental areas of biology. Gene-sequencing efforts such as the Human Genome Project, combined with new techniques for studying the activity of genes in living cells, are generating enormous amounts of raw data. These data are accumulating at a rapidly accelerating pace in a variety of public computer databases, such as those maintained by the National Center for Biotechnology Information at the National Institutes of Health. "The driving force behind bioinformatics is the availability of these large databases and the need to come up with sophisticated computer models for extracting useful information from them," said David Haussler, professor of computer science at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Haussler discussed the use of computational techniques to analyze genetic data in a talk Saturday (February 19) at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Washington, D.C. Haussler, who directs UCSC's Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering, recently joined the Human Genome Project's bioinformatics team. Bioinformatics is playing an increasingly important role in the project, an international effort to identify and understand all of the roughly 100,000 human genes. "Computer analysis will be an integral part of identifying genes and understanding their functions," Haussler said. The set of genetic instructions for making an organism--its genome--is contained in long, threadlike DNA molecules neatly packaged into chromosomes within the nucleus of every cell. The sequence of chemical units in the DNA is a kind of code that specifies the structures of protein molecules, which carry out most of the functions of living cells. The complete DNA sequence of the human genome, if compiled in books, would fill 200 volumes the size of the Manhattan telephone book. Human Genome Project scientists are close to having a rough draft of this sequence, but that will only be a first step. Buried within the genome sequence are the genes--DNA sequences that encode specific proteins--which ultimately determine all the inherited characteristics of humans. Locating genes within genomic DNA sequences is one of the first tasks for which scientists have turned to bioinformatics. Less than 10 percent of the human genome is thought to comprise protein-coding gene sequences. Interspersed with the genes are control sequences, which regulate gene activity, and other "noncoding regions" whose functions are obscure. Haussler and his coworkers at UC Santa Cruz have developed some of the most effective computational techniques for finding genes in DNA sequences. They introduced a now widely used statistical method called hidden Markov modeling to attack this problem. To analyze the rough draft of the human genome sequence, Haussler is working closely with researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Whitehead Institute. The Whitehead Institute is one of five major sequencing sites involved in the Human Genome Project. Working with the rough draft, however, will be a monumentally difficult task, Haussler said. "The problem is that the rough draft does not provide a continuous DNA sequence across each chromosome--many regions of the genome are covered only by small pieces," he said. The first task Haussler and the Whitehead group are tackling is to line up all of the segments of the human genome sequenced so far in their proper order and orientations along the chromosomes. The next step will be to locate genes within the genome sequence. This will be done in collaboration with Neomorphic, a Berkeley-based genomics company, using a computer program called Genie. Genie was initially developed by Haussler's group and researchers at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL). It was exclusively licensed and further developed by Neomorphic, which was founded by a group of scientists from LBNL, UC Berkeley, and UCSC. Genie was recently used to identify genes in the genome of the fruit fly, <i>Drosophila melanogaster,</i> which was sequenced last year. Neomorphic is now developing a new version of Genie optimized for the rough draft of the human genome sequence. Research on the genetics of organisms such as <i>Drosophila,</i> yeast, and the roundworm <i>Caenorhabditis elegans</i> has helped lay the groundwork for studying the much more complex genome of humans. Many human genes are closely related to genes found in these simpler organisms, which are widely used as model systems for research in genetics and molecular biology. Studies of these model organisms have already yielded many valuable insights into gene functions, normal gene regulation, genetic diseases, and evolutionary processes. According to Haussler, the role for bioinformatics in this type of research is steadily increasing as the experimental methods become more sophisticated and complex. DNA microarrays or "gene chips," for example, provide valuable information about gene expression--when, where, and to what extent specific genes are active. This information is critical to understanding a gene's biological function. But gene chips, like genomic-sequencing technology, produce enormous amounts of data that can only be analyzed and understood using sophisticated computational approaches. "There is a lot of information pertaining to gene function that is becoming available as a result of large-scale experiments using gene chips and other methods, which generate massive datasets relating to the functions of thousands of genes," Haussler said. To analyze these complex datasets, Haussler is pioneering the use of a new statistical method based on the theory of support vector machines (SVMs). SVMs are able to handle high-dimensional datasets in which each data point has many features or attributes. "It's hard to visualize because we live in a three-dimensional world, and we're talking about analyzing datasets in ten thousand or more dimensions. But we're finding SVMs extremely useful for gene chip data," Haussler said. Genomic sequencing and gene chips represent what Haussler calls "high-throughput genomic technologies," powerful new techniques for understanding molecular biology. The use of these techniques is increasing, and all of them present significant computational challenges. One of Haussler's goals is to develop new statistical and algorithmic methods for integrating these diverse types of genomic data.
</p>

<p>
  For the moment, analyzing the rough draft of the human genome sequence is the focus of Haussler's efforts. But in the long run, he foresees a happy and prosperous future for the marriage of computer science and molecular biology. The application of human genomics to areas such as drug discovery and clinical diagnostics, for example, will undoubtedly require new computational methodologies, he said.<br>
  <br>
  "Our vision for bioinformatics spans a broad spectrum, from basic molecular biology all the way up to clinical diagnostics," Haussler said.<br>

<p>
  Deep in Earth's interior is a dynamo that creates the planet's magnetic field--a kind of generator driven not by spinning turbines but by swirling flows of liquid iron. The workings of this dynamo cannot be observed, but scientists have used computer simulations to gain powerful new insights into the operation of the "geodynamo" and the behavior of Earth's core.
</p>The first self-consistent, three-dimensional computer simulation of the geodynamo was achieved in 1995 by professor of earth sciences Gary Glatzmaier, then at Los Alamos National Laboratory, and Paul Roberts, professor of mathematics at UCLA. Glatzmaier, Roberts, and their coworkers have since refined and extended their simulations, shedding new light on the planet's inner workings.<br>
<br>
Glatzmaier presented the group's latest findings on Sunday, February 20, at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science in Washington, D.C. His collaborators include Robert Coe, professor of earth sciences, and postdoctoral researcher Lionel Hongre.<br>
<br>
The Glatzmaier-Roberts model of the geodynamo is essentially a complex set of equations describing the physics of Earth's core. Scientists had long speculated that the mechanism behind the geomagnetic field involved the motion of the Earth's fluid outer core, which surrounds a solid inner core. Both are composed mainly of iron. The solid inner core is about the size of the moon and as hot as the surface of the sun.<br>
<br>
The flow of heat from the core ultimately drives the geodynamo. "Basically, the whole thing works because the Earth is cooling off," Glatzmaier said. The cooling process results in fluid motions in the outer core that produce an electric current, which, like any electric current, generates a magnetic field.<br>
<br>
One of the initial achievements of the Glatzmaier-Roberts model of the geodynamo was the simulation of a reversal of Earth's magnetic field, when the north and south magnetic poles trade places. This phenomenon has occurred many times in the history of the planet, according to paleomagnetic records preserved in rocks that show the direction and strength of Earth's magnetism at the time the rocks formed.<br>
<br>
"We were able to get a magnetic field generated by the model that looks a lot like the Earth's and undergoes reversals," Glatzmaier said.<br>
<br>
The model also predicted that the solid inner core should rotate slightly faster than the surface of the Earth. This prediction was later supported by other researchers using evidence from seismic waves that pass through the core.<br>
<br>
Over the past five years, Glatzmaier and his coworkers have improved the precision and resolution of their model, taking advantage of advances in computer capacity. They have now run simulations spanning as much as 300,000 years and showing a pattern of magnetic-field reversals very similar to that seen in the paleomagnetic record.<br>
<br>
"We can run the simulation for 200,000 years and the magnetic field will be stable for a very long time--millions of time steps for which we solve these equations. Then within a thousand years it reverses polarity, and then it remains stable again for another long period. We were very happy to see that, because that's also what we see in the Earth's record," Glatzmaier said.<br>
<br>
He noted that the reversals are not triggered by an external influence on the geodynamo. "It is simply due to the very nonlinear, chaotic nature of the dynamo system," he said.<br>
<br>
The group's most recent efforts have focused on the role of the mantle in controlling the frequency of geomagnetic reversals. Temperature variations in the mantle, causing an uneven pattern of heat flow from the outer core into the mantle, may affect the fluid dynamics of the outer core. So Glatzmaier's group ran their simulation using eight different patterns of heat flow across the core-mantle boundary.<br>
<br>
The results, published in the October 28, 1999, issue of the journal <i>Nature,</i> showed that the pattern of heat flow determined by the mantle does have a big influence on the behavior of the geodynamo. The most Earthlike pattern of magnetic-field reversals occurred with a relatively uniform heat-flow pattern. This suggests that scientists may have overestimated the extent of thermal variation in the mantle, or that variations in mantle composition may compensate for thermal variations.<br>
<br>
"We're still far from satisfied that we have all the answers," Glatzmaier said. "The model is a way of exploring the unknown, and it looks very promising because the results are so much like the real magnetic field. But we have less confidence in the details, and that's where more powerful computers will help."

        <title>UC Board of Regents supports Proposition 26</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 14 Feb 2000 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>8601</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  By UC Office of the President<br>
  <br>
  The UC Board of Regents has adopted a resolution in support of Proposition 26 on California's March 7 ballot. The measure would allow voter approval of local school bond issues by a simple majority rather than the current two-thirds vote requirement.<br>
  <br>
  If passed, the proposition, known as the Majority Rule Act for Smaller Classes, Safer Schools and Financial Accountability, would affect local school districts, community college districts, and county education offices throughout California.<br>
  <br>
  "Because it would impact the capability of K-12 schools to fund improved teaching environments and foster higher student achievement, the act may ultimately enhance the preparedness of high-school students for enrollment and academic success at UC campuses," UC President Richard C. Atkinson said.<br>
  <br>
  California's K-12 public school enrollment is expected to increase by nearly one million students over the next decade, with approximately 63,000 of the additional students likely to attend UC campuses by 2010. To maintain state-mandated class-size reductions, this growth will require the construction of new schools and the hiring of new teachers as well as improvements for existing facilities to fulfill California's K-12 education goals.<br>
  <br>
  The CSU Board of Trustees also has voted to support the proposition. The initiative has been endorsed by the California Teachers Association, the California Chamber of Commerce, and the California School Boards Association, among others. Proposition 26 is opposed by "Save Our Homes," a group formed by the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Organization, which argues that the two-thirds standard protects property owners who are responsible for repaying any school bonds that are approved by the voters.<br>
  <br>
  Nationwide, 38 states allow majority approval of school bonds, while only California and New Hampshire require a two-thirds vote for local school bonds.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  The sixth annual Convocation on Teaching will provide another venue for discussion of the Narrative Evaluation System (NES) prior to the winter-quarter meeting of the Academic Senate. The convocation will take place Monday, February 14, from 3:30 to 5:30 p.m. in Classroom Unit 2. The convocation, cosponsored by the <a href="http://catsic.ucsc.edu/CTE">Center for Teaching Excellence</a> and the <a href="http://senate.ucsc.edu/">Academic Senate's</a> Committee on Teaching, will explore the subject: "NES and Pedagogy: Are Narrative Evaluations Important to Teaching and Learning at UCSC?" Panelists who reflect the range of opinions on campus will give short presentations, which will be followed by a general discussion open to everyone attending. Panelists will include Carolyn Dean, associate professor of art history; Daniel Guevara, associate professor of philosophy; Barbara Rogoff, professor of psychology; Anthony Tromba, professor of mathematics; and Juan Caballero, undergraduate student, Cowell College. The convocation will focus on the pedagogical aspects of the NES and will be a forum to answer the question: What, if anything, would a proposed change in the Narrative Evaluation System imply about the quality of teaching and learning in UCSC classrooms? Faculty, graduate and undergraduate students, and other interested people are invited to attend and join in the discussion.

  Kitty Klaidman The Past Purged: Hidden Memories of the Holocaust
</h3>
<p>
  UCSC Porter College Hall Gallery<br>
  Through February 27<br>

  Kitty Klaidman has been exhibiting her work since the mid-1960s in New York, London, Paris, Los Angeles, Washington, and other cities in Europe and the U.S. She currently has work in a traveling exhibition called "Witness and Legacy," which is touring museums throughout the country. Much of her work has been concerned with depicting physical fragments that prod us to remember the best and the worst of our history and culture. The UCSC exhibit draws on Klaidman's own history as a child in wartime Czechoslovakia, when she and her family were forced to hide in a dark, confined space for a year, but from which they emerged alive thanks to courageous Slovak farmers who hid them at the risk of their own lives. A later group of paintings in this exhibition commemorates the American dead at Normandy.

<h3>
  "The Golden Bird"
</h3>
<p>
  Presented by A Traveling Jewish Theater<br>
  Wednesday, February 16th, 7:30 p.m., UCSC Barn Theater<br>
  Tickets Available at the UCSC Ticket Office, ext. 9-2159<br>
  $10 general/$5 students and seniors<br>
  <br>
  "The Golden Bird," an original work created by the 1999 ATJT Apprentice Program, is inspired by a tale from the legendary mystic Rabbi Nachman of Bratslav. The Golden Bird combines old world wisdom, a contemporary search for meaning and identity, and a dash of Alice in Wonderland surrealism on a journey of self-discovery.<br>
  <br>
  The myth upon which the Golden Bird is based features the legendary Chasidic Master, Rebbe Nachman of Bratslav (1772-1810). Rebbe Nachman reportedly took long walks in the woods of Bratslav in an effort to draw closer to God. In the fable he hears the majestic song of a bird which captivates him and draws him deeper into the forest. Nachman believed that the bird's song was so sweet it had the power to bring peace to the entire world.<br>
  <br>
  In "The Golden Bird," Julia Nachman Burwitz, the daughter of a wealthy timber industrialist, gets lost in the woods of Humboldt County. She glimpses a beautiful golden bird flying over the forest and is transported on a quest to find it and the peace it promises. The journey of discovery leads her to faraway places and encounters with magical characters. Ultimately, Julia realizes that the bird's message is about everyone's responsibility to make the world a more peaceful place--and for Julia, this means taking responsibility for the environment.

        <title>Breaking down the barriers that keep Asian Americans out of teaching</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 14 Feb 2000 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>8598</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_8597" align="alignright" width="180"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/02/gordon_june.00-02-14.180.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-8597" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/02/gordon_june.00-02-14.180.jpg" alt="June Gordon Photo: Don Harris" width="180" height="237" /></a>June Gordon Photo: Don Harris[/caption]
<p>
  In a city like San Jose, where a large percentage of residents are Southeast Asian, the dearth of Asian teachers is glaring. Nationwide, only 2 percent of K-12 teachers are Asian, and for June Gordon, an assistant professor of education, those numbers are a call to action. Much of her research focuses on why students of color do not go into the teaching profession--and what can be done to change that.
</p>As part of a recent research project, Gordon and a team of UCSC undergraduates have identified four major factors that contribute to the scarcity of Asian American teachers. Gordon will present those findings in a paper called "Asian American Resistance to Selecting Teaching as a Career: The Power of Community and Tradition," during the Sociology of Education conference at Asilomar on February 26. (The paper is also being published this year by <i>Teachers College Record.)</i><br>
<br>
Parental pressure is a major factor in the decision not to go into teaching, found Gordon, but other considerations include feelings of personal inadequacy when measured against traditional Chinese expectations of what it takes to be a teacher, and a fear of working outside one's "comfort zone." A further finding revealed that Asian Americans tend not to see Asian teachers as necessary for their academic success or social adjustment in schools. But Gordon contends that Asian American participation is essential for a balanced, informed teaching force.<br>
<br>
"Their presence is not only important for Asian American students but for all kids," said Gordon. "We have got to have multiple voices at the table."<br>
<br>
Gordon's paper represents the culmination of a two-stage research project in which undergraduates who have declared a minor in education first were interviewed about their own reluctance to teach. A subset of those students then conducted a total of 52 interviews with Asian Americans in several California communities, including San Francisco and Sacramento.<br>
<br>
For Gordon, who specializes in the needs of urban schools, the project brought together two interests: the challenge of building a multiracial teaching force, and the transformative power of university teaching.<br>
<br>
Gordon is author of the forthcoming book <i>The Color of Teaching,</i> to be published this year by Falmer Press. As a professor, she enjoys witnessing the changes her students undergo as they conduct interviews on critical issues that are relevant to their lives.<br>
<br>
"I call it transformative pedagogy because it changes lives," said Gordon. "I develop research questions to intervene and expose half-truths and misperceptions. Meaningful research stimulates dialogue, and that happened in this process."<br>
<br>
As they conducted interviews with community members, the nine undergraduate researchers "started to use their knowledge to educate their community, which had the effect of increasing their own commitment to teaching," said Gordon, who is unabashed about her goal of getting students "hooked" on teaching in urban schools. "They saw themselves as scholars, as experts."<br>
<br>
Since the study began, all of the student researchers have entered graduate education programs or are working in an educational setting, said Gordon.<br>
<br>
The research itself illuminated the pivotal influences that undermine the confidence and interest of young Asian Americans who are considering going into teaching. Gordon recognizes the tremendous diversity among Asian cultures regarding language, religion, ethnicity, and socioeconomic class, but the themes that emerged in her study continued to be placed by the informants, regardless of ethnicity, in the context of traditional Chinese belief structures, she said.<br>
<br>
Pressure from parents who want their children to pursue higher status professions that pay more money is a daunting challenge faced by aspiring Asian American teachers, said Gordon. Although teaching is held in high regard throughout Asia, immigrants to the United States quickly learn that here professional status is equated with money, and parents often discourage their children from becoming teachers.<br>
<br>
Feelings of personal inadequacy are also rooted in the culture of China, where to become a teacher is "to be near perfection," explained Gordon, who earned her B.A. in East Asian studies at Stanford. "In this country, it's the opposite. We sum it up with that old saying, 'Those who can't do, teach,'" said Gordon. "But in Asia, you have to be extraordinary to become a teacher, and these abilities must be demonstrated prior to entering the profession, in contrast to America, where the classroom is often perceived as a crucial learning ground. From these notions, you can see how Asian Americans might be reticent to choose teaching as a career for fear of being accused of hubris."<br>
<br>
Cultural differences appear also to account for the strong fear of working outside one's "comfort zone," which Gordon explained as the realm of culture and values, including language, in which one feels at ease.<br>
<br>
"Asian Americans we interviewed say they would be willing to teach others 'who think like me,' and by that they mean people who share their respect for teachers, for hierarchy, and for structure," said Gordon. "But others have similar reservations, and yet still go into teaching. Those fears don't stop many middle-class white women, who make up the majority of the teaching force. Clearly, it's a combination of factors, and some Asian traditions contribute to the aversion."<br>
<br>
The fears may be aggravated by the need to "save face" that is common in Asian culture, added Gordon. "In any school, you have to be able to be challenged, to be laughed at," she said. "This is not easy for many Asian Americans who have been raised in traditional households."<br>
<br>
Those interviewed expressed little need to have their children taught by Asian American teachers, which Gordon attributed to the desire of many Asian Americans for their children to acquire the tools of access as quickly as possible. The first step towards access is language. To illustrate her point, she noted that even though she speaks Japanese and Chinese, English speakers would probably want to learn those languages from a native speaker rather than from her. Immigrants tend to be similarly biased in favor of native English speakers, she said.<br>
<br>
Despite these views, most respondents felt it would be valuable to have Asian American teachers for newly arrived immigrants to assist in the transition to a new country and language, added Gordon, who is committed to increasing the diversity of educators in schools.<br>
<br>
"This project helped reveal some of the biases my students were up against, and as a result, several of them overcame their own resistance to teaching," she said with satisfaction. "That's a positive step."

  Last updated on February 11, 2000
</p>

<p>
  In order to inform members of the UCSC community of the impacts of construction on campus, <i>Currents</i> is now posting monthly updates on any construction projects that affect transportation and parking. In addition, this update includes information on the Mission Street widening project, due to start in March.
</p>

<h3>
  Interdisciplinary Sciences Building
</h3>

<p>
  Expect traffic delays on <b>Steinhart Way</b>, the service road to the Science Library, Earth and Marine Sciences, and Natural Sciences 2. The loading dock to Natural Sciences 2 will be closed. Pedestrian paths will be rerouted along the construction site, and the pedestrian bridge to the Cowell Health Center will be closed. Construction will continue through fall 2001.
</p>

<h3>
  Core West Parking Structure
</h3>

<p>
  Materials and concrete delivery trucks will travel up <b>Heller Drive</b>, turn right onto <b>McLaughlin Drive</b>, and right onto <b>Steinhart Way</b>. Expect traffic delays on these roads in the project area probably through the summer.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Parking Lot 114</b> in front of Thimann Labs and across from the parking structure is available only to cars with A and B parking permits. Parking permits are enforced 24 hours every day.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Parking Lots 112 and 113</b> by Sinsheimer Labs and McLaughlin Drive are permanently closed.<br>
  <br>
  In order to compensate for these lost parking spaces, the <b>North Remote Parking Lot</b> is now reserved for cars with A and B parking permits and is no longer available for remote parking permits. <b>New shuttle service</b> between the North Remote Parking Lot and Science Hill is now offered. The Day East Remote Core route serves these areas every 15 minutes between 7:30 a.m. and 6 p.m. weekdays. The Express Night Core route provides drop-off service to the North Remote Lot weeknights after 6 p.m. <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/taps/maps.html">New maps and schedules</a> are available at the TAPS Web site.
</p>

<h3>
  Bay Tree Bookstore expansion and Graduate Commons
</h3>

<p>
  There will be occasional traffic delays due to construction vehicles in the immediate area. Expect construction noise. The short section of <b>Hagar Drive</b> between Steinhart Way and McLaughlin Drive continues to be a one-way street. This project will continue through summer 2000.
</p>

<h3>
  College Nine Apartments
</h3>

<p>
  <b>Parking Lot 164</b> across from the Village and close to Social Sciences 2 is available only to cars with A and B parking permits. Parking permits are enforced 24 hours every day.
</p>

<h3>
  Mission Street Widening
</h3>

<p>
  The first major stage of construction on <b>Mission Street from Chestnut Street to Otis Street and possibly to Rigg Street</b> is slated to begin in March and continue through October. Northbound underground work, consisting of drainage, water, and sewer work, will occur through July.<br>
  <br>
  The city of Santa Cruz has opened a public information center to answer questions, troubleshoot problems, and provide general information, assistance, and referrals. For more information about the project and to get up-to-date 24-hour information, visit the <a href="http://www.missionwidening.com">Mission Street Widening Project Web site</a> or call (831) 420-6242. Opinions, concerns, and questions can be e-mailed to mspac@cruzio.com.<br>
  <br>
  To obtain information regarding bus schedules and disruptions at planned bus stops, please call the Santa Cruz Metropolitan Transit District at (831) 425-8600.

        <title>UC announces plans for holiday to commemorate Veterans Day</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  UC Office of the President The University of California will honor the service and sacrifice of the nation's war veterans by designating Veterans Day, Nov. 11, as one of its official holidays beginning this year, President Richard C. Atkinson announced in early February. "California's veterans have contributed immeasurably to the welfare of the state and the nation," Atkinson said. "As president of the University of California and as a veteran, I am doubly pleased that UC will honor their service and their sacrifice by observing Veterans Day as an official university holiday." In years where Nov. 11 falls on a Saturday, the preceding Friday will be observed by faculty and staff. If the date falls on a Sunday, the holiday will be observed on the following Monday. This practice corresponds with the dates set for observing Veterans Day in California's public schools. Veterans Day honors those who served with the U.S. armed forces in times of war. First known as Armistice Day, the date marked the anniversary of the 1918 peace treaty signed on the 11th hour of Nov. 11 (the 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month) to end World War I. Through a Congressional resolution, it became a national holiday in 1938. In 1954, in recognition of the role played by veterans of WW II and Korea in defending peace, President Eisenhower signed a bill proclaiming Nov. 11 as Veterans Day to honor all the men and women who have served in war. There are 25 million veterans living today, according to the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. University holidays currently include New Year's Day, Martin Luther King, Jr., Day, President's Day, Memorial Day, Independence Day, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and a winter (late December) and a spring administrative holiday.
</p>

<p>
  University holidays are among the terms and conditions of employment governed by collective bargaining agreements for unionized employees; therefore, the university has proposed to those unions that Veterans Day be observed.<br>

<p>
  For many workers, the volatility of the "new economy" means less job security, shortened career paths, and lower wages. To see how workers are faring, UCSC economist Manuel Pastor is collaborating on a new project with Working Partnerships USA to assess the career-building services offered by organizations such as temporary employment agencies, labor unions, community colleges, and community-based organizations.
</p>One of the biggest changes ushered in by the "new economy" is the rise in temporary employment. An estimated 40 percent of Silicon Valley employees are temporary, contract, or subcontract employees. Employers have benefited from this dramatic increase, which offers companies unparalleled flexibility and considerable cost savings. But today's new employment picture leaves most workers unable to anticipate long-term employment with their current employer. To whom do they turn when they seek advancement opportunities or new skills?<br>
<br>
The answer, increasingly, is what economists call "labor intermediaries," such as for-profit employment agencies, educational institutions, and local initiatives like training centers. These organizations are left trying to fill the gap in services experienced by many workers in today's less-stable employment environment.<br>
<br>
But how widespread are these new labor intermediaries, and how good a job are they doing? Do workers know about these options? Do disadvantaged workers, those with the fewest skills and lowest pay, benefit?<br>
<br>
To answer these questions and others, Pastor is teaming up with San Jose-based <a href="http://www.atwork.org/wp/index.html">Working Partnerships USA</a>, a labor-supported think tank that conducts research on the changing economy and develops strategies to improve people's working conditions.<br>
<br>
"Working Partnerships represents a cutting-edge progressive response to the challenges of inequality and insecurity faced by many workers in Silicon Valley," said Pastor. "It is connected with what may be one of the most dynamic and forward-looking labor councils in the country."<br>
<br>
Because the organization "takes both research and policy seriously, it has been able to assemble a first-rate research team that is capable of producing results that will be of use to those promoting the interests of working people in Silicon Valley," said Pastor.<br>
<br>
The two-year study, which got under way last month, will examine labor intermediaries in Silicon Valley, considered by many the heart of the "new economy," and metropolitan Milwaukee, a rust-belt area that reflects the "old" economy of manufacturing.<br>
<br>
"No one has ever looked at the effects of labor intermediaries," said John Leopold, associate director of Working Partnerships USA. "Given the volatility of the new economy, we know workers are using intermediaries more than ever. We want to see what's out there and how they're doing, in both the 'new' and 'old' economy. We want to identify the organizations that do the best job of helping workers find good jobs that pay well and offer opportunities for advancement, particularly to disadvantaged workers."<br>
<br>
Pastor, a professor of Latin American and Latino studies, is an economic development specialist who was selected for the project because of his strong background in community development, said Leopold.
<p>
  Pastor has been an outspoken advocate for the Latino residents of Los Angeles, where he was a central participant in postriot recovery efforts. His report, "Latinos and the Los Angeles Uprising: The Economic Context," offered an analysis of the underlying socioeconomic challenges facing Latinos in L.A. and contributed to the emergence of a common policy agenda.
</p>
<p>
  Another project--a study of the distribution of toxics storage facilities that uncovered systematic environmental racism in Los Angeles--prompted the city council to establish an environmental justice task force after the findings appeared in the <i>Los Angeles Times.</i><br>
  <br>
  "Professor Pastor brings both excellent credentials and a commitment to social change to the job," said Leopold. Pastor will oversee the methodology of the study, including the design and administration of the survey, data processing, and writing of results.<br>
  <br>
  The first step of the new project involves profiling organizations within four broad categories: temporary agencies, unions, community colleges, and community-based organizations. The second phase entails surveying workers to gauge the effectiveness of each intermediary. Results will be used to shape policy recommendations, said Leopold.<br>
  <br>
  Established in 1995, Working Partnerships USA is a nonprofit organization dedicated to the development of employment policies that benefit working families. This study, which is being funded by grants from the Russell Sage Foundation and the Rockefeller Foundation, is an example of the innovative research Working Partnerships USA is pursuing in an effort to develop systemic reforms that will relieve the economic problems confronting working families. Contributing to the transformation of the workplace are intensified global competition, new information technology, and corporate restructuring, said Leopold.<br>
  <br>
  "The rise in temporary employment is resulting in lower wages and benefits and more job insecurity for everyone," said Leopold, noting that only a minority of the most highly skilled individuals find that these flexible employment patterns make it easier to balance work and family responsibilities.<br>
  <br>
  "The majority of Silicon Valley residents are now very vulnerable to rapid economic changes, they have little access to benefits and health care, and their opportunities for advancement are limited," said Leopold. "Twenty years ago, temporary agencies played a very small role, but now Manpower is the largest employer in the country."<br>
  <br>
  Among the public-policy reforms Working Partnerships USA is advocating are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Decrease the disparity in wages between permanent and contingent workers by passing civil rights legislation to ensure that contingent workers are paid the same wages as permanent workers who perform the same work;<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Increase access to health coverage, ideally through a system in which people have access to health coverage by virtue of being residents, not through their employment;<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Increase access to pensions through various tax strategies to promote pension portability, and adopt measures that allow workers to carry pension credits with them from job to job;<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Increase access to unemployment insurance. In many states, benefits are denied to independent contractors, temporary, part-time, and seasonal workers.
  </li>
</ul>

  As chair of the National Science Board's Committee on Communication and Outreach, Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood played a leading role in a recent symposium on "Communicating Science and Technology in the Public Interest." Leaders of public affairs, news media, and information technology organizations shared their views at the symposium, organized by the National Science Board and held at the Beckman Center in Irvine on February 2 and 3. The symposium generated a serious discussion on the current environment for science and engineering communications; public attitudes and the role of the media; the impact of new information technologies; and effective science and engineering communication and outreach practices. The discussions will help shape the future direction of <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/nsb/start.htm">National Science Board</a> and National Science Foundation activities in communicating science, engineering, and technology. The National Science Board is the governing body for the National Science Foundation and also serves as national science policy adviser to the President and the Congress.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  The sixth annual Convocation on Teaching will provide another venue for discussion of the Narrative Evaluation System (NES) prior to the winter-quarter meeting of the Academic Senate. The convocation will take place Monday, February 14, from 3:30 to 5:30 p.m. in Classroom Unit 2. The convocation, cosponsored by the <a href="http://catsic.ucsc.edu/CTE">Center for Teaching Excellence</a> and the <a href="http://senate.ucsc.edu/">Academic Senate's</a> Committee on Teaching, will explore the subject: "NES and Pedagogy: Are Narrative Evaluations Important to Teaching and Learning at UCSC?" Panelists who reflect the range of opinions on campus will give short presentations, which will be followed by a general discussion open to everyone attending. Panelists will include Carolyn Dean, associate professor of art history; Daniel Guevara, associate professor of philosophy; Barbara Rogoff, professor of psychology; Anthony Tromba, professor of mathematics; and Juan Caballero, undergraduate student, Cowell College. The convocation will focus on the pedagogical aspects of the NES and will be a forum to answer the question: What, if anything, would a proposed change in the Narrative Evaluation System imply about the quality of teaching and learning in UCSC classrooms? Faculty, graduate and undergraduate students, and other interested people are invited to attend and join in the discussion.

  Fitchen came up with a plan to take students to Nimes, France, for a quarter, where they would live with host families and study with a faculty sponsor. Professor of literature and women's studies Helene Moglen, who was dean of humanities at the time, liked the idea and funded it.<br>
  <br>
  Twenty-one years later the <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/people/gweltaz/fr.progr/index.html#nimes">French Quarter Abroad</a> program is thriving. Some 400 students have traveled to Nimes through the program, and another successful campus program that takes students to Morelia, Mexico, is modeled after the one in Nimes.<br>
  <br>
  "I'm delighted we've been able to keep this program going," says Fitchen. "The difference it makes to our students is remarkable--it transforms their lives. Professionally, it opens their eyes to opportunities and interests that would not have occurred to them otherwise, and personally, well, there's nothing like living abroad at that time of your life."<br>
  <br>
  Last spring, to mark the 20th anniversary of the program, the town of Nimes honored UCSC participants with a ceremony, presenting medals to the students and Fitchen. "It was really wonderful," she recalls. "All of the host families turned out, including two who had been hosting students since the program began."<br>
  <br>
  There are myriad opportunities for UCSC students to study abroad through the universitywide Education Abroad Program (EAP), and, indeed, some 250 to 300 UCSC students do so each year. But the Nimes and Morelia programs are unique because they are operated and funded by UCSC.
</p>

<p>
  Also unique is the structure of the program, which houses students with local families and provides instruction through a UCSC faculty member. All of UCSC's French lecturers--Fitchen, Miriam Ellis, Herve Le Mansec, Gildas Hamel, and David Orlando--have taken on this role over the past two decades. This spring, Hamel will lead the program.<br>
  <br>
  After two days in Paris, during which they will attend a performance of <i>Carmen;</i> at the new Opera de la Bastille, Hamel says the students will travel to Nimes, a town about the size of Santa Cruz. Students will have lessons each weekday morning with Hamel and use the afternoons for studying and excursions.<br>
  <br>
  Because Nimes is not a tourist town and because students spend their evenings with their host families, Hamel says, "They learn how to manage different social situations very quickly, something they can't really learn here. There are certain keys to use and once they've mastered them, no one recognizes that they are American. That's very exciting for them to discover and it motivates them to learn more and find other keys."<br>
  <br>
  Also exciting, says Hamel, is that moment when students begin using the language instinctively. "Almost immediately you have students coming in great excitement because they dreamt in French the night before."<br>
  <br>
  Charity Johnston, now a sophomore, participated in last year's program. "Academically, I took a huge leap, especially in conversational French because you're forced to use it all the time," she says. Johnston lives in Maison Francophone, a residential house on campus in which everyone speaks French, and she hopes to go back to France next year through EAP.<br>
  <br>
  "On a personal level, I think I really grew in just being able to learn how to adapt to a different culture. The family I lived with was very exceptional. They were very warm and very traditional. Meals were very important. I definitely gained weight while I was there."<br>
  <br>
  Along with weight, students gain language skills, cultural awareness, and lasting friendships. In fact, in a couple of cases, Fitchen says, they have gained even more. "People stay in touch. The relationships that have developed have been incredible. We have families visiting back and forth and we've even had cross-cultural marriages occur."

        <title>Survey ranks UCSC number one in astrophysics research</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 07 Feb 2000 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  In the field of astrophysics, UCSC leads the pack in terms of the impact of its researchers on the field, according to an independent national science group. The group ranked UCSC number one in astrophysics among the top 100 federally funded U.S. universities. The Institute for Scientific Information (ISI), based in Philadelphia, ranked the universities whose research papers attracted the most attention from other scholars in each of 24 fields between 1994 and 1998. The results for astrophysics were recently published on <a href="http://www.isinet.com/hot/research/19990830/b.html">ISI's Web site</a>. ISI's rankings are based on an analysis of scholarly citations. When researchers publish a journal article, they must cite previous papers by other authors that set the stage for their work. Generally, a paper garners more citations when scientists accept the work as important and well done. ISI analysts consider the average number of citations per paper, or the "citation impact," as the most objective way to gauge the quality of a department's or an institution's research. "This is an interesting ranking in that it's a measure of the impact of published research on the field--not how many papers you've published, but how often other scientists refer to your papers," said Joseph Miller, director of <a href="http://www.ucolick.org/">UC Observatories/Lick Observatory</a>. ISI previously ranked UCSC's astrophysicists second in citation impact for the period 1993 to 1997. In the latest rankings, UCSC has displaced Princeton University from the top slot. Other notable institutions that trail UCSC in the latest rankings include Yale University, UC Berkeley, Stanford University, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. UCSC's faculty includes leading researchers on both the observational and theoretical sides of astronomy and astrophysics. Research areas in which UCSC is especially strong include the study of galaxies; cosmology, which is concerned with the structure and evolution of the universe; the formation of stars and planets, including the discovery of planets outside the solar system; and high-energy phenomena such as supernovae and gamma ray bursts. "We have been doing good research in some very exciting areas, so it's not too surprising that we're getting this recognition," said Stanford Woosley, professor and chair of <a href="http://www.ucolick.org/~board/index.html">astronomy and astrophysics at UCSC</a>. UCSC astronomers are also involved in the design and construction of major telescopes and other instruments, Woosley noted. UCSC astronomers have been integrally involved in the design, construction, and use of the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii since the project's inception. The observatory houses the world's largest optical and infrared telescopes, the twin Keck I and Keck II Telescopes. UCSC astronomers are also among the leading users of the Hubble Space Telescope. Headquartered on the UCSC campus is UC Observatories/Lick Observatory, the multicampus research unit that oversees the Lick Observatory on Mount Hamilton and UC's involvement in the Keck Observatory. The Lick Observatory, established in 1888, continues to be a major astronomical research facility and is heavily used by UCSC astronomers.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  Two campus forums in January on the Narrative Evaluation System underscored the variety of opinions that are held about the manner in which the work of UCSC students should be assessed. More views are expected to be aired between now and the annual Convocation on Teaching, the final venue for discussion of the Narrative Evaluation System (NES) prior to the winter-quarter meeting of the Academic Senate. The convocation, scheduled for February 14, will explore the subject: "NES and Pedagogy: Are Narrative Evaluations Important to Teaching and Learning at UCSC?" The convocation will take place from 3:30 to 5:30 p.m. in Classroom Unit 2. In addition, students and faculty are invited to discuss the NES's future at Student Affairs' Winter 2000 Campus Leadership Retreat on Thursday, February 3, from 4:45 to 8 p.m. in the Merrill Dining Hall. Those interested in attending are asked to <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/sadiv/clr">RSVP</a>. At the February 23 meeting of the <a href="http://senate.ucsc.edu/">Academic Senate</a>, the senate's Committee on Educational Policy (CEP) is expected to propose that faculty "divide" the two questions before them: Should the campus adopt UC's conventional grading system, and what should become of the NES? The senate meeting is scheduled to take place at 3 p.m. in Theater Arts, Second Stage. Speaking at the second forum, on January 24, CEP chair George Brown said his committee is inclined to recommend that the senate proceed with an "up or down" vote on February 23 on a proposal that seeks to make grades mandatory--before tackling the issue of leaving the NES unchanged, modifying it, or doing away with it. To date, the forums have produced a handful of proposals--and considerable dialogue. <a href="http://senate.ucsc.edu/NEdiscus/proprose.html">One proposal</a>, put forward by physicist Bruce Rosenblum, would implement UC's traditional letter-grade system while making narratives a nontranscript option that is provided students at the discretion of each class's instructor. <a href="http://senate.ucsc.edu/NEdiscus/propbrog.html">A second</a>, proposed by psychologist Barbara Rogoff, would retain the spirit of the NES, but replace narratives with performance evaluations--a change that Rogoff said would "simplify the process of writing and reporting evaluations" and give faculty and students a better idea of the areas of assessment. A third, by Professor Emeritus Stanley Williamson of chemistry, would provide narratives only to undergraduates earning a "class ranking equivalent to a classical grade of 'B' or 'A,'" thus preserving the value of narratives but reducing the workload. "I am unclear as to whether the proponents of the demise of the NES are speaking more due to their perception of uselessness in transmitting valuable information to the student or to others. . . or to their desire to reduce their workload," Williamson said. Computer scientist Allen Van Gelder, offering <a href="http://senate.ucsc.edu/NEdiscus/propavg.html">a fourth idea</a>, said UCSC should adopt the standard UC grading policy and support a modified narratives system. Under Van Gelder's plan, instructors would determine whether to "enter" a narrative--but even blank evaluations would be returned to students to confirm that the process is completed. In Van Gelder's system, narratives would be internal only, "for the students' own information." Computer sciences student James Sheldon also weighed in with a proposal, saying that the assessment system should be expanded by requiring students to participate by "completing a self-evaluation." Sheldon also called for reduced class sizes, adding that narratives have "decreasing value in large introductory classes." The forums, retreat, and convocation were scheduled to solicit input and stimulate discussion on the Narrative Evaluation System in the wake of a December meeting of the Academic Senate called to consider replacing the NES with the conventional UC grading system. That meeting was prompted by a petition signed by more than 170 members of the senate. By a one-vote margin, the senate in December voted to move the matter to its CEP and Graduate Council for consideration. Rosenblum's proposal to make narratives optional reflects a belief held by a number of UCSC faculty that the NES is making it more difficult for the campus to attract and retain students with strong academic records and to communicate the quality of UCSC students to graduate and professional schools and prospective employers. "I know companies that will not consider UCSC students" who present them with narratives as their transcripts, Rosenblum said, adding that people outside UCSC see the NES as a "pass-fail system" that does not promote serious scholarship. The NES, Rosenblum also concluded, "is largely responsible for the campus's laid-back image." Rogoff, on the other hand, noted that grades have only been an option in all UCSC classes for two years--making it premature to change to a system of mandatory grades. "We should closely examine the optional GPA system in three years when we will have data to determine whether there is a problem that needs solving." She does, however, favor a change that makes narratives more like performance evaluations. "Some faculty regard a good NE to be like a long, personal letter of recommendation. . . . We should revise the norm to respect a template-based brief evaluation that contextualizes the dimensions of students' performance," Rogoff said. Many of the speakers at the first two forums echoed Rogoff's belief that an assessment system that provides more information than a grade has educational value--and in the process, may actually attract students to UCSC.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  The MESA Engineering Program at UCSC has received a grant of $8,000 from Pacific Bell as part of an effort by MESA and Pacific Bell to bridge the "digital divide." The partnership is assisting educationally disadvantaged students to attain engineering and computer science degrees. The grant, designed to help further develop the MESA Engineering Program's board and to improve the academic advising within the program, is one of several grants from Pacific Bell to MESA programs throughout California. <a href="http://natsci.ucsc.edu/Acad/Mesa/Main/main.htm">MESA</a>, which stands for Mathematics, Engineering, Science Achievement, is a statewide program administered by UC that assists more than 22,000 educationally disadvantaged students to succeed academically in math and science. "Working with MESA is a form of enlightened self-interest," said David Morse, vice president of Pacific Bell's Billing Products Organization. "The MESA Engineering Program is a richly producing educational model designed to meet the special requirements of disadvantaged students who want to excel in the math- or science-based fields. These students will make great customers and great employees for Pacific Bell. It's a win-win situation for all involved," Morse said. The MESA Engineering Program is a partnership between MESA and four-year institutions including campuses of the University of California and the California State University, as well as private universities. The program supports students at these institutions to successfully attain degrees in engineering or computer science.

        <title>Santa Cruz historian dishes up the dirt on the San Lorenzo River in UCSC talk</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  Santa Cruz historian Sandy Lydon will be the featured guest for the upcoming Cowell College Night. He will present a slide show and talk titled, "River's Child: A Water-Level History of Santa Cruz and her Mother of a River." The talk, free and open to the public, takes place on Monday, February 7, at 7:30 p.m. in UCSC's Cowell College Dining Hall.
</p>

<p>
  Lydon, a professor of history at Cabrillo College, has a longstanding personal history with the San Lorenzo River, having first set foot in it more than 50 years ago as a steelhead fisherman.<br>
  <br>
  The history surrounding the river is colorful and sometimes dramatic. According to Lydon, pioneers who came to Santa Cruz in its early days laughed at the city plan that had set the town of Santa Cruz in a floodplain. And, Lydon jokes, people are still laughing.
</p>

<p>
  Along with pondering the ramifications of the location of Santa Cruz, Lydon will also demonstrate how the river bottom was--and continues to be--the bottom rung on Santa Cruz's economic ladder: From Chinatown to the Homeless Shelter, Santa Cruz has always relegated its poorest citizens to the river bottom. Lydon will also clear up some of the mythology about the San Lorenzo, and speculate about the river's future.<br>
  <br>
  In conjunction with the talk, Lydon will lead a guided walk along the San Lorenzo on Sunday, February 13, from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m., rain or shine. Tickets for the walk are $3 and can be purchased at the Monay night lecture. Those who wish to participate in the walk are required to attend the lecture. A bag lunch is recommended for the walk.<br>
  <br>
  For more information, call (831) 459-2255.

        <title>Third annual Leadership Convocation will address growth issues</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 31 Jan 2000 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>

        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  For the past two years, some 200 campus managers and administrators have gathered for the annual Leadership Convocation. The purpose of the convocation is to address issues and policies of campuswide concern and to foster a common vision for UCSC. Presentations and discussions have focused on such subjects as use of resources, growth management, and goal development.<br>
  <br>
  This year, the group is poised to gather again when, on March 6, the third annual Leadership Convocation takes place. This year, according to convocation chair Catherine Faris, the gathering will address issues and goals identified in the previous two years. "The first two convocations were really focused on the fact that the campus is growing and changing and preparing for growth," says Faris, assistant vice chancellor for Business and Administrative Services. "I think it's fair to say that this year the campus no longer has the luxury to prepare for growth--it's here."<br>
  <br>
  As enrollments increase at UCSC (responding to the systemwide mandate for each campus to serve more students), the infrastructure must expand to accommodate the growing student body. Everything from staff and equipment increases to new construction must be considered.<br>
  <br>
  Faris says that the Leadership Convocation Administrative Council is committed this year to focusing on the cohort of managers who are responsible for supporting the expansion. "We will be identifying what managers need and how can they be supported in order to make the campus vision a reality," she says.<br>
  <br>
  "We haven't had this experience before and so we have to create a blueprint. There is no recognized formula in use at UC to tell us, for example, at what point you add a new police officer to the department, or when changing the way we provide services is more effective than adding staff."
</p>

<p>
  The convocation's administrative council is chaired by Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor John Simpson and includes Francisco Hernandez, vice chancellor of Student Affairs; Tom Vani, vice chancellor of Business and Administrative Services; Ron Suduiko, vice chancellor of University Relations; Julia Armstrong-Zwart, assistant academic vice chancellor of Faculty Relations and assistant chancellor of Human Resources; Assistant Chancellor Leslie Sunell; Meredith Michaels, associate vice chancellor of Planning and Budget; and Assistant Provost Beau Willis.

  Since its opening January 4, the new Fitness Center has quickly become one of the most popular facilities on campus. Boasting two floors of shiny new equipment, the center is a bright, airy place to realize your fitness goals. For the next few months, <i>Currents Online</i> will follow two members of the campus community with varied fitness backgrounds as they "just do it."
</p>New to campus, career adviser Katrina Cope began working in the Career Center last November. It didn't take her long to scope out the Fitness Center's free lunch-hour "Express Workout," a 40-minute weight-training circuit taught twice-weekly by center manager Ryan Andrews.<br>
<br>
"This appealed to me, doing a lunchtime workout," said Cope, as she and about seven others did their warm-up stretches with Andrews on a recent rainy day.<br>
<br>
Staying with a new fitness program is always a challenge, and Cope figures "going public" will help keep her on the straight and narrow. In the past, Cope has been an avid hiker, cyclist, and backpacker, but she found that having a child 11 years ago really cut into her time for exercising.<br>
<br>
"Having a child slows you way down," said Cope. "Between working full-time, having a child and a husband, it's been hard to fit exercise in."<br>
<br>
Inspired to get back in shape, Cope is realistic about her fitness program. It has to fit into her schedule without interfering with her family, she said.<br>
<br>
"I have to be able to incorporate it into my daily routine," she said, recalling past attempts to take aerobics classes that added time in the car traveling to and from classes, as well as the class time itself, into her already tight schedule.<br>
<br>
For Cope, who works in Hahn Student Services, the Fitness Center is about as convenient as it could be. She and a "fitness buddy" in her office walk over for the workout, and they have started taking lunch-hour walks on their "off" days.<br>
<br>
The drop-in class is fast-paced but fun.<br>
<br>
"It's not boring. That's why I never used a gym before, but Ryan is really encouraging," said Cope. "I think it's great to have a coach, and the group energy helps me."<br>
<br>
Andrews, who keeps a tight grip on his stop watch throughout the workout, is watchful and helpful, correcting posture and helping his students adjust the machines for the right fit and maximum benefit. At the end of the fourth session of the class, Andrews has a message for his students. Now, after two weeks of gentle workouts, he wants them to start pushing themselves.<br>
<br>
"Start making it so when you get to 40 seconds, you're tired," he said, referring to the 40-second intervals students spend on each machine. Forty seconds doesn't sound like much, but after two circuits, most students have broken a sweat, and all seem relieved by the prospect of cooldown stretches.<br>
<br>
Cope's goal is clear. "If I can do two days a week in the gym for the quarter, I'll be really happy," she said. "It'll be two days more than I've been exercising during the last two years."<br>
<br>
Unlike Cope, chemistry professor Eugene Switkes has played tennis regularly for 30 years and enjoys running, too. A few years ago, Switkes said he got the bug to expand his routine to include the weight room. Maybe it had something to do with his 52nd birthday, he grins. Now he tries to play tennis a couple of times a week and rounds out his fitness program with hour-long gym workouts three times a week.<br>
<br>
"I'm definitely not an ironman," Switkes said as sweat dripped off his brow during a stint on the rowing machine. "It's just a way to feel better."<br>
<br>
In fact, feeling better is what keeps him coming back for more. Sure, he said, it can be hard to get motivated, but it's the memory of how much better he feels after a workout that keeps him going. That, and pride.<br>
<br>
"If you look at the dials, I'm running all these machines on the 'fat burn' setting," said Switkes, grinning again.<br>
<br>
Switkes revels in the new surroundings, having worked out in the old weight room for years. "This is great," he said, admiring the center's equipment and the expansive views. "(OPERS Director) Dan Wood did a great job. We have him to thank for this--and the students, who voted for it and are getting a great return."<br>
<br>
Switkes admitted to having been intimidated at first by all the fancy electronic settings on the new cardiovascular machines. "I was born before the advent of the VCR, so I didn't know how to work the machines. It took all my Ph.D. smarts to figure them out," he joked. Now he sets each one for ten minutes and tries to burn about 140 calories per machine.<br>
<br>
But challenges remain, even for Switkes. Next, he plans to tackle the state-of-the-art computerized Technogym machines, which offer complete preprogrammed, customized workout information. Stay tuned.<br>
<br>
And don't be put off: Instructors are available to teach newcomers about the machines and how to maximize their workouts. In addition, the Fitness Center offers classes and equipment orientations to help get you started--and to keep you going.

The symposium features 38 speakers covering one of three areas: leadership, communication, and personal development. The three keynote speakers will be Chin-Ning Chu, author of <i>Do Less, Achieve More</i> and <i>Thick Face Black Heart;</i> Julianne Malveaux, syndicated columnist, economist, and author of <i>Sex, Lies and Stereotypes: Perspectives of a Mad Economist;</i> and Pat Heim, author of the widely read <i>Hardball for Women.</i> A highlight of the conference will be a panel of top-level UC women who will share insights on what it takes to become a leader within the UC system. Participants in the session, "Power, Performance, and Position: Strategies for Highly Effective Leadership," include Greenwood, UCLA Vice Chancellor Claudia Mitchell-Kernan, and UC Santa Barbara Vice Chancellor France Cordova. California Alumni Association President Irene Miura will act as moderator. Other UCSC participants include Julia Armstrong-Zwart, assistant chancellor for human resources, on "Leading with Soul: Developing an Authentic Leadership Style," and Robin Santos, acting director of the Equal Employment Opportunity/Affirmative Action Office, on "Lesbian, Bi, Transgendered, Questioning, and Straight Women: Strengthening Our Relationships in the Workplace." Registration is required to attend the symposium. The cost is $200 through January 14, $250 through March 3, and $300 on site. Additional information on registration and the symposium is available on the <a href="http://www.ucsf.edu/cge">Center for Gender Equity Web site</a> or by contacting Michelle Whitish at (415) 476-5222. The UCSF Center for Gender Equity programs include lectures; conferences focused on health, leadership, and public advocacy issues for women; crisis-intervention counseling for rape survivors; self-defense classes; support groups; and community outreach.

        <title>Applications top 20,000 for fall 2000 enrollment at UC Santa Cruz</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 31 Jan 2000 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>8568</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>
  New report shows that increased interest in the campus is coming from all ethnic groups
</h3>

<p>
  UC Santa Cruz has received more than 20,000 applications from prospective students for the fall 2000 quarter, the highest number received by the campus in its 36-year history. The total is nearly 13 percent more than the campus received during last year's application period--and more than three times the increase in applications experienced by the University of California system as a whole.
</p>The fall-quarter applications data is contained in a report released by UC's Office of the President on January 27, 2000.<br>
<br>
The report indicates that UCSC received 19,768 applications from prospective undergraduates (freshmen and transfer students) during the traditional November filing period. Since then, however, the campus has received an additional 400 applications, pushing the total received to date to 20,168 for fall 2000 enrollment.<br>
<br>
In the UC report, UCSC's application total of 19,768 is 12.7 percent higher than last year's total of 17,542; the one-year UC-wide increase is 3.5 percent.<br>
<br>
J. Michael Thompson, UCSC's associate vice chancellor for outreach, admissions, and student academic services, called the increase in UCSC applications "gratifying," adding that it "speaks to the quality of UCSC's faculty and programs, to the expansion of its academic offerings, and to the campus's increased success in telling the UCSC story to prospective students and their families."<br>
<br>
This is the third fall application cycle in which UC has operated without affirmative action policies. Thompson noted that UCSC increased the enrollment of underrepresented minorities on campus the first two falls and is on track to do so again in fall 2000.<br>
<br>
California freshman applications from African American students are up 20.6 percent at UCSC (3.6 percent systemwide); applications from American Indians are up 9.4 percent at UCSC (down 4.3 percent systemwide); applications from Asian Americans, who are underrepresented at UCSC, are up 17.8 percent on campus (up 2.6 percent systemwide); applications from Chicanos are up 23.5 percent at UCSC (up 6.3 percent systemwide); applications from Filipino Americans are up 12.9 percent at UCSC (up 2.3 percent systemwide); and applications from Latinos are up 8.2 percent at UCSC (6.4 percent systemwide).<br>
<br>
<br>
California freshman applications to UCSC from white students are up 5.5 percent, compared to a systemwide decline of 0.3 percent.<br>
<br>
"We are very pleased with the continued increase in the ethnic diversity of UCSC applicants," Thompson said. "UC Santa Cruz is proud of its role in providing access and opportunity to the future leaders of California."<br>
<br>
The campus also saw an 11.6 percent increase in applications from students at California community colleges, compared to a systemwide increase of 0.1 percent. The UCSC increase reflects the campus's desire to meet the enrollment targets set two years ago by the UC president and the chancellor of the state community college system. In a memo of understanding, they hoped to increase by 33 percent the number of community college students transferring to UC campuses by the year 2005.<br>
<br>
The campus's ongoing effort to make prospective students aware of the opportunities available to them at UCSC is a joint endeavor that involves the cooperation of faculty, staff, and, in particular, current students who are willing to share their experiences with high school seniors, noted Thompson. One of the most successful outreach programs administered by the Office of Admissions is "Taking UCSC Home," in which current UCSC students visit their old high schools to encourage students to consider attending UCSC. In its fourth year, the program has attracted new students to the campus who credit the university's "ambassadors" with helping them decide to enroll at UCSC, said Thompson.<br>
<br>
Despite growing interest in the campus, UCSC remains committed to managing its growth to comply with long-range development plans, said Thompson, noting that UCSC will be selective about the students it chooses to enroll. From the more than 20,000 applicants, the campus expects to enroll 3,700 freshmen and new transfer students this coming fall, Thompson projected.<br>
<br>
The next step in the undergraduate admissions cycle is to notify students of admission, which will take place on March 1. On April 15, the campus holds its annual open house, Banana Slug Spring Fair, which draws several thousand prospective students and their parents to campus. The deadline for students to notify the university of their plans to enroll as undergraduates in the fall is May 1.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  UC Office of the President The University of California enrolled 35,100 new undergraduate students this fall, the highest total ever and one likely to be exceeded by next year's class, to which a record 86,000 students have applied.
</p>Fall 1999 enrollment represents the fifth consecutive year of record numbers of new students entering the university. The trend is expected to continue as a major surge in California's college-age population, dubbed Tidal Wave II, boosts UC's enrollment by approximately 40 percent between now and 2010.<br>
<br>
"The bottom line is that Tidal Wave II is not coming, it is here," said UC President Richard C. Atkinson. "To meet this increasing demand, we are pursuing a variety of strategies aimed at providing educational opportunities for the top 12.5 percent of public high school graduates and maintaining high-quality education."<br>
<br>
To accommodate enrollment growth over the next decade, UC is considering a variety of options, including expanded summer instruction, regular fall-winter-spring enrollment growth, more off-campus opportunities, increased use of technology, and continued efforts to maximize students' ability to graduate in four years.<br>
<br>
UC also is pursuing development of a new campus at Merced, which is expected to enroll 5,000 students by 2010.<br>
<br>
This year's enrollment of all new students, freshmen and transfers, is 3.8 percent higher than last year. Freshman enrollment increased 4.4 percent, from 24,877 to 25,970. The number of upper-division transfer students rose 2 percent, from 8,959 to 9,139.<br>
<br>
All ethnic groups experienced an increase, except American Indian students. White students increased 17 percent, from 11,931 to 13,965; East Indian/Pakistani students increased 12.9 percent, from 827 to 934; Asian American students increased 10 percent, from 8,773 to 9,654; Latino students increased 9.4 percent, from 1,046 to 1,144; Chicano students increased 8.9 percent, from 3,034 to 3,304; Filipino American students increased 4.7 percent, from 1,527 to 1,599; and African American students increased 4.6 percent, from 958 to 1,001.<br>
<br>
The number of students from other ethnic groups increased from 572 to 747. The number of students from unknown groups declined from 4,912 to 2,540. American Indian students dropped from 256 to 245.
<p>
  <b>California freshman applications</b><br>
  <br>
  An increase in applications continues to reflect the great interest UC holds for the state's top high school students. This year, 54,146 California students applied for freshman admission in fall 2000, an increase of 2.5 percent over the 52,847 students who applied for fall 1999.<br>
  <br>
  Applications rose at all UC campuses, with Riverside (15.7 percent) and Santa Barbara (15 percent) recording the largest increases.<br>
  <br>
  California freshman applications rose in each ethnic category except American Indian and white/other. The largest increases were among Latinos 6.4 percent, from 1,819 to 1,936; and Chicanos 6.3 percent, from 5,530 to 5,878. There also were increases in applications from African Americans 3.6 percent, from 2,099 to 2,174; Asian Americans 2.6 percent, from 14,535 to 14,920; and Filipino Americans 2.3 percent, from 2,629 to 2,690. Applications from American Indians declined 4.3 percent, from 376 to 360. Applications from white/others remained relatively unchanged with a 0.3 percent decline, from 22,019 to 21,944.<br>
  <br>
  <b>California Community College transfer applications</b><br>
  <br>
  The number of upper-division California Community College students who applied to UC increased by 2.5 percent. Because upper-division students have 60 or more semester units and are better prepared for UC-level work, they are given priority in admission of transfer students. In addition, most of these students have applied to multiple UC campuses, further improving their chances of being admitted.<br>
  <br>
  As a result, UC may admit more California Community College students for fall 2000 despite having a relatively flat number of overall applications. Following a very large increase in California Community College applications last year, the overall number of students seeking to transfer remained essentially flat, with an increase from 13,698 to 13,710.<br>
  <br>
  It is likely those numbers will improve as several campuses continue to take applications from California Community College students over the next few weeks.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Gender</b><br>
  <br>
  The total applicant pool for fall 2000 is composed of 54.5 percent female and 45.5 percent male students, compared with 54.9 percent female and 45.1 percent male last year.

<p>
  The African American Theater Arts Troupe begins its ninth season with a production of <i>A Long Time Since Yesterday</i> by award-winning playwright P. J. Gibson.
</p>Gibson is the author of more than a dozen plays. <i>Long Time</i>, written in 1985, is the story of five sorority sisters who reunite 20 years after college at the suburban home of a classmate who has just committed suicide. The play addresses issues of race, sex, politics, and gender, using insight, humor, and song. The play contains adult language.<br>
<br>
Shows take place at UCSC's Second Stage at 8 p.m. on Friday, February 18th, and Saturday, February 19, and at 3 p.m. on Sunday, February 20. Performances will also take place at the Louden Nelson Community Center at 8 p.m. on Friday, February 25, and Saturday, February 26.<br>
<br>
The African American Theater Arts Troupe was established in 1991 with the purpose of fostering diversity on the campus and in the community. Each year, led by director Don Williams, the troupe of UCSC students performs works about people of color to the campus and the community.<br>
<br>
The troupe also provides scholarships to five UCSC students annually. Since it was formed, the African American Theater Arts Troupe has awarded more than $35,000 in scholarships. This year the troupe is aiming to raise $12,000 through performances and donations. Scholarships are awarded on the basis of merit and need, with priority given to troupe members and theater arts students.<br>
<br>
Tickets are $6 for students with ID; and $9 general. For tickets and more information, call (831) 459-2159.

Through her monthly <i>Essence</i> column, "In the Spirit," and her numerous public appearances, she has become an example and inspiration to the African American communities she promotes. She is the author of two best-selling books, <i>Lessons in Living,</i> and <i>In the Spirit,</i> a collection of her monthly columns.<br>
<br>
An advocate of African American entrepreneurship and a supporter of community-based organizations, Taylor is committed to working with disadvantaged women and young people to help them realize their strengths and take charge of their lives.<br>

  <font color="#003399">Fruit tree pruning workshop</font>
</h4>
<p>
  Fruit tree expert Orin Martin will offer you all the tips you need to prune your fruit trees successfully at a two-hour pruning workshop on Saturday, January 29, from 10 a.m. to noon. The class will be held at the Louise Cain Gatehouse on the Farm.<br>
  <br>
  <img align="right" border="0" height="128" src="../art/prune.175.jpg" width="175" alt="">Proper pruning will improve the health, appearance, and productivity of your fruit trees. Martin, who manages the Alan Chadwick Garden at UCSC, will cover numerous types of trees, including apple, pear, peach, and persimmon.<br>
  <br>
  Martin will give a talk and then demonstrate pruning techniques that are useful for backyard gardeners. He'll discuss pruning as part of the overall organic management of fruit trees and will field questions from participants. Key tips on the proper timing of pruning and how pruning can be used in tandem with other management techniques to fight disease will also be offered.<br>
  <br>
  The Louise Cain Gatehouse is located 1/4 mile up the gravel road above the Blacksmith Shop; free public parking is available across the street from the Blacksmith Shop in the Physical Plant parking lot.<br>
  <br>
  Fees for the workshop, which are payable the day of the class, are $10, or $5 for members of the Friends of the UCSC Farm & Garden. Participants are encouraged to wear warm clothes; heavy rain cancels the event. For more information, call (831) 459-3248.

<p>
  The remarkable legacy of the man behind such visionary programs as UC's Natural Reserve System and the federal Marine Mammal Protection Act is being celebrated through a special exhibition at the University of California, Santa Cruz, currently taking place in the campus's Science and McHenry Libraries.
</p>The exhibit, <a href="http://library.ucsc.edu/library/exhibits/">"Science Through an Artist's Eye: The Visionary World of Kenneth S. Norris,"</a> highlights some of the facets of the late UCSC professor's rich scientific and conservation legacy. The exhibit will be on display through April 1.<br>
<br>
A reception will take place on Friday, January 28, from 4 to 6 p.m. in the McHenry Library foyer. A special event is also planned in conjunction with the exhibition on Sunday, February 20, from 2 to 4 p.m. at the Santa Cruz Public Library when the library's "Science Matters" program will feature a panel discussion on a new oral-history biography of Norris.<br>
<br>
The biography is titled <i>Kenneth S. Norris: Naturalist, Cetologist & Conservationist, 1924-1998</i> and was released in 1999 by UCSC's Regional History Project.<br>
<br>
Norris (1924-1998), was an avid naturalist known for his passion for his work and for teaching. A professor of natural history at UCSC for 18 years, Norris retired in 1990. His extensive legacy includes the founding of UCSC's Long Marine Laboratory and the campus's Institute of Marine Sciences. For many years he also conducted the celebrated "Natural History Field Quarter" class, in which students traveled together across California with Norris and studied the state's diverse natural habitats. Norris also conducted extensive research for and helped author the federal Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972.<br>
<br>
Norris is also known as the scientist who verified the use of echolocation (or sonar) used by some marine mammals for navigation. William McFarland, professor emeritus of zoology at Cornell University and a longtime colleague, describes Norris's discovery of echolocation in the oral history.<br>
<br>
"What Ken discovered from watching and doing experiments with the porpoises in the tanks was that they scanned, and as they approached an object, the scanning would become more rapid. He thought that what they were doing was listening with each side to the echoes and sort of nulling it out, so to speak, to hone in on it at the end. The frequency went up as they got closer to an object. . . . So he built all of that. That was, to me, brilliant. . . . and it turned out to be just so controversial that people wouldn't believe him until Ted Bullock showed that that was indeed what was happening."<br>
<br>
Norris's discovery process combined patient observation, great intelligence, and keen intuition. In the same oral history, Norris explains to editor Randall Jarrell, "I have managed to get the reputation as somebody who sees things that other people don't see, but they don't know why. So, they all say, 'Well, let Norris play. He's usually right.' That been a true thing throughout . . . especially in the latter part of my career when some of the fetters come off your mind and you say, 'Oh damn it, I'm going to say this. I know it's right so I'm going to say it.' That's where my reputation as a scientist has come from. I have been right about a lot of things that people have been surprised at often, I think."<br>
<br>
It was also Norris who was behind the establishment of the Natural Reserve System--33 sites across the state administered by the University of California. According to Roger Samuelsen, former director of the Natural Reserve System (NRS) and senior associate to the chancellor at UC Merced, it was Norris who put together the blueprint for the whole program. Norris convinced the UC Regents to consider the idea of protecting natural areas for the purpose of preservation and field study, and, says Samuelsen, "he literally took an entire semester in the spring of 1966 and toured the state. . . . I've read how he borrowed a jeep and a dictating machine and was off and running." Norris visited nearly 100 sites and proposed an acquisition plan that ultimately led to the establishment of the NRS.<br>
<br>
The current exhibit features photographs, illustrations, books, field journal entries, and memorabilia. At McHenry Library, two upright cases are devoted to the "Natural History Field Quarter" class; other cases highlight Norris's teaching career, a collection of "Kenisms," his research in desert ecology and herpetology, and publications from the Environmental Field Studies Program. The exhibit at the Science Library highlights Norris's pioneering research on dolphins and whales, his confirmation of dolphin echolocation, and his role in the crafting of the Marine Mammal Protection Act.<br>

<p>
  For the 75 members of the campus community who attended the first of three campus forums on UCSC's Narrative Evaluation System last week, the discussion focused on two distinctly different proposals.
</p>One, put forward by physicist Bruce Rosenblum, would implement UC's traditional letter-grade system while making narratives a nontranscript option that is provided students at the discretion of each class's instructor.
<p>
  A second, proposed by psychologist Barbara Rogoff, would retain the spirit of the Narrative Evaluation System (NES), but replace narratives with performance evaluations--a change that Rogoff said would "simplify the process of writing and reporting evaluations" and give faculty and students a better idea of the areas of assessment.
</p>
<p>
  Rosenblum and Rogoff were joined on a panel at the forum by George Brown, chair of the Academic Senate's Committee on Educational Policy; Senate chair Roger Anderson; Loren Steck, past president of the Alumni Association and current trustee of the UC Santa Cruz Foundation; Graduate Council chair David Belanger; physicist Zack Schlesinger; and undergraduate Manuel Schwab.
</p>
<p>
  The vast majority of the faculty and student speakers at the Media Theater forum spoke in favor of retaining the NES or modifying it to reflect aspects of Rogoff's plan.
</p>
<p>
  The forum last week was the first of three planned to solicit campus input on the Narrative Evaluation System in the wake of a December meeting of the <a href="http://senate.ucsc.edu/">Academic Senate</a> called to consider replacing the NES with the conventional UC grading system. That meeting was prompted by a petition signed by more than 170 members of the senate.
</p>
<p>
  By a one-vote margin, the senate in December voted to move the matter to its CEP and Graduate Council for consideration. At the forum last week, Brown said his committee will make recommendations on the matter at the February 23 meeting of the senate.
</p>
<p>
  Rosenblum's proposal to make narratives optional reflects a belief held by a number of UCSC faculty that the NES is making it more difficult for the campus to attract and retain students with strong academic records and to communicate the quality of UCSC students to graduate and professional schools and prospective employers. "I know companies that will not consider UCSC students" who present them with narratives as their transcripts, Rosenblum said, adding that people outside UCSC see the NES as a "pass-fail system" that does not promote serious scholarship.
</p>
<p>
  The NES, Rosenblum also concluded, "is largely responsible for the campus's laid-back image."
</p>
<p>
  Rogoff, on the other hand, noted that grades have only been an option in all UCSC classes for two years--making it premature to change to a system of mandatory grades. "We should closely examine the optional GPA system in three years when we will have data to determine whether there is a problem that needs solving."
</p>
<p>
  She did, however, favor a change that makes narratives more like performance evaluations. "Some faculty regard a good NE to be like a long, personal letter of recommendation--we should revise the norm to respect a template-based brief evaluation that contextualizes the dimensions of students' performance," Rogoff said.
</p>
<p>
  Many of the speakers at the first forum echoed Rogoff's belief that an assessment system that provides more information than a grade has educational value--and, in the process, may actually attract students to UCSC.
</p>
<p>
  Computer engineer Kevin Karplus, meanwhile, wondered whether the increase in grades in recent years is "changing the culture" on campus. More students seem to be "interested in getting exam points" and incidents of plagiarism are up in his classes, he reported.
</p>
<p>
  Karplus also noted that at least one institution is reconsidering the value of an educational environment that places a reduced emphasis on grades. Faculty at Harvard Law School, he said, recently voted to do away with grades in their students' first year because "the students were getting too competitive."
</p>
<p>
  Members of the campus community may still attend two other forums on the NES. The second in the series takes place today (Monday, January 24) from 4 to 6 p.m. in Classroom Unit 2. In addition, the annual Convocation on Teaching, scheduled for Monday, February 14 (changed from Friday, February 11), will explore the subject: "NES and Pedagogy: Are Narrative Evaluations Important to Teaching and Learning at UCSC?" The convocation will take place from 3:30 to 5:30 p.m. in Classroom Unit 2.

        <title>Dean of Natural Sciences to deliver annual faculty research lecture</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 24 Jan 2000 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>

        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_8554" align="alignright" width="180"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/01/kliger.00-01-24.180.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-8554" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/01/kliger.00-01-24.180.jpg" alt="David Kliger" width="180" height="240" /></a>David Kliger[/caption]
<p>
  David Kliger, professor of chemistry and biochemistry and dean of the Division of Natural Sciences, began his research career studying the pigments in the eye that make it possible for animals to see and have color vision. He became a pioneer in the use of extremely fast laser pulses to study how molecules interact with light, and he now heads one of the top laboratories in the world in this field.
</p>In recognition of his outstanding research accomplishments, Kliger will present UCSC's 34th annual Faculty Research Lecture on Tuesday, February 15, at 8 p.m. in Room B-206 of the Earth and Marine Sciences Building. The title of his talk is "Making Light Work of Biology: Using Lasers to Understand Biomolecules." The talk is free and open to the public.<br>
<br>
Kliger joined the UCSC faculty in 1971 and has served as chair of his department, chair of the Academic Senate, and chair of the Committee on Academic Personnel. He was appointed dean of the Division of Natural Sciences in 1990. Despite his administrative duties, he has continued to maintain a very active research laboratory.<br>
<br>
Kliger's research career has straddled the boundaries of chemistry, physics, and biology. He has developed new ultrasensitive analytical techniques and has used them to study the chemical structures and functions of a variety of protein molecules.<br>
<br>
Fast laser spectroscopy was a new technique when Kliger began his research at UCSC, and he started applying it to his studies of visual pigment proteins. This tool enabled him to analyze the molecular changes that take place in visual pigments when they absorb light. His work has since expanded to include research on a variety of biologically important molecules, including hemoglobin (the pigment in red blood cells), myoglobin (the reddish pigment in muscle), and cytochrome c (an enzyme that aids in the use of oxygen).<br>
<br>
In his talk, Kliger will describe in simple terms the latest laser spectroscopy techniques, which measure changes in molecular structures on timescales as short as one-billionth of a second. He will explain how these techniques yield information about the functions of key molecules in important biological processes. As one example of the work he and his research group have done over the years, Kliger will discuss what such studies have revealed about how visual pigment proteins convert light signals entering the eye into electrical signals transmitted to the brain, resulting in vision.<br>
<br>
In selecting Kliger as the Faculty Research Lecturer for 1999-2000, the Academic Senate noted that the way proteins change their structure when they react to light and other forces is one of the most active areas of study in science today. "Professor Kliger is a leader in this new subfield, which tries to comprehend how living molecules work at their most basic level," wrote the senate committee that nominated him.<br>
<br>
The Academic Senate commended Kliger not only for his research and his service to the campus, but also for his teaching at all levels and his mentoring of over 40 graduate students and postdoctoral researchers in his research program.<br>
<br>
Kliger received his B.S. in chemistry from Rutgers University and his Ph.D. in chemistry from Cornell University. Before coming to UCSC, he was a postdoctoral research fellow at Harvard University. He has published about 150 scientific articles and three books.<br>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  <a href="mailto:mckenna@cats.ucsc.edu"><br></a> Educators are invited to attend a two-day symposium on teacher quality that is being sponsored by UCSC's <a href="http://newteachercenter.org">New Teacher Center</a> on January 27-28. The gathering, "Keeping the Dream Alive: A Quality Teacher for Every Child," will focus on teacher quality and educational equity, with an emphasis on new teacher support and development of the teaching profession. The meeting will take place at the Doubletree Hotel in Monterey. Among the nationally prominent presenters are Kati Haycock, director of The Education Trust in Washington, D.C., who will deliver the opening keynote address, entitled "Good Teaching Matters," on January 27. Also presenting will be Sharon Feiman-Nemser, professor in the Department of Teacher Education at Michigan State University, who will discuss how mentor teachers combine support and assessment; Enid Lee, a Toronto-based education consultant who will deliver the morning keynote address entitled "Teaching for Transformation," on January 28; and Terry Janicki, a consultant with the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing, who will participate in a panel presentation on teacher induction called "The State of Affairs." Fees are $250 per person, including reception, meals, and materials. Hotel accommodations and parking are additional. To register, or for more information, call the New Teacher Center at (831) 459-4323. The UCSC-based New Teacher Center, located in downtown Santa Cruz, is a national resource dedicated to teacher development and the support of programs and practices that promote excellence and diversity in America's teaching force. The nation's schools will hire at least two million new teachers over the next decade, yet more than one-third of all new teachers leave the profession within the first three years. The New Teacher Center encourages schools to invest in innovative induction practices that provide the support beginning teachers need to become highly skilled, committed, and caring professionals.

<p>
  The Seymour Marine Discovery Center, a new public education center at Long Marine Laboratory, was formally dedicated in a ceremony to honor the donors on Saturday, January 15. The event included a dedication ceremony, a ribbon cutting, and a reception inside the Seymour Center.
</p>H. Boyd Seymour Jr. and his family were guests of honor at the dedication ceremony in recognition of their $2 million cornerstone gift. Private donations funded nearly all of the Seymour Center's $6.25 million cost. Seymour chose to name the center in honor of his father, Harry Boyd Seymour (1896-1977), and his grandfather, Arthur McArthur Seymour (1864-1919). Both men graduated from UC Berkeley and were prominent attorneys in Sacramento.<br>
<br>
Participants in the dedication ceremony included Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood; Leon Panetta, former chief of staff under President Clinton and a trustee of the UC Santa Cruz Foundation; John Simpson, executive vice chancellor and campus provost; Paul Irwin, president of the UC Santa Cruz Foundation; and Robert Stephens, owner of Elkhorn Native Plant Nursery and former cochair of the capital campaign committee.<br>
<br>
"The three components of our mission at UC Santa Cruz--teaching, research, and public service--all come together at the Seymour Marine Discovery Center," Greenwood said. "It is a marvelous facility for the public education program at Long Marine Laboratory and a wonderful resource for the community. Building this new center was indeed a community effort, and I am grateful to all those who helped make the Seymour Marine Discovery Center a reality."<br>
<br>
Gary Griggs, director of the Institute of Marine Sciences, served as master of ceremonies at the dedication. In his remarks, Griggs emphasized the role of the Seymour Center as a resource for educating the public about marine science.<br>
<br>
"It's critical that we explain to our children and the public what we have discovered about the oceans and what it means if we are to sustain ourselves on this planet," Griggs said.<br>
<br>
Numerous individuals and foundations made significant gifts to help fund the Seymour Center, including the J. M. Long Foundation, Emmet and Leanore Hooper, Paul and Anne Irwin, David and Rebecca Kashtan, the Kresge Foundation, Anne and Paul Levin, Zoe Ann Orr Marcus, Frances McAllister, the Moore Family Foundation, the David and Lucile Packard Foundation, the Simpkins family, Richard and Mary Solari, Robert Stephens and Julie Packard, the Wayne and Gladys Valley Foundation, and the Dean Witter Foundation.<br>
<br>
The dedication ceremony does not mark the opening of the Seymour Center. Staff continue to put the finishing touches on the center and are finalizing the education programs in preparation for a public Grand Opening celebration on the weekend of March 11 and 12.<br>
<br>
"With great excitement, the Seymour Marine Discovery Center opens its doors on March 11 to visitors from around the world, and around the corner," said the center's director Julie Barrett Heffington. "We hope all who visit leave with a better understanding of marine science, and perhaps look more carefully at the world around them, test their own ideas, and ask intriguing questions."

        <title>New book honors the magic of music</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 17 Jan 2000 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>8546</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_8545" align="alignright" width="180"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/01/lieberman.00-01-17.180.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-8545" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/01/lieberman.00-01-17.180.jpg" alt="" width="180" height="232" /></a>[/caption]
<p>
  "It's the vibration, stupid." That's the way drummer and author Mickey Hart jokingly explains the transformative power of music. But Hart, who played with the Grateful Dead until the band broke up, and longtime collaborator <a href="http://arts.ucsc.edu/faculty/lieberman/index.html">Fredric Lieberman</a>, a professor of music at UCSC, have far more eloquent things to say on the subject. In fact, as they worked on numerous other projects together, the two discovered that there have been many people with profound and inspirational things to say about the magic of music.
</p>That realization was the inspiration for their latest collaboration, <a href="http://mhart.com/Pages/sispgs/sisintro.html"><i>Spirit into Sound: The Magic of Music</i></a>, published last November by Grateful Dead Music. The book is a collection of quotes and thoughts on the power of music that spans millennia and mindsets--featuring everyone from Ayatollah Khomeini to Gustav Mahler to Janis Joplin to Plato, who says, "Music training is a more potent instrument than any other, because rhythm and harmony find their way into the secret places of the soul."<br>
<br>
"These wonderful images were full of light and wisdom, somehow speaking the unspeakable, touching the untouchable," Hart writes of the quotes they gleaned for their book. "In this collection, which is laced with some thoughts and recollections of our own, we try to present the wonder of music in the words of those touched by its magic."<br>
<br>
"<i>Spirit Into Sound</i> is no Bartlett of music but rather a collection of striking epiphanies that we ran across over the past 18 years while working on the earlier books and other projects," Lieberman says. "We think of the book as a conversation with many musicians and musical thinkers across time and space."<br>
<br>
Throughout their years of collaboration the authors sought out quotes on music for their own inspiration. When they found one that struck a chord, they would write it down on an index card and post it on the wall of their study. As the collection grew, the cards snaked across the wall becoming an entity that Hart and Lieberman affectionately call the "anaconda."<br>
<br>
<i>Spirit into Sound</i> includes roughly 400 of the most interesting and inspiring quotes from the anaconda, but also includes the commentary of the authors. "After we selected the quotes, we sat down together and discussed their meaning and relevance," Lieberman explains. "From these discussions, I wrote a series of short essays that appear throughout the book, commenting on the quotes and sometimes connecting them to Mickey's life as a performer."<br>
<br>
This is the third book Lieberman and Hart have co-authored. Their others are <i>Drumming at the Edge of Magic: A Journey into the Spirit of Percussion</i> (also authored by Jay Stevens and published by HarperSanFrancsico, 1990) and <i>Planet Drum: A Celebration of Percussion and Rhythm</i> (HarperSanFrancsico, 1991). They have also collaborated on numerous recording projects, including <i>The World</i>--a series of nearly 30 recordings released through Rykodisc--and a three-CD package titled <i>The Bali Sessions</i>.<br>
<br>
A booksigning is planned at Bookshop Santa Cruz at 7:30 p.m. on Thursday, March 9.<br>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_8543" align="alignright" width="170"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/01/haddad.00-01-17.170.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-8543" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/01/haddad.00-01-17.170.jpg" alt="" width="170" height="249" /></a>[/caption]
<p>
  It's tough for environmental scientist Brent Haddad to address California water policy issues in the wake of the movie <i>Chinatown</i> and the book <i>Cadillac Desert.</i> Even Californians who know little about the state's pending water crisis know enough history to fear that thirsty cities and greedy developers will do anything to get their hands on water, even destroy prime agricultural land.
</p>But Haddad, an assistant professor of environmental studies at UCSC, is determined to make room for new ideas. In his new book, <a href="http://www.islandpress.org/books/bookdata/riverogold.html"><i>Rivers of Gold: Designing Markets to Allocate Water in California</i></a> (Washington, D.C.: Island Press, 2000), Haddad has developed a formula for water reallocation that pays uncommon attention to issues of equity between cities and farms. He envisions a system of water markets for the Golden State that embraces historical usages while satisfying the growing thirst of urban areas.<br>
<br>
Virtually all water in California is already spoken for by farms, cities, and environmental interests. With no new sources on the horizon, the challenge becomes one of reallocation. Agriculture consumes the lion's share of developed water--about 85 percent--and agricultural irrigation districts typically have direct water rights or contracts with the state and federal government.<br>
<br>
The need for an effective allocation system is clear: Cities are growing, and they have the demographic, economic, and political power--as well as the financial clout--to get more water. Some cities are willing to pay $10,000 for a permanent acre foot of water, which is enough to supply two to four houses a year, said Haddad. There are very few rules governing where cities can buy land, and without an effective water reallocation system, Haddad predicts that cities will get into the business of "water ranching," or buying up farmland. That occurred in the Owens Valley area of southern California, a saga that is depicted in both <i>Cadillac Desert</i> and <i>Chinatown.</i><br>
<br>
"Because water is so critical to the well-being of the region in which it is being used, you're bound to hurt somebody if you transfer water," said Haddad. "You have to compensate the losers, in this case farmers and rural communities, which is why the institutional design is so important."<br>
<br>
For two decades, policy makers and academics have been talking about using a market system to allocate water, but they have been unable to create an effective design, said Haddad, who has extensive professional experience with designing markets for natural resource management and environmental protection.<br>
<br>
Haddad's proposal would create:
<ul>
  <li>A system of smaller regional markets that would operate under statewide transfer limits set by legislators.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Specific review procedures for proposed transfers that would be slightly broader than existing environmental impact reviews and would include consideration of the economic and social interests of the region that would be losing water.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Incentives to encourage urban regions to develop a long-term commitment to the well-being of the region from which they are taking water.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Requirements that farmers demonstrate at the end of a multiyear lease-transfer their ability to put the water to its original agricultural use. Farmers would have to meet the requirement in order to continue to hold the rights to the water; such a rule would prevent farmers from becoming water dealers, said Haddad.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  "Everybody loses a little, but nobody loses everything, and the state could gain an effective water reallocation system," said Haddad, whose book includes detailed case studies of the three major historical water transfers in California: the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California's attempts to acquire water from the Palo Verde Irrigation District and the Imperial Irrigation District, and the Castaic Lake Water District's efforts to acquire water from the Devil's Den Water District.<br>
  <br>
  Under Haddad's proposal, the concepts of "feasibility" and "appropriateness" would be weighed as heavily as the traditional economic notion of "efficiency" when evaluating proposed water transfers.<br>
  <br>
  "Some proposals have been too cumbersome, or too politically unrealistic, or too economically problematic to ever have a hope of accomplishing the end goal, so I'm saying that projects have to be feasible," explained Haddad. "By appropriateness, I'm stressing that these processes need to be consistent with the basic values governing California society and that transfer proposals should be compared in that light, with support going to the ones that are most in line with the state's values."<br>
  <br>
  Such concepts represent a significant departure from traditional market design and might be dismissed as "ivory tower optimism," concedes Haddad, whose accomplishments prior to joining academia suggest otherwise. Haddad was one of the nation's first emissions traders under air pollution regulations, and as a financial adviser he held a number of securities licenses. As a scholar, Haddad specializes in environmental policy, investigating the use of market-based methods to manage natural resources. As a well-established tool to manage air and water pollution, such strategies involve the creation of property rights that allow companies and individuals to trade their shares.<br>
  <br>
  Markets have the potential to help solve California's water problems, asserts Haddad. The scope of urban need is not nearly as large as many imagine, said Haddad, suggesting that history--with the aid of popular culture and special interests--has distorted the picture.<br>
  <br>
  "Agriculture is by far the biggest water user in California, but even if we doubled urban water use to 30 percent of the supply, which is way more than cities would need, agriculture would only drop to 70 percent," said Haddad. "It's not like we're going to lose farming in California, even in the worst case scenario."<br>
  <br>
  That margin allows for creativity, he added.<br>
  <br>
  "Economists tout the efficiency of open markets, but in this case we don't have to have the most efficient system to satisfy our policy goals," said Haddad. "We can afford to lose some transfers that make sense in theory in order to get transfers that work in practice."<br>
  <br>
  If water ranching is discouraged and no new allocation system is put in place, Californians will have three options, according to Haddad: conservation, which is already taking place; water recycling, which many find unpalatable; and desalination of seawater, which is prohibitively expensive.<br>
  <br>
  "Farmers are worried about losing their water rights, but it's inevitable that they are going to lose some water," said Haddad. "Here's a way to do it while preserving as much of the agricultural way of life as possible."

        <title>Exhibit of work by California artist explores the duplicitous decoy</title>

<p>
  The current exhibit at the <a href="http://arts.ucsc.edu/sesnon">Sesnon Art Gallery</a> features the work of California artist Vida Ratzlaff Hackman. The show, "Decoys," runs through February 25, with an opening reception from 5 to 7 p.m. on Tuesday, January 18.
</p>Hackman, who died last April, was a familiar presence at UCSC in the mid-1980s, having taught twice as a visiting lecturer. The current exhibit features work which explores and expounds on the notion of the decoy.<br>
<br>
"A decoy's function is to lure the bird it represents," Hackman wrote. "However to the viewer unaware of their duplicitous roles, the decoy's imitation of a bird can appear quite innocent. It is the ambiguity of function that is attractive to me and that offers greater opportunities for me as artist to trick and transform--to metaphorically preserve and protect."<br>
<br>
"If [Hackman] has one overarching theme," says artist and art critic Isabel Anderson, "it is the danger and pleasure of allure and entrapment and, along with that, the important modern issue of the relationship between the sphere of public and private life."<br>
<br>
Hackman used elegant objects--drawings, videotapes, monoprints, constructions and environments--to create her rich and vibrant body of work. Her work extends the notion of art as an ongoing continuum rather than as a collection of singular artworks.<br>
<br>
Gallery hours are Tuesday-Sunday, noon to 5 p.m. For more information, call (831) 459-3606.

<p>
  Professor of astronomy and astrophysics Sandra Faber has received the Outstanding Faculty Award for 1998-99 from the Division of Natural Sciences. The award recognizes her distinguished research career, teaching excellence, and commitment to service.
</p>Faber is renowned for her research on the formation and evolution of galaxies and the evolution of structure in the universe. "By all accounts she is one of the leading cosmologists in the world," said David Kliger, dean of the Division of Natural Sciences.<br>
<br>
Kliger added that Faber's students at both the graduate and undergraduate levels have uniformly praised her teaching abilities. "A large number of students have commented in their evaluations that she was the best instructor they ever had," he said.<br>
<br>
Faber has made significant scientific contributions in the areas of structure and formation of elliptical galaxies; the nature, compositions, and motions of stars within a galaxy as related to their ages; and the streaming motions of large numbers of galaxies. Important concepts such as "cold dark matter" and the "Great Attractor" are direct results of work by Faber and her colleagues.<br>
<br>
Faber has worked closely on two of the major optical astronomy ventures of recent years: the Hubble Space Telescope and the W. M. Keck Observatory. She is a member of Hubble's wide field/planetary camera team, which directs many of the telescope's most striking observations. And for nearly two decades Faber has helped plan and develop the Keck Observatory in Hawaii, home to the world's largest optical and infrared telescopes.<br>
<br>
Kliger also noted Faber's extensive service to the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, the UCSC campus, and the UC Observatories/Lick Observatory. She has served on many important committees and has been instrumental in bringing many new faculty members to the campus.<br>
<br>
Faber is among an elite group of scientists who have been elected to both the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. She is one of just four non-emeritus faculty members in the UC system elevated to the post of "University Professor." This is the highest honor for faculty in the UC system and is reserved for scholars of international distinction who are recognized and respected as teachers of exceptional ability.<br>
<br>
Faber has served on the California Council on Science and Technology, the President's Advisory Panel of the National Academy of Sciences, and the National Academy's Committee on Astronomy and Astrophysics. Currently, she serves on the Board of Trustees of the Carnegie Institution of Washington, on the board of the SETI Institute, and as director of the executive committee for the Annual Reviews.<br>
<br>
Faber earned her B.A. in physics from Swarthmore College and her Ph.D. in astronomy from Harvard University. She joined the faculty of UCSC and the UC Observatories/Lick Observatory in 1972.

  In order to inform members of the campus community of construction impacts, <i>Currents</i> is now posting monthly updates on any construction projects that affect transportation and parking. <b>Interdisciplinary Sciences Building</b> Construction will start on the Interdisciplinary Sciences Building, a new addition to the eastern end of Natural Sciences 2, in early February and last through fall 2001. The building will provide over 34,000 square feet for the Environmental Studies, Astronomy and Astrophysics, and Physics Departments. Expect traffic delays on Steinhart Way, the service road to the Science Library, Earth and Marine Sciences, and Natural Sciences 2. The loading dock to Natural Sciences 2 will be closed. Pedestrian paths will be rerouted along the construction site, and the pedestrian bridge to the Cowell Health Center will be closed. <b>Core West Parking Structure</b> Construction on the Core West Parking Structure at the intersection of Heller and McLaughlin Drives has already begun and is expected to last until December 2000. The six-story parking structure will provide approximately 500 parking spaces. Beginning in February, many cement trucks will be traveling up Heller Drive and turning onto McLaughlin Drive about once a week. This should usually occur on Thursdays, but may happen on other days, depending on changing construction schedules. Expect traffic delays in the project area. Parking Lots 112 and 113 are closed. In order to compensate for these lost parking spaces, the North Remote Parking Lot is now reserved for cars with A and B parking permits and is no longer available for remote parking permits. New shuttle service between the North Remote Parking Lot and Science Hill is now offered. The Day East Remote Core route serves these areas every 15 minutes between 7:30 a.m. and 6 p.m. weekdays. The Express Night Core route provides drop-off service to the North Remote Lot weeknights after 6 p.m. New maps and schedules are available at the <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/taps/maps.html">TAPS</a> Web site. <b>Bay Tree Bookstore expansion and Graduate Commons</b> Work will continue on the new Bay Tree Bookstore and Graduate Commons Buildings through summer 2000. There will be occasional traffic delays due to construction vehicles. Expect construction noise in the immediate area. The short section of Hagar Drive between Steinhart Way and McLaughlin Drive continues to be a one-way street. <b>Web sites that provide additional information</b> Visit the <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/taps/">Transportation & Parking Services</a> Web site for information on parking, maps of the campus, and alternative transportation. Visit the <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/ppc">Physical Planning & Construction</a> Web site for updates and maps on road closures, other construction impacts, and current and upcoming construction projects.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  <a href="mailto:mckenna@cats.ucsc.edu"><br></a> Governor Gray Davis has made education his top priority, and he is increasingly turning to the University of California, including UCSC, for help in generating tangible results. His latest budget proposals are further endorsement of UC's work assisting public schools.
</p>In his budget proposal that was unveiled last week, Davis is seeking a major expansion of UC's professional development programs for K-12 teachers. Davis's endorsement of UC's current efforts in these areas was underscored by his funding of several new institutes for high school math, science, and English teachers that will be operated by UC in collaboration with California State University, several private colleges and universities, and K-12 schools and districts.<br>
<br>
"The faculty and staff of UCSC have distinguished themselves through their work with K-12 schools," said Francisco Hernandez, vice chancellor for student affairs, who oversees the Educational Partnership Center. Several statewide programs are housed at UCSC because of the campus's innovative ideas and statewide leadership, he noted.<br>
<br>
"More than ever, schools are asking us for assistance as they address the critical issues of student performance and teacher preparation," said Hernandez. "With the governor's support, we are prepared to provide an even higher level of service."<br>
<br>
One of UCSC's existing programs that is slated for funding is the <a href="http://newteachercenter.org">New Teacher Center</a> (NTC), a national resource that ties together research, practice, and policy in support of the development of the teaching profession, with a particular focus on new teachers. Davis's budget includes $600,000 for the NTC, which director Ellen Moir said will help the center expand its offerings.<br>
<br>
"We're already an important voice across the state and on the national scene regarding teacher induction, and we're doing intensive work in the Monterey Bay region and Silicon Valley," said Moir. "This support will allow us to do more in those regions and to increase our capacity statewide."<br>
<br>
In addition, Davis singled out the UCSC-based UC College Prep (UCCP) Initiative for $3 million. UCCP offers online advanced placement courses to students in schools throughout California that offer few or no AP classes. The pilot program, which began in 1998, was expanded to reach about 200 students in seven counties this past fall, and project director Elaine Wheeler said Davis's proposal would help to further expand UCCP, which has the potential to reach thousands of students.<br>
<br>
"Our program's growth is based in large part on our successful partnerships with high schools," said Wheeler, noting that UCSC's team tailors offerings to the needs of each school. "This has the potential to become a cost-effective way that UC can help fill some of the curriculum gaps in what high schools have to offer."<br>
<br>
Current offerings include AP and college-prep courses in chemistry, composition, physics, biology, mathematics, macroeconomics, microeconomics, and statistics. Online courses can help students boost their grade-point average and enhance their college applications, said Wheeler, adding that providing these courses online increases opportunities for underserved students to compete.<br>
<br>
Finally, if the governor's proposed budget is approved, the campus's plans to establish a regional center in Santa Clara Valley would benefit from a $1.1 million infusion of state funds. Efforts are currently under way to identify potential sites for the center, which would offer research, teaching, and community service opportunities for UCSC faculty, students, and staff, while also raising UCSC's profile in Silicon Valley.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  Office of the President On January 10 Governor Gray Davis unveiled a 2000-01 state budget proposal that would fund a dramatic expansion of the University of California's professional development programs for K-12 teachers and make a major investment in UC research benefiting the state's economy.
</p>The governor's budget also would provide funding for UC to enroll 6,000 new students, strengthen undergraduate education, provide faculty and staff salary increases to help maintain quality programs, and prevent any increase in mandatory systemwide student fees for the sixth consecutive year.<br>
<br>
"This is a superb budget for the University of California," said UC President Richard C. Atkinson. "We are pleased that the governor has affirmed UC's role in assisting the public schools and fostering economic growth in California. The governor also has provided an increase in our basic budget that allows us to maintain access, quality, and affordability."<br>
<br>
Atkinson also thanked the governor for honoring key funding principles of a partnership agreement that UC, the California State University, and the Davis administration have been developing. Such an agreement would provide long-term funding stability for higher education, and UC and CSU would commit to accountability on performance measures of importance to the state.<br>
<br>
Overall, the 2000-01 budget proposal would provide UC with a 12.1 percent, $328 million state General Fund increase over 1999-2000. More than one-fifth of this increase is attributable to the governor's teacher development initiatives for UC. The university's state-funded budget would total $3 billion under the plan.<br>
<br>
<b>K-12 and Outreach Initiatives</b><br>
<br>
The budget includes nearly $70 million to create or expand UC-led programs providing professional development to teachers in California's public schools. The proposals include a $20 million expansion of the California Subject Matter Projects, which provide subject-specific professional development to K-12 teachers; and a $14 million augmentation to the Governor's Reading Professional Development Institutes, which would expand to serve 14,000 K-3 teachers, up from the 6,300 now being served in the program's first year.<br>
<br>
The package also includes funding to establish the California Algebra Institutes for high school algebra teachers; to initiate the California Mathematics Institutes for teachers in grades 4-6; to double state support for the English Language Development Professional Institutes for high school teachers; to establish Professional Development Institutes for high school math and English teachers; and to expand the New Teacher Center at UC Santa Cruz.<br>
<br>
While UC would take the lead in administering these programs, all segments of education would collaborate in their implementation, Atkinson said. "We look forward to working with our partners in higher education and the public schools to expand opportunities for the professional development of California's teachers," Atkinson said. "Well-trained teachers are indispensable to seeing that all students receive an education that will ensure they reach their full potential."<br>
<br>
Beyond the $70 million for teacher development programs, the budget includes a $3 million augmentation to a UC program providing online Advanced Placement courses to students in schools with few or no AP classes; additional funding for the California State Summer School for Math and Science, which provides enrichment to academically talented high school students; and funding to develop Algebra and Pre-Algebra Academies for students in grades 7-8 and 4-6, respectively.<br>
<br>
The budget also would provide $1 million to improve the transfer rate of community college students to UC; $1 million to expand outreach efforts for graduate and professional school students; and $500,000 for research on the root causes of educational disparity in California.<br>
<br>
<b>Research Initiatives</b><br>
<br>
The governor has made a major commitment to university research benefiting the state's economy by offering $75 million in capital funding for three California Institutes for Science and Innovation to be established at UC campuses. Each center would focus on scientific and engineering research in a sector key to the future of the California economy, bringing together faculty, undergraduates, graduate students, and industrial partners to work in cross-disciplinary teams aimed at developing the next generation of knowledge in the field.<br>
<br>
Specific sites for the centers would be selected based on proposals submitted by the campuses. State funding for the centers would be matched by private and federal sources.<br>
<br>
"The research innovations and skilled workforce provided by UC have played a critical role in the success of the California economy in the 20th century," Atkinson said. "These centers will help California remain competitive in the 21st century by mobilizing the state's best scientists and engineers to stimulate innovation in fields critical to our collective future."<br>
<br>
The budget also would provide funding for UC research in several areas of high priority for the state, including engineering and computer science, environmental science, and collaborative research with Mexican scholars on U.S.-Mexico issues. It also includes $8 million for UC to provide access for faculty and students to Internet2, a high-speed data transmission network.<br>
<br>
<b>Overall Operating Budget</b><br>
<br>
The governor's overall budget for UC includes funding for an enrollment increase of 6,000 students, or 4 percent, consisting largely of "Tidal Wave II" students -- the Baby Boomers' children who are expected to swell UC's enrollment 43 percent by 2010. The budgeted enrollment increase for 2000-01 also reflects UC's efforts to increase enrollments in engineering, computer science, and education credential programs in order to meet state workforce needs in these areas.<br>
<br>
The governor's budget would provide state funding to avoid a 4.5 percent increase in mandatory systemwide student fees, which have not been raised since 1994-95. These fees, not including campus-based miscellaneous fees, would remain at $3,429 for undergraduates and $3,609 for graduate students. The budget also would prevent an increase in professional school fees.<br>
<br>
Other highlights of the budget include $6 million as the first step in a multi-year plan to strengthen the quality of undergraduate education at UC; a $26 million augmentation for deferred maintenance, instructional technology, instructional equipment and library materials; $25 million in one-time funds for equipment at UC teaching hospitals; funding for salary adjustments, including merit increases, for faculty and staff as part of a continuing effort to maintain competitive salaries; and augmentations for the California Digital Library and Cooperative Extension programs.<br>
<br>
The budget provides $1.1 million to begin planning an off-campus center in the Santa Clara Valley, one of several strategies UC is pursuing to accommodate enrollment demand over the next decade. UC also has requested state funding for summer instruction as part of an effort to expand summer course offerings, which are not currently state-supported. UC will work with the governor and Legislature this spring to address the policy and funding issues associated with this proposal.<br>
<br>
<b>Capital Budget</b><br>
<br>
In addition to the capital funding provided for the three research centers, the governor would fully fund the Regents' $213 million capital budget. This capital budget includes 36 construction, renovation, and seismic retrofit projects at the nine existing UC campuses and also includes $14.3 million for initial site development, planning, and infrastructure at UC Merced.

        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  Office of the President California's top high school students will have the opportunity to explore and study advanced mathematics and science with leading researchers from the University of California during intensive, month-long summer school academies to be established at UC Santa Cruz and UC Irvine. Students participating in the California State Summer School for Math and Science (COSMOS) will be offered a challenging curriculum, some of which is not traditionally covered in high school courses. Areas of study will include astronomy, biological sciences, chemistry, computer science, earth sciences, engineering, mathematics, ocean and marine sciences, and physics. Subjects offered at each campus will reflect their specific areas of research expertise.
</p>

<p>
  The goal of the COSMOS program is to motivate the most academically talented and creative minds of the next generation of prospective scientists, engineers, and mathematicians to participate in the business and higher education sectors of the state.<br>
  <br>
  Students in grades nine through 12 will be eligible to apply. Students chosen to participate in the COSMOS program must exhibit academic excellence in the sciences or mathematics, both in the classroom and through extracurricular activities such as science fairs or performance on standardized tests.<br>
  <br>
  Each academy will host up to 250 students, who will live in on-campus student housing. The month-long programs will begin on June 26 at UC Santa Cruz and July 5 at UC Irvine. The state is providing $1 million in annual funding for COSMOS.<br>
  <br>
  At UCSC, the program will be overseen by Carrol Moran, director of the Educational Partnership Center, Lynda Goff, vice provost and dean of undergraduate education, and Francisco J. Hernandez, vice chancellor for student affairs.
</p>

<p>
  At UCI, the academy will be administered by Juan Francisco Lara, assistant vice chancellor of enrollment services and director of UCI's Center for Educational Partnerships, and Ronald J. Stern, dean of the School of Physical Sciences.<br>
  <br>
  Similar to the California State Summer School for the Arts founded in 1987, COSMOS will offer students college experience and the opportunity to study with leading secondary school teachers of mathematics and science as well as university mathematicians, scientists, and engineers. Academic activities will include hands-on laboratory experiences and team problem-solving competitions.<br>
  <br>
  At UC Santa Cruz, students will have opportunities to visit the University of California Observatories/Lick Observatory, the Joseph M. Long Marine Laboratory, the Tech Museum of Innovation, the Monterey Bay Aquarium, the NASA-Ames Research Center, and technology firms in Silicon Valley.
</p>

<p>
  In addition, students will be introduced to an array of academic resources offered at and nearby the host UC campus. At UC Irvine, such visits may include the Beckman Laser Institute, the UCI Brain Imaging Center, the UCI Observatory, and the San Joaquin Freshwater Marsh Reserve. Off-campus excursions may include visits to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, the California Institute of Technology, the Scripps Institution of Oceanography at UC San Diego, and research-and-development facilities at area high-tech companies.<br>
  <br>
  At both campuses, a strong residential life component will round out the experience.<br>
  <br>
  A statewide advisory board will be formed to guide the planning and administration of the COSMOS program. Its members will include faculty from UC and other public and private universities and business leaders.

  <font color="#003399">Public talk and exhibit of photos on rural India</font>
</h4>

<p>
  While conducting research for her dissertation in environmental sociology, Lisa Bunin traveled to central India to study the re-emergence of organic cotton farming. Farmers in the Nimar and Vidarblha regions who had embraced the "Green Revolution" in the 1960s, became disenchanted with chemical-intensive agriculture by the mid- 1980s and sought new ways to farm without toxic chemicals, drawing on a mix of historical local knowledge and field experiments. Bunin chronicles her research on these farming communities in an exhibit, titled "Organic Cotton: A Developing Story in Rural India," on display at the Bridge Gallery at Porter College through January 16. There will be a reception and a public talk by Bunin on January 13 at 7 p.m. at the gallery. For more information, call Lisa Bunin at (831) 425-7121.

<p>
  Thousands of elephant seals are now returning from their fall migrations for the winter birthing and breeding season at Ano Nuevo, a major rookery for seals and sea lions 55 miles south of San Francisco. How the elephant seals spent their months at sea, a question once shrouded in mystery, is becoming much clearer thanks to some sophisticated new tracking technologies deployed by UCSC scientists. Among other things, the researchers have found striking differences between male and female elephant seals in their migration patterns and feeding strategies.
</p>The research team, led by professors of biology Burney Le Boeuf and Daniel Costa, has been studying the diving behavior and diving physiology of northern elephant seals since 1983. Other researchers--Dan Crocker, Susanna Blackwell, Paul Webb, and Dorian Houser--joined the team as graduate students and are now at other institutions.<br>
<br>
The group's most recent findings come from tracking the daily movements of 47 elephant seals during the two foraging trips the animals make each year, spending months at a time at sea. Satellite tracking devices and data recorders attached to the 27 adult males and 20 adult females traced their migration routes and diving patterns with unprecedented accuracy. The results revealed several interesting features of elephant seal migrations, including the following:
<ul>
  <li>Male and female elephant seals travel to different areas and feed on very different kinds of prey.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Male elephant seals show remarkable consistency in their migrations, following the same routes to the same places year after year.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Females follow more variable routes, apparently pursuing prey that move from place to place in the open ocean.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  UCSC researchers deployed the first time-depth recorder on an elephant seal in 1983 and documented the seals' phenomenal diving abilities. Adult females, for example, can dive to depths of nearly 5,000 feet and can remain submerged for more than an hour.<br>
  <br>
  "We were amazed at the results, which gave us our first insights into the animals' behavior at sea, but these recorders provided only information on what the animals did, not where they went or how they got there," Costa said. "Tracking the animals' movements by satellite allows us to put their diving behavior in the context of where it occurs in the ocean."<br>
  <br>
  The group's most recent results have not been published yet, but the researchers have presented their findings at various scientific meetings. In December, Le Boeuf and Crocker presented papers at the biennial meeting of the Marine Mammal Society in Hawaii.<br>
  <br>
  Scientists have long known the general migration patterns of male and female elephant seals. Both sexes leave the rookery after the breeding season ends in March. The females depart first and return to molt in May, after which they head back out to sea on an eight-month foraging trip. The males are at sea for about four months in the spring, return to molt in mid-summer, then embark on another four-month foraging trip. The food the seals gather on these trips is crucial, because it must sustain them through long periods of fasting while they are on land.<br>
  <br>
  "Fifteen years ago, we knew woefully little about the diving and foraging behavior of marine mammals," Le Boeuf said. "We knew the seals entered the sea to feed and returned at predictable times, but we knew nothing about what they did and how they did it. Technological advances in instrumentation, microcomputers, and satellite technology have changed all of that."<br>
  <br>
  In their recent tracking studies, the researchers found that the males headed north and traveled directly to certain areas along the continental margin, ranging from coastal Oregon to the Aleutian Islands in western Alaska, almost 3,000 miles from Ano Nuevo. The largest males tended to travel the greatest distances to their feeding grounds. Once a male reached its destination, it stayed there to feed before heading back to the rookery. Females, in contrast, ranged across a wide area of the northeastern Pacific, feeding in the deep waters of the open ocean and moving from place to place.<br>
  <br>
  "The sexes are foraging for prey quite differently, and they have to because of the discrepancy in size between males and females," Le Boeuf said.<br>
  <br>
  Male and female elephant seals are markedly different in size and appearance, a phenomenon known as sexual dimorphism. The adult males, with their extraordinary trunk-like noses, can weigh almost 3 tons and are three to seven times larger than mature females.<br>
  <br>
  In several cases, the researchers were able to track the same animal during more than one migration and found that they tended to follow the same route every time. The males, in particular, were remarkably consistent, traveling identical routes to and from the same feeding grounds year after year. Females tended to start out in the same direction each time, but ended up following different routes on successive trips.<br>
  <br>
  "The males seem to be going to a fixed place to feed, whereas the females are feeding on patchily distributed prey that shift around from place to place," Le Boeuf said.<br>
  <br>
  Diving profiles also indicated different feeding behaviors in the two sexes. The predominantly flat-bottomed dives of the males suggest a descent to the seafloor to feed on bottom-dwelling prey, such as skates, rays, ratfish, small sharks, and hagfish. The females' jagged-bottomed dives suggest they were pursuing prey that moved up and down in the water column with available light, primarily several species of squids.<br>
  <br>
  Male elephant seals gain substantially more weight during these foraging trips than the females do, despite spending less time at sea feeding. They may be finding more food, eating higher-quality food, or both, Le Boeuf said. Putting on weight is of critical importance to male elephant seals, because a male's size largely determines his ability to win fights with other males, and his dominance status is directly related to success in mating with females. A dominant male is able to control a large harem of females, mating with them exclusively and keeping all other males away.<br>
  <br>
  This reproductive system, known as polygyny, is the evolutionary force driving the sexual dimorphism and divergent foraging strategies in elephant seals, Le Boeuf said. Because the largest males father most of the pups, natural selection has favored larger and larger males with correspondingly high-energy requirements.<br>
  <br>
  The males expose themselves to additional risks, however, in foraging along the continental margin. Killer whales and white sharks are known to prey on elephant seals along the coast and around the Aleutian Islands, while the females are less likely to encounter such predators in the open ocean. Thus, the males migrate longer distances and take more risks than the females, but it pays off for the survivors in terms of foraging success and, ultimately, reproductive success.<br>
  <br>
  The females' foraging strategy is not without its vulnerabilities, however, as was demonstrated during the 1997-98 El Nino season. El Nino brings unusually warm waters into the northern Pacific and significantly alters the distribution of fish species, including squid. In 1998, females tracked by the researchers spent more time looking for patches of food and less time feeding in any one location than in normal years, said Crocker, now at Sonoma State University. The result was that the females did not gain as much weight as usual, which could significantly affect their breeding success.<br>
  <br>
  UCSC researchers are using similar tracking technologies to study a variety of marine mammals. "We are able to monitor continuously the diving pattern of a seal, sea lion, or whale in minute detail for up to a year at sea, and we are learning unexpected things," Le Boeuf said. "Ironically, we now know more about behavior at sea than about some behaviors on land."<br>

  Three members of UCSC's psychology faculty have contributed entries to the multivolume <i>Encyclopedia of Creativity</i>, published by San Diego-based Academic Press. The encyclopedia provides specialized information about virtually all aspects of creativity and was edited to be beneficial to scientists, doctors, inventors, teachers, business leaders, writers, actors, dancers, as well as painters, graphic artists, and architects who will draw inspiration from the life and works of their favorite artists. Among the nearly 200 entries are articles by Professor Ray Gibbs, who wrote an article entitled "Metaphors," Associate Professor David M. Harrington, who authored a piece titled "Conditions and Settings/Environment," and Professor Emeritus Pavel Machotka, who wrote about Paul Cezanne. The encyclopedia's text is enhanced by illustrations and photographs that appear throughout.

  <b>Colin W. Leach</b>
</h4>Assistant Professor of Psychology<br>
<br>
Colin Leach is a social psychologist whose research areas are social comparison and intergroup relations. He examines the ways in which people compare themselves to others, both better and worse off, and how those comparisons make them feel about themselves, others, and their environment. His work on intergroup relations in the U.S. and Western Europe focuses on the interplay of psychology and politics in ideology. Leach earned his Ph.D. from the University of Michigan and had a chancellor's postdoctoral fellowship at UC Berkeley. He comes to UCSC from Swarthmore College.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  In the wake of an <a href="http://senate.ucsc.edu/">Academic Senate</a> meeting in December that was called to consider a proposal to replace the campus's Narrative Evaluation System with UC's conventional grading system, the senate has scheduled two forums in January in order to solicit campus input about the way in which student performance at UCSC is assessed. In addition, the annual Convocation on Teaching, scheduled for Monday, February 14 (changed from Friday, February 11), will explore the subject: "NES and Pedagogy: Are Narrative Evaluations Important to Teaching and Learning at UCSC?"
</p>

<p>
  The two forums this month will take place on Tuesday, January 18, from 4 to 5:45 p.m. in the Media Theater, and on Monday, January 24, from 4 to 6 p.m. in Classroom Unit 2.
</p>

<p>
  Members of the campus community who are interested in submitting proposals for discussion at one of the two forums are asked to do so at least five days in advance of either forum. Proposals should be sent to the senate office (<a href='("mailto:senate@cats.ucsc.edu"'>senate@cats</a> or 125 Kerr Hall).
</p>

<p>
  The February 14 convocation will take place from 3:30 to 5:30 p.m. in Classroom Unit 2.
</p>

<p>
  For more information, call (831) 459-2086.

        <title>'One-stop' scholarly searching unveiled in new release of the California Digital Library</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 10 Jan 2000 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>8525</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  UC Office of the President
</p>

<p>
  New features including a sophisticated online tool to simultaneously search many different scholarly information sources have just been added to the <a href="http://www.cdlib.org/">California Digital Library</a> at the opening of its second year of service to the University of California and the public.<br>
  <br>
  The experimental new tool--dubbed "SearchLight"--and many of the journal, reference, and library databases it searches are available to the public. For visitors to the California Digital Library and for the 315,000 scholars, students, and staff of the University of California, SearchLight and other enhancements help integrate the traditionally separate tasks of discovery and use of information.<br>
  <br>
  The California Digital Library (CDL) Web site and many of its resources, including digitized collections of photographs, manuscripts, and other archival materials from institutions around the state held in the Online Archive of California, are also available to the general public.<br>
  <br>
  The CDL, which partners with the nine UC campuses in a continuing commitment to apply innovative technology to the management of scholarly information, opened to the public last January.<br>
  <br>
  As a digital "co-library," complementing the physical libraries of the UC system, the CDL uses technology to efficiently share materials held by UC, to provide greater and easier access to digital content, and to join with researchers in developing new tools and innovations for scholarly communication.<br>
  <br>
  The January release of new features represents another step forward in UC President Richard C. Atkinson's vision of "a future when our libraries, at the press of a button, can come to us, wherever we are, whenever we wish."<br>
  <br>
  SearchLight facilitates "one-stop shopping" for a research topic or it can be used to explore the most promising resources when working in an unfamiliar subject area.<br>
  <br>
  For instance, a patron may be interested in the theory of particle physics that treats elementary particles as "string-like" objects. Entering a single SearchLight search on "string theory," the researcher will view a single results screen showing the availability of hundreds of relevant books in UC library collections, 350 abstracts from the National Science Foundation grants and awards database, and various other materials publicly available.<br>
  <br>
  A University of California researcher will additionally discover more than 10,000 journal citations from licensed databases such as Inspec, Current Contents and ArticleFirst. Additionally, he or she will be able to view online more than 220 relevant journal articles related to string theory drawn from the nearly 5,000 electronic journals made available through the CDL to the UC community.<br>
  <br>
  Several other enhancements and significant additions of digital content to the CDL will be a boon to researchers.<br>
  <br>
  The CDL has additional coverage in engineering through Ei Village database services, and in science and social science with more than 240 electronic journals from Wiley and 32 titles from the Institute of Physics.<br>
  <br>
  UC faculty, graduate students, and staff can now place automatic requests for book and journal article delivery from throughout the nine-campus system with a single click on the "Request" button found in CDL-hosted databases.<br>
  <br>
  New experimental and applied research resources draw upon cutting-edge technology and are the results of research partnerships. In addition to the SearchLight tool, the Alexandria Digital Library of maps, aerial photographs, a place-name gazetteer, and other geo-spatially referenced information debuts here.<br>
  <br>
  UC Press Electronic Editions include the full content of approximately 60 UC Press books, which are available via links in search results of the Melvyl Union Catalog of all UC library collections.<br>
  <br>
  The CDL-hosted Databases interface, which includes access to the Melvyl Catalog, now includes a drop-down menu for easy linking to other journal databases. Improvements to the CDL's Directory of Collections, including more than 4,800 electronic journals, more than 50 journal article databases, and 4,000 inventories or "finding aids" to archival collections, have been streamlined with clear information about availability.<br>
  <br>
  Many of the January enhancements of the California Digital Library are the result of suggestions from faculty and students, campus librarians, and members of the public. Soliciting these comments and working with advisory groups and the digital library and computer science research communities allow regular improvements to the look, feel and usefulness of the CDL for UC, for Californians and for the public.

<p>
  A visual artist, computer scientist, composer, and pioneer in the field of virtual reality (a term he coined), Jaron Lanier has been called one of the most extraordinary thinkers of our time. As society advances in its uneasy embrace with technology, Lanier is both advocate and antagonist of this partnership--a duality he seems to relish. One month he may oversee a public showing of his interactive computer-generated artwork and the next he may organize a public computer-bashing ceremony.<br>
  <br>
</p>With his long, blondish dreadlocks and piercing blue eyes, Lanier looks as radical as his thoughts. His work in virtual reality has generated a range of devices and applications from interface gloves to real-time surgical simulation to virtual puppets (one of his latest projects). In his wide-ranging artistic endeavors, he has collaborated with the likes of Philip Glass, Ornette Coleman, and Stanley Jordan and exhibited his paintings, drawings, and virtual art around the world.<br>
<br>
Lanier is currently a visiting scholar with the Department of Computer Science at Columbia University, a visiting artist with New York University's Interactive Communications Program, and a founding member of the recently established International Institute for Evolution and the Brain.
<p>
  <b>Jaron Lanier speaks on "Technology and the Future of the Human Soul" on Tuesday, January 25, in the Mainstage Theater. Tickets are $18 adults; $15 seniors and students with ID; $9 UCSC students. For more information, call (831) 459-2159. This lecture is presented by UCSC</b> <a href="http://events.ucsc.edu/artslecs"><b>Arts & Lectures</b></a> <b>in partnership with Imagesmith.</b>
</p>
<hr>
<p>
  Q: You have Santa Cruz roots, don't you?<br>
  <br>
  A: In 1980, my ambition was to be a Santa Cruz street musician. There were a lot of extraordinary people in Santa Cruz who took me in and supported me. . . . But there were also those extraordinarily well paying jobs in Silicon Valley and, eventually, off I went to my fate.<br>
  <br>
  Q: You're considered by many to be the inventor of virtual reality. You identified the concept, and you've invented devices and software fundamental to many widely used VR applications. How would you describe your work in the field?<br>
  <br>
  A: Well, I made up the term "virtual reality," and, depending on what you think the term means, I made the first instance of it. But any discussion of virtual reality has got to include mention of Ivan Sutherland who built the first head-mounted display in the '60s.<br>
  <br>
  What I did was make the first virtual worlds with multiple people in them and the first that fully took advantage of the human body, having gloves and bodysuits drive virtual bodies that could pick up virtual objects.<br>
  <br>
  Q: What is virtual reality?<br>
  <br>
  A: Virtual reality is a computer-supported way of creating the illusion of being in an alternative world with other people. It's a sort of dreaming you do consciously that other people can be a part of. It can be used practically for such things as surgical planning or to design a car, or as an art form, to experience the joy of expression, the pain of expression.<br>
  <br>
  Q: As a visual artist, you're probably best known for the virtual worlds you've created. What is the value of this digital art--is it poignant, meaningful, expressive, beautiful? Do you see something redemptive in digital art?<br>
  <br>
  A: Redemptive? Hardly. I think virtual art presents a challenge. It can sometimes even be a menace that robs reality of all its meaning and of all its juice.<br>
  <br>
  Every other type of artist does better by loving his/her tools--a painter loves the canvas, the paint; a sculptor, the marble. But the best digital artists hate computers. I hate computers. I personally derive pleasure from destroying computers.<br>
  <br>
  Computers are the first medium to have ideas built in. Paint is a piece of nature; cameras are products of nature--they're made of metal, you use emulsions to process the images. You can say there's some theory involved with using a camera, but to find a machine that really has ideas built in, you have to go to the computer. By its nature, a computer has ideas built in because it has a program, which is, basically, ideas that have been frozen into it.<br>
  <br>
  When you try to create with those frozen ideas, well, suppose you're a musician: You can't just work with a computer like it was piano, you have to stick ideas in first. Is music made of discrete notes or continuity? When you use a specific music program the choice has been made for you. So, as soon as you start using it, you start nailing yourself down. When you start working with a computer in a creative process, the danger is that you start treating these human constructions as if they came from nature, or God--however you describe it. That's a good reason to hate computers--realizing that they structurally confine you to ideas that someone thought of yesterday.<br>
  <br>
  As soon as you're feeling frustrated you know you're on the right track, because you're not just slipping into the pathway the software is designed to take you on.<br>
  <br>
  In every other medium you want to understand the material and see what it wants to do. But that's not true with computers. The mistaken path would be to treat the computer as paint and let it drive your process. In every other medium that's the thing to do--it's important to let the medium speak to you. But with computers you must not because computers speak bull.<br>
  <br>
  Q: But you use computers in your creative work.<br>
  <br>
  A: It's possible to do art with computers but it's very hard. I think that when art is at its best, it is better than the artist. You can do that with computers too, but not if you respect them.<br>
  <br>
  I don't want to hold up my own work as succeeding and breaking through this problem--that's for others to decide--but there are some ways to break through and one is to be very careful not to get caught up in the computer itself. To think of it as something like a telephone instead of like a television--a channel between people. You concentrate on the people and their experiences and not on what's inside the computer.<br>
  <br>
  I think a lot of people make the mistake of getting lost in the world of the computer. It's very easy to get caught in the nerd trap, and then life loses all its color.<br>
  <br>
  Q: So, in the right hands, the technology can serve as a tool to help articulate a creative vision. Do you think Michelangelo could have made great electronic art?<br>
  <br>
  A: I've thought about that and my best guess is, you could revive a Van Gogh or a Beethoven or some other great Western artist and they could fiddle around with the technology. What they'd make would be some great, maybe even incredible, junk. But that's about it, because they wouldn't be on guard against the technology. I've seen some skilled classical artists get involved in computers and turn out some pretty bad stuff.<br>
  <br>
  Q: On the flip side, do you think computers are capable of creating great art? What do you think of David Cope's work with the program that simulates the styles of classical composers?<br>
  <br>
  A: Let's imagine you and I are in a relationship and for years I've written you wonderful love letters. And I'm a computer scientist and one day I say, "You know, I'm going to prove my prowess by getting my computer to analyze all my love letters, dig out the most profound parts, and put them together to make the best love letter of all." Which would you rather get in the mail?<br>
  <br>
  The point isn't the achievement, the output. The point is the actual connection. You have to remember that even great music like Bach's is only barely adequate to bridge the terrible interpersonal gap that separates people. The last thing you want to do is create an emphasis on the artifact rather than the authentic human connection. Show me a new way to be authentic and I'll get excited about that. A new way to be inauthentic, by having computer-simulated Bach, why that's as easy as lying. Truth is what's hard.<br>
  <br>
  Q: What are the greatest challenges we'll face as technology becomes more and more integral to everyday life?<br>
  <br>
  A: Genetic engineering--the engineering of life in general--is going to be huge in the next ten years. The general picture is going to emerge sometime soon of what we can and can't do to a person. By all indications, it looks like we can do a lot: We can extend our life spans, compose our children, even recompose ourselves as adults to a degree. I think it's going to be the greatest challenge our species has ever faced. More challenging than nuclear weapons. With nuclear weapons, the only question is, can we survive them or not. With biotechnology it's not an either/or situation, it's a design question: Who do we want to be as a species. It's a profoundly difficult question. Nobody who understands it is going to have a clear unconflicted point of view--unless they're a moron.<br>
  <br>
  We'll be faced with decisions that are very subtle. And it's going to happen fast because the growth of technology is not going to be advanced by grand abstract ideals but by people with intimate, immediate needs. Technology is not going to be driven by Dr. Frankenstein but by the couple who wants to keep their baby alive.<br>
  <br>
  Q: You talk about different paths that the integration of technology and humanity can lead us on. What are the dangers?<br>
  <br>
  A: We are going to face the question of whether a machine and a person are the same thing. Most of my colleagues think machines should eventually be treated the same as humans and that's where I'm different. Someday computers may be able to seem intelligent and conscious--it's a possibility. And most people who believe in that possibility think that at the point when machines can act human they should be given human rights. I strongly disagree with that. There's a philosophical difficulty in that point of view: The danger is that people are so flexible that we may subconsciously make ourselves stupid in order to make the machines seem smart.<br>
  <br>
  Q: What do you mean? How will we make ourselves less smart?<br>
  <br>
  A: We already do it. Have you ever known anybody who borrowed money to get a credit record so that they could get a loan approved later on? That's the kind of thing that didn't happen when real people decided if you should get credit. People believe in what the computer says, but it's not smart to borrow money needlessly. We do so to convince a computer that we deserve credit.<br>
  <br>
  But let's not talk about that future. Let's talk about the good future. Let's talk about what a human being is.<br>
  <br>
  A human being is a sack of stuff that is conscious. And the really interesting thing about that is that the sacks are separate. That's a really amazing thing. If you were an alien advance team writing home about Earth you'd say something like, "There are all these cool species and there's one that seems to be smart, but they are all separated from each other. They're in these weird sacks they call skin."<br>
  <br>
  The most fundamental aspects of the human experience are that we're separated from each other and we die. You can imagine other alien life forms that are not like that, that are something else, let's say intermingled clouds that interact and transform but don't ever die. So these are very striking things about us as humans.<br>
  <br>
  Since human beings first appeared, we've sought to bridge this gap. We can look at the whole history of humanity as advances in bridging this gap--we came up with language, and we created drama, and we said, "Oh, we'll invent writing, and we'll have a telephone." You can think of technology as being a result of this incredible epic quest that people have to reach each other over this gap. And virtual reality fits in beautifully to bridge this gap as a conscious form of dreaming.<br>
  <br>
  What I see in the future is people learning to be ever more expressive to each other and new forms of communication between people becoming ever more intimate and outlandish and beautiful. I don't think there's any limit to that.

        <title>New institute will support research on the global environment and planetary sciences</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 10 Jan 2000 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  UC's Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics (IGPP), a multicampus research unit, is expanding to include a branch on the UCSC campus. The UCSC branch of the institute will address fundamental questions relating to Earth's environment, global change, and planetary sciences.<br>
  <br>
  The IGPP supports a wide range of basic research on the origin, structure, and evolution of the Earth, the solar system, and the universe. One of the goals of this research is to predict future changes in global systems that may affect human life.<br>
  <br>
  "The establishment of an IGPP branch at UCSC provides important support for our strong programs in planetary and environmental sciences that will allow them to move to an even greater level of excellence," said David Kliger, dean of the Division of Natural Sciences.<br>
  <br>
  Initially, the UCSC branch will include two interdisciplinary research centers: the Center for Origin, Dynamics, and Evolution of Planets (CODEP) and the Center for Dynamics and Evolution of the Land-Sea Interface (CDELSI). A subsequent expansion is planned that will add a Center for Remote Sensing and a Center for Massive Computing Simulations.<br>
  <br>
  Thorne Lay, professor and chair of earth sciences, spearheaded the proposal for the new IGPP branch at UCSC. "Our basic strategy was to capitalize on our strengths by identifying key areas of interdisciplinary excellence and building on those areas," Lay said.<br>
  <br>
  The two interdisciplinary centers, both established about a year ago, serve to create bridges between different departments and heighten the focus on collaborative research efforts, Lay said.<br>
  <br>
  The Center for Dynamics and Evolution of the Land-Sea Interface brings together faculty from six areas: biology, earth sciences, ocean sciences, environmental toxicology, anthropology, and environmental studies. Researchers in these departments are at the forefront of efforts to understand the complex processes and interactions occurring at the continental margin.<br>
  <br>
  "The land-sea interface, where the continent meets the ocean, is one of the most dynamic and important interfaces between natural systems," said James Zachos, professor of earth sciences and director of the center. "This is a region where marine and terrestrial systems are coupled through atmospheric and hydrologic processes."<br>
  <br>
  A primary concern of the center's researchers is the impact of global and regional climate change on key processes in the coastal environment, such as atmospheric circulation, ocean temperature and currents, nutrient cycling, and the geological processes that shape the continental margin.<br>
  <br>
  The Center for Origin, Dynamics, and Evolution of Planets brings together faculty from UCSC's Institute of Tectonics and the Departments of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Earth Sciences, and Physics. The interests of CODEP researchers include Earth's internal dynamics, the formation of planets, how planetary systems evolve, and the discovery of new planets outside the solar system.<br>
  <br>
  "This is a joint effort to understand as much as possible about planets in general, both in our own solar system and around other stars," said Gary Glatzmaier, professor of earth sciences and director of CODEP.<br>
  <br>
  The center encourages earth scientists and astronomers to bring their different perspectives to bear on the same problems. For example, Glatzmaier's computer simulations of the internal dynamics of planets have focused mostly on Earth's core and how Earth's magnetic field is generated. Now, with the help of two graduate students, he is studying the dynamics of the interiors of giant planets, such as Jupiter and the Jupiter-sized planets that UCSC astronomer Steven Vogt and his coworkers are discovering around nearby stars.<br>
  <br>
  Glatzmaier was involved in the IGPP when he was a researcher at Los Alamos National Laboratory before coming to UCSC. "A strong institution like IGPP, with a long history and a lot of good people associated with it, is a valuable addition to the campus," he said.<br>
  <br>
  The IGPP was established in 1946 at UCLA. Other branches are located at UC San Diego, UC Riverside, Los Alamos National Laboratory, and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. A key objective of the IGPP is to encourage and support cooperative projects that bring together researchers from different disciplines and institutions, said the institute's UC systemwide director Jean-Bernard Minster, a professor of geophysics at UC San Diego.<br>
  <br>
  "The new branch will result in enhanced collaboration between UCSC researchers and researchers at other campuses and the national laboratories," Minster said. "This is the first new branch of the IGPP on a UC campus since 1968, and its approval shows considerable momentum on the part of the faculty at UCSC."

<p>
  Imagine actually observing a stalactite forming drip by drip, a constellation navigating the sky, or sweet peas vining their way up a trellis. Of course it's impossible to witness such subtle wonders but, through the evocative work of Butoh dancer Maureen Fleming, one can experience them.<br>
  <br>
</p>Fleming's performances have been described as authentic, primal, and transformative. As she moves, she seems to defy the constraints of sinew and bone, gravity, and motion. Her style is rooted in the minimalist Japanese dance form of Butoh, and Fleming's exquisite mastery of the form creates a dreamlike experience for her audiences--profound and thrilling, personal and universal all at once.<br>
<br>
When she comes to UCSC in January, Fleming will perform the show "After Eros," a piece she created in collaboration with composer Philip Glass and writer David Henry Hwang (author of the Tony award-winning play <i>M. Butterfly).</i> Fleming will also conduct a public workshop on motion on Saturday. Her visit is presented by UCSC <a href="http://events.ucsc.edu/artslecs">Arts & Lectures</a>.<br>
<br>
Fleming has been dancing professionally for two decades. She trained classically before going to Japan to study Butoh. "One of the aims of Butoh is to tap into the primal energy of transformation," she explains. "Classical dance often gets mired in focusing on forms, whereas Butoh is always working to get to the place where this energy is alive."<br>
<br>
To tap into that energy, Butoh dancers envision and evoke imagery; for example, Fleming says, a smoke ring moving up her back or elastic wrapped around her fingers. In many ways, Butoh is as kindred to sculpture as it is to dance. The performer takes a form or emotion and works through it--imagine what might have happened to Rodin's "Thinker" if he had finished his thought.<br>
<br>
"Oftentimes my work is compared to Henry Moore and [Constantin] Brancusi," Fleming confirms. "I almost see myself more as a sculptor than a choreographer. I try to make images that really burn into someone's unconsciousness. It's a process of reducing movement to a symbol or an archetype: When my body becomes a circle, I want it to bring forth the unconscious of the observer."<br>
<br>
In the stream of critical praise published on Fleming's show in the past three years, a common sentiment is often voiced--the impact of Fleming's performance lasts long after the house lights go up. Her burn is deep.<br>
<br>
True to the transformative spirit of Butoh, Fleming's "After Eros" addresses a car accident she experienced as a child. Fleming was two years old at the time, living in Japan with her parents. As she describes it, "A man on a bicycle darted in front of our car, and when my mother slammed on the brakes I crashed into the windshield. My mother says that the man looked at us, laughed, and rode away."<br>
<br>
Fleming had no memory of the accident, in which her sister was also injured, but a number of years ago when she was experiencing neck pain her doctor discovered a bone spur in her neck. "Ask your mother what happened to you as a child," he advised. When Fleming did, she learned of the accident.<br>
<br>
It explained a lot. Ever since she can remember, Fleming has followed an instinct to dance and, long before she knew of Butoh, she had developed her own style of slow twisting motions--choreography that nursed her bone spur, preventing it from callusing and causing nerve damage.<br>
<br>
"It was amazing to realize that all of my choreography had come out of that process of taking care of my neck," she marvels. And it is that process that she addresses in "After Eros"--how a source of pain can become a source of strength.<br>
<br>
The "Eros" in the title refers to the mythological story of Eros and Psyche. The mortal woman, Psyche, is so beautiful that she is being worshipped in place of Aphrodite. A jealous Aphrodite orders her son, Eros, to make Psyche fall in love with the ugliest man in the world. Instead, Eros is pricked by his own arrow and falls in love himself.<br>
<br>
Psyche is told by an oracle that she will never marry a mortal but must go live on a mountaintop with a horrible monster. She accepts her fate and goes to Eros's palace and falls in love with him. Eros forbids Psyche to look on his face and when she sneaks a look one evening he is infuriated by her betrayal and abandons her. Psyche (whose name means "soul" in Greek) accomplishes three impossible trials set for her by Aphrodite, winning the sympathy of the gods. She and Eros reunite and she is granted the gift of immortality. Hwang summarizes the story poetically in his text when Psyche says, "I have become the one whose love I sought."<br>
<br>
For Fleming, the engaging theme in the story is that of attaining wholeness by facing and embracing one's tragedy. "We've all had those tragedies, it's what we do with them that matters. For me, it was being sent through the window and achieving transformation through that experience. I want this performance to give people hope for their own life and to face their own tragedies, to be open to the possibility of transformation through tragic experiences."

        <title>Only minor Y2K problems occur on campus; others may still appear in months to come</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 03 Jan 2000 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>8518</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  The winter quarter at UCSC opened with only a few relatively minor Y2K glitches on Monday, January 3. No power outages were experienced in the Santa Cruz area, other utility services to the campus were uninterrupted, and the campus's payroll-personnel and student and financial information computer systems passed into Year 2000 without difficulty.
</p>

<p>
  Pat LeCuyer, acting assistant vice chancellor for Communications and Technology Services, says only three Y2K-related problems had been discovered by Monday morning: erroneous dates were appearing in one of the headers in e-mail created by users of the UC Berkeley mail system (expected to be fixed this week), an error message was appearing when users attempted to modify files using the Unix-based "vi" editing system (fixed), and faculty and staff--but not students--were experiencing an access problem using the Web-based Narrative Evaluation database system (expected to be fixed early this week).
</p>

<p>
  So, all of UCSC's Y2K worries are behind us, right?
</p>

<p>
  Not quite.
</p>

<p>
  Lisa Rose, director of Materiel Management, says Y2K problems in other countries may result in unpredictable disruptions in supply chains--for months. "It's very hard to identify which products may be affected," she says. "My recommendation to people has been to stockpile up to one month's supply of those products or materials that you deem critical to your operation."
</p>

<p>
  LeCuyer says the campus systems' successful transition to Year 2000 is a great satisfaction to the programmers who spent portions of the past two years assessing hundreds of thousands of lines of computer code--and making necessary corrections.
</p>

<p>
  But it doesn't mean that other minor system problems couldn't still crop up. "While we didn't have major problems with our mission-critical computer systems, I suggest that people stay vigilant with regards to reports they receive and system screens and interfaces," says LeCuyer. "Pay attention to dates being displayed and any formulas which compare dates or use them in arithmetic operations."<br>
</p>

<p>
  People should also pay attention to data files that they have on their individual workstations or on departmental servers, LeCuyer says, as many of those files may still have dates stored with a two-digit century. "They will need to convert these dates to a four-digit century format if they want the dates to sort correctly, or if they use these dates in any calculations."<br>
</p>

<p>
  The industry-wide estimate is that only 10 percent of Y2K problems will have surfaced on January 1, 2000, LeCuyer adds. "The remaining 90 percent will emerge over time, so it's important that we stay vigilant."<br>
  <br>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  Anyone who's fallen in love with a book and then gone to see the movie remake knows the dangers of adaptation. But most of us keep going back again because, sometimes, the adaptations are good and, when they are, the only thing better than curling up with a favorite book is seeing it come to life.
</p>Audiences have been able to find great adaptations on the big screen (<i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i> and <i>Fried Green Tomatoes</i> are good examples), but the attempt is made less frequently for the stage.<br>
<br>
A handful of theater companies across the country are dedicated to bringing the text to stage, and one of the most outstanding is Word for Word, a San Francisco-based company. Their work has won critical and popular acclaim, and, even more amazing, praise from the authors whose works they perform. Word for Word is performing in Santa Cruz as part of UCSC's <a href="http://events.ucsc.edu/artslecs">Arts & Lectures</a> program's 1999-2000 season.<br>
<br>
Since 1993, Word for Word has been performing short stories on stage. But, rather than adapting texts, as their name implies, Word for Word actually presents entire works verbatim.<br>
<br>
"A lot of people are confused," says Word for Word co-artistic director Susan Harloe. "They think they're either coming to see a revision of a book or to see a staged reading. But this is a complete performance, with blocking, and sets, and costumes. We simply make the text a play, and we perform every word."<br>
<br>
For years, directors have seen the crossover potential of novelists like Charles Dickens, who naturally write with a theatrical flair. But Harloe and co-artistic director JoAnne Winter have evoked great performances from a wide range of literary styles. Among the authors whose works they have used are Barbara Kingsolver, Ray Bradbury, Langston Hughes, Rudyard Kipling, Grace Paley, John Sayles, Eudora Welty, Richard Ford, and Ring Lardner.<br>
<br>
It can be challenging figuring out how to deliver certain lines from a text, Harloe says. "Dialog is easy, of course. But how do you perform the narration? Somehow we've got to figure out a way for someone to say sentences like, 'The two women spoke on the telephone. One was busy typing away.'"<br>
<br>
To determine how they will break the text down into a script, who will say various lines, company members get together and decide collaboratively while reading the work. "This is very much a group effort and it works best if done organically," Harloe says. "Sometimes we might even divide a sentence up so that one word stands alone. You can't do this without a strong ensemble."<br>
<br>
Before Harloe and Winter formed Word for Word, Harloe was co-artistic director of the Seattle-based company, Book-It, which also performs short stories on stage. Word for Word's award-winning performances are highly regarded and the company is successful enough to support an annual tour to France. But despite its reputation, Harloe says that many audiences members shy away from the shows because of misconceptions. "I can't tell you how many people come because they have been dragged there by someone else. And they are always pleasantly surprised."<br>
<br>
The Santa Cruz show, "A Night in Eden," features two pieces. <i>A Passion in Eden,</i> by Joanne Greenberg, is the story of a young girl coming of age. The girl faces her imminent adolescence by pretending to be an enormous tree. In a metaphorical growth, she begins to branch out as an independent adult while still supported by her roots at home. Ellen Gilchrist's short story, <i>There's a Garden of Eden,</i> portrays a bored, wealthy older woman. As Harloe says, "She has everything and nothing." The woman's life undergoes interesting changes when a young carpenter comes to work for her and, soon after, a flood takes place.<br>
<br>
Harloe, who plays the lead in Gilchrist's story, says that both authors have seen Word for Word's performances of their works. "We aim to really bring things to life. The fine line we tread is being true to the author's voice. I was really nervous when [Gilchrist and Greenberg] saw the show. But they loved it."<br>
<br>
Word for Word recently adapted a piece by Richard Ford, winner of the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award for his book <i>Independence Day</i> (which has no relation to the movie). "When you invite an author to come all you can do is hold your breath and hope they'll be happy. He was so pleased by what we did. He said, 'I was dazzled by this. I was amazed by this. It was a huge wonder to me.'"<br>
<br>
Harloe says that the authors are almost always pleased by what they see. And so are the audiences. "Writers choose their words carefully and we are very careful about how we say them. We've had half-hour arguments over a comma."<br>
<br>
Harloe and her fellow company members often perform with other, more traditional theater companies, but they are always excited to come back and perform Word for Word's unique form of theater. As Harloe explains it: "Stories are such a human form of expression and everyone responds to them. It's how we communicate--it's how we relate to one another. Everyone wants to hear a story."<br>

  Supervisors who are capable and effective at motivating and managing employees and developing top performers are essential to organizational effectiveness at UCSC. To foster these talents, Training & Development has sponsored the Supervisory Development Program since 1991. The program is open to supervisors of both staff and students and is customized to the campus working environment. Since its inception, more than 360 supervisors have completed the program. The program enables participants to understand supervisory roles and responsibilities, plan for effective communication and problem solving, recognize and resolve conflict, build and lead diverse teams, network with other supervisors, and use a variety of resources available at UCSC. "The Ombudsman's Office has long supported supervisory training and will continue to support and recommend this type of program to campus managers and supervisors," said Tom Webster, the campus's associate ombudsman. Among those who have participated in the program is Elvia Moreno-Ontiveros, human resources coordinator at the Educational Partnership Center. "The program enlightened my thinking about my roles as a supervisor and, most importantly, connected me with a network of counterparts I can rely on for help in problem solving," she said. "It was an excellent experience that will really pay off by saving a lot of time and mistakes in the long run." Kathleen Hughes, an administrative analyst at OPERS, also participated in the program. "The supervisory development workshops were definitely worth the time and effort," she said. "I appreciated the fact that subjects covered were directly related to responsibilities and challenges associated with being a supervisor at UCSC. In particular, I benefited from exploring leadership styles and effective communication models, and learning about style differences when approaching conflict." The program is offered twice a year and is linked to additional training, such as performance management and diversity awareness. In 2000-0l, a series titled "Advanced Skills for Supervisors" will be offered. For more information, visit the <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/train-dev">Training & Development Website</a>.

<h4>
  <b>Tara Madhyastha</b>
</h4>Assistant Professor of Computer Science<br>
<br>
Tara Madhyastha's research on data storage in computer systems focuses on how to make the storage and retrieval of data faster. The input/output (I/O) interface between the computer processor and the data-storage system often limits the performance of data-intensive applications, such as data mining (looking for patterns in large datasets) and satellite data processing. Madhyastha is pursuing a variety of methods for improving I/O performance, including techniques that automatically analyze data-access patterns. Madhyastha received her B.A. in computer science and English from Rutgers University and her M.S. and Ph.D. in computer science from the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. Before joining the UCSC faculty she was a postdoctoral research fellow at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. <b>Hongyun Wang</b><font color="#003399"><b><br></b></font>
<p>
  Assistant Professor of Engineering<br>
  (Applied Mathematics and Statistics)<br>
  <br>
  Hongyun Wang specializes in theoretical biophysics and the analysis of complex molecular structures. His research seeks to explain the mechanism by which chemical energy is converted into mechanical work in biological systems. Wang has constructed quantitative models of ATP synthase, an enzyme consisting of two "molecular motors" that plays a key role in the conversion and storage of chemical energy in living cells. Wang received his B.S. and M.S. degrees in mathematics from Beijing University in China and his Ph.D. in mathematics from UC Berkeley. He conducted postdoctoral research in UC Berkeley's Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology before joining the UCSC faculty. He will be a member of the Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics once it is established in the School of Engineering.<br>

  Psychology's <b>Craig Haney</b> has fielded media calls recently about prison-related issues from the <i>Cleveland Plain Dealer,</i> the <i>Riverfront Times</i> in St. Louis, and CNN-Time, which is preparing a story on the backgrounds of people on death row.
</p>

<p>
  A visit to Santa Cruz by the internationally acclaimed band Mariachi Los Camperos de Nati Cano was covered by local and national media. CBS sent a camera crew to shoot a segment for <i>CBS This Morning.</i> <b>Martin Wollesen,</b> director of UCSC's Arts & Lectures (which presented the show), was interviewed for news stories on Fox TV-Channel 35 and for a cover story in the <i>Santa Cruz County Sentinel's</i> entertainment magazine<i>.</i> <b>Roberto Garcia</b> of EAOP was also interviewed about the concert by KSMS TV-Channel 67.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Joseph Bunnett</b>, professor emeritus of chemistry, wrote an editorial in the <i>Santa Cruz County Sentinel</i> about the Narrative Evaluation System, putting the current controversy into a historical perspective. Graduate Student Association chair <b>Kami Chisholm</b> also wrote an op-ed on narratives, which appeared with the Bunnett piece in the <i>Sentinel.</i>
</p>

<p>
  "Over the Wall" a dance concert staged by choreographer <b>Mel Wong</b> earned the cover of the <i>Good Times</i> when it opened in December. The lengthy story (titled "He Did it His Way") focused not only on this performance by the Mel Wong Dance Company but on Wong's long and fertile career.

<p>
  What do a billionaire rapper, a Cuban break dancer, a prison guard, and a young boy in physical therapy have in common?
</p>They all spring from the fertile mind of Danny Hoch. These characters and many others are part of Hoch's critically acclaimed one-man show, "Jails, Hospitals and Hip Hop," presented by <a href="http://events.ucsc.edu/artslecs/">Arts & Lectures</a> on Saturday, January 22, in the Mainstage Theater.<br>
<br>
Hoch was recently described as a "white boy with attitude" by <i>Esquire</i> magazine; and a <i>New York Times</i> critic called him "part sociologist, part moralist, and part super-chameleon." Both are apt descriptions for Hoch, who re-creates a variety of characters from the inner-city neighborhood of his youth with compelling force.<br>
<br>
For the past ten years Hoch has been performing solo on stages across the country. Hoch, who says he comes from "a long line of Lower East Side Jews," draws from his background to create the characters he portrays.<br>
<br>
"Queens is the most multi-ethnic county in the world," Hoch explains. "There were people from 120 different countries living in the projects were I grew up." Also peopling his script are individuals he met during the afternoons he spent at the Bronx hospital where his mother, a speech pathologist, worked. With his chameleon-like powers, Hoch brings those characters to life in his show.<br>
<br>
It may seem like a dicey proposition for a white guy to portray the various ethnic characters that Hoch does, but he manages the feat masterfully. His skill lies partly in the fact that he is re-creating real people from firsthand experience, but the vividness and depth of his characters is also a conscious part of Hoch's creative process. He abhors stereotypes and writes with humor and compassion to evoke three-dimensional people to fill his stage.<br>
<br>
Hoch's rejection of media stereotypes became a public story some years ago when he turned down the role of a pool attendant in a <i>Seinfeld</i> episode because he was asked to play it as a Hollywood stereotype of a Latino named Ramon. (He turned that experience into one of the segments in <i>Jails</i>.) Hoch also rejected a role in Quentin Tarantino's <i>From Dusk Til Dawn</i> because of a racial slur in the script.<br>
<br>
Along with his current show, which he is touring across the country, Hoch is the author of <i>Some People</i>. Also a one-man show, <i>Some People</i> won a 1994 OBIE Award, was filmed as an HBO special, and nominated for a 1996 Cable ACE Award. The texts of the two shows were published in 1998 by Villard Books as <i>Jails, Hospitals, and Hip-Hop and Some</i><i>People</i>.<br>
<br>
Hoch is a presence on the big screen as well. <i>Jails</i> will be released as a feature film in March by Stratosphere Entertainment. Another project, the film <i>White Boys</i>, is due out soon on video. Hoch coauthored and starred in <i>White Boys</i>, which features appearances by such rap stars as Snoop Dog, Doug E. Fresh, and Bonz Malone.<br>
<br>
The subtext to all of Hoch's work is Hip-Hop. Hip-Hop was born on the streets of inner city New York in the mid-1970s. The song credited with launching the Hip-Hop movement is the Sugar Hill Gang's "Rapper's Delight." And, while Hip-Hop can refer to the background music used in rap, in the 20 years since it emerged, it has evolved into an entire culture that incorporates performance arts (music and break dancing), visual arts (mainly in the form of graffiti art), fashion, and politics.<br>
<br>
The signs that Hip-Hop has permeated American culture are everywhere. In November of 1999, Cleveland's Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum launched a major exhibition on the history of Hip-Hop. The billion-dollar industry of Hip-Hop is used to sell everything from Coke to designer clothes. And, perhaps most telling, in 1998, Hip-Hop emerged as the most popular music in America, outselling the previous favorite--country music--by a wide margin.<br>
<br>
"Hip-Hop is the last culture of resistance at the end of the millennium," Hoch says. "Hip-Hop came to prominence ultimately during the Reagan presidency and was tremendously influenced by black culture. Even though it has been co-opted by popular culture, Hip-Hop is the movement that voices the demand for change."<br>
<br>
Hoch, who was born in 1970, has been immersed in the culture basically since he got out of diapers. And his performances and writings resonate with his experience. "Hip-Hop is the future of language and culture in the multicultural society," Hoch writes. "It crosses all lines of color, race, economics, nationality and gender, and Hip-Hop still has something to say."<br>
<br>
When it comes to performance, Hoch is hot-wired, passionate. He not only acts and writes, he spends a good amount of time teaching youth and performing in prisons. As impassioned as he is about his work, Hoch came close to missing his calling.<br>
<br>
"When I was a teenager," he recalls, "I was caught up in what every inner-city kid was caught up in at that time: graffiti, break dancing, petty crime." When an opportunity came up for Hoch to audition to attend a performing arts high school, his mother insisted that he try out. "She made me go, and I think that if I hadn't, well, I wouldn't be talking to you now," he laughs.<br>
<br>
Thank you, Mrs. Hoch.

<p>
  If your New Year's resolution is to get fit and stay fit, you can be sure to keep it by taking advantage of the new Fitness Center at the East Field House. The much anticipated center opens January 4 with two complete floors: one downstairs for classes and sport teams and a second upstairs for use on a drop-in basis.
</p>And you'll have no excuses that you don't know how to use workout machines, as there are numerous classes, personal trainers, videos, and--perhaps most exciting--Technogym machines that give you an individualized workout through a key with a computer chip that you insert into the machines.<br>
<br>
"Technogym is the most sophisticated computerized workout system on the planet right now," said Dan Wood, director of the Office of Physical Education, Recreation, and Sports (OPERS).<br>
<br>
There is no carrying cumbersome charts from station to station or hassling with hand-entering a workout onto a machine. All workout data is saved in a personalized database via the Technogym Smartkey and made available in a variety of easy-to-read reports so each user can see and track his or her own progress and improvement.
<p>
  All you need to do is insert your Technogym Smartkey into the equipment display screen. Since your workout has already been programmed by a personal trainer or through an OPERS class instructor, the computer display will show you which machine to start with, and how many "reps" and sets you should do based on your individual capabilities. Then it will show you which piece of equipment you should go to next in your workout.<br>
  <br>
  On cardiovascular machines, the intensity is adjusted based on feedback from your heart rate. On weight machines, Technogym will tell you which height to set your seat at, how much weight to load, and will guide you on the range of motion and timing of your reps. Technogym will automatically update you to a higher level or workout when you are ready.<br>
  <br>
  While the floor downstairs is outfitted with Technogym, the floor upstairs is equipped with Cybex machines. Cybex machines are renowned for their anatomical correctness and have been used for years in rehabilitation centers.<br>
  <br>
  All in all, the center has 12 treadmills, 8 upright bikes, 6 recumbent bikes, 7 elliptical machines, 4 stairsteppers, 2 rowing machines, and 2 upper body ergometers.
</p>
<p>
  Each floor also has free weights and guided-motion weight machines.
</p>
<p>
  In addition, the upper gym has large windows that offer stunning views of the Monterey Bay to keep you inspired during your workout.
</p>
<p>
  Beginning and intermediate weight-training classes and strength-and-conditioning classes will be offered throughout the week.
</p>
<p>
  New this quarter are the express workouts at lunch and after-work hours. On Monday and Wednesday at 12:15 p.m. and Tuesdays and Thursdays at 5:30 p.m., there will be a 40-minute weight training circuit workout on the Technogym machines. And a back and abs lab will be held daily at 1 p.m. for ten minutes.
</p>
<p>
  Starting spring quarter, classes will no longer be offered through Teleslug; instead, people should come the first day of class and a lottery will be held.<br>
  <br>
  To use the Fitness Center, faculty, staff, students, and others must show an OPERS recreation card. The membership costs $71 per quarter or can be purchased annually at the beginning of each fiscal year.

<p>
  A biology professor, the department assistant for women's studies, and an alumnus who was an environmental biologist defending the human rights of indigenous people in Colombia have won the three top awards given annually by the UCSC Alumni Association. Barry Bowman, Nicolette Czarrunchick, and Terence Unity Freitas, the first person to receive an association award posthumously, were nominated by students, alumni, faculty, and staff; the three were selected by the UCSC Alumni Association Council, the association's governing body. They will be honored at a luncheon on Saturday, February 5, starting at 12:30 p.m. in the Stevenson College Dining Hall. In addition to these awards, nine students will receive recognition for service to their colleges, and 11 recipients of Alumni Association scholarships will be honored. The awards ceremony is open to the public. Tickets to the event, which includes lunch, cost $12 for the general public and $10 for current Alumni Association members and must be reserved by calling the Alumni Association at (831) 459-2530 no later than Friday, January 28. Barry Bowman, a professor of biology at UCSC, won the Distinguished Teaching Award. Former and current students and colleagues wrote letters in support of his nomination, characterizing Bowman as a supportive, yet challenging, mentor to junior faculty, undergraduates, and graduate students. One of his former graduate students wrote, "He encouraged us to drop our passive learning style we had grown accustomed to as undergraduates, and begin to question and think independently of our textbooks and professors."
</p>Bowman's students and colleagues praised him for his clear and often humorous delivery of difficult subjects in his lectures. A colleague wrote, "Barry has a kind, sweet nature which he is able to project to any size audience, and although he is an exceptionally dynamic speaker (in fact, like all great lecturers, he's a bit of a ham), his energetic delivery is always tinged with self-effacing humor and modesty."<br>
<br>
Bowman has served for 12 years as the director of the Minority Biomedical Research Support Program (MBRS), a program dedicated to providing research experience, as well as academic and financial support, to minority students. A biochemistry undergraduate who performed research in Bowman's lab through the MBRS program wrote of Bowman's "undying commitment in the advancement of people of color in the sciences. With the guidance, support, and encouragement of Professor Bowman, I am able to reach my potential as a student of color in the sciences."<br>
<br>
Nicolette Czarrunchick, who won the Outstanding Staff Award, has worked for the Women's Studies Department for nearly 15 years as the department manager; before that, she worked for more than two years as a secretary at Thimann Labs. In nomination letters, faculty, students, and staff praised her for her "legendary patience" and "unfailing empathy, enthusiasm, and expertise."<br>
<br>
As the academic student adviser, who also received her degree in women's studies as a re-entry student in 1993, Czarrunchick is highly regarded by students and faculty for her "understanding of both the intellectual import of feminist scholarship and the needs of our undergraduate students," according to one faculty member.<br>
<br>
Czarrunchick also edits and produces the women's studies annual newsletter sent to alumni and is helping to organize the women's studies library at Kresge College.<br>
<br>
Terence Unity Freitas, a 1997 B.A. recipient in biology and environmental studies, won the Alumni Achievement Award for his work with the U'wa people of Colombia. He was a key activist in the United States who tried to halt the plans of Shell Oil Company and Occidental Petroleum to drill in U'wa territory. He helped establish the U'wa Defense Working Group, a coalition of several environmental organizations, brought an U'wa leader to the United States for several speaking engagements, and led marches in Los Angeles, where Occidental Petroleum is headquartered.<br>
<br>
Last winter, while working with the U'wa to set up a culturally appropriate school, Freitas and two other Americans were kidnapped and killed by Colombia's largest rebel group.<br>
<br>
"The committee members felt that the selfless devotion represented by Terry's work with the U'wa people of Colombia characterized the highest UCSC ideals of service to others," said Carolyn Christopherson, executive director of the Alumni Association.<br>
<br>
In nominating Freitas for this award, a fellow alumna wrote, "He brought what he learned at UCSC in academics and during his lifetime to help this nation of people preserve their culture. I know that Terence worked extremely hard to achieve all that he did in his short 24 years of life. He was a giving person, who gave to people unconditionally. He expected nothing in return except your friendship."

<h4>
  <font color="#003399">Friends of Long Marine Laboratory Student Research Awards</font>
</h4>

<p>
  The research projects of 23 undergraduate and graduate students received support this year from the Friends of Long Marine Laboratory Student Research Awards. The awards, totaling $8,900, support research projects conducted at Long Marine Laboratory or directed towards the understanding of some aspect of the Monterey Bay.<br>
  <br>
  The Friends of Long Marine Lab Awards come from the interest generated by five different endowments: The Jane McHenry Endowment, the Lillian McPherson Rouse Endowment, the William Baye Heald Scholarship, the Friends of LML Endowment, and the Mark T. MacMillan Award, which is specifically set aside for research in marine biology.<br>
  <br>
  The following projects received awards this year:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Peter Adams,</b> graduate student, earth sciences: "Evaluation of wave energy delivery and dissipation along the Monterey Bay shoreline."<br>
    <br>
  </li>

        <title>Chancellor Greenwood focuses on science education issues at AAAS board meeting</title>

        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_8500" align="alignright" width="165"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/01/greenwood_mrc.00-01-03.165.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-8500" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/2000/01/greenwood_mrc.00-01-03.165.jpg" alt="Chancellor M.R.C.

<p>
  The Board of Directors of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) met December 17 and 18 in San Jose to focus on the issue of science education, a top priority of the board's chair, Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood. The board's agenda included a series of panel discussions on education, one of which addressed the educational issues and workforce needs of the Silicon Valley.
</p>Greenwood expressed her concern about the state of science education earlier last year at the AAAS annual meeting in Anaheim, where she delivered the presidential address. An article adapted from that speech appeared in the December 10 issue of the association's journal, <i>Science.</i> In the article, Greenwood urged scientists to become directly involved in efforts to improve science education and the public's understanding of science.<br>
<br>
While recent discoveries and advances give scientists ample cause to celebrate, the United States may be slipping behind other nations in its ability to inspire and educate the next generation of scientists and engineers, Greenwood said.<br>
<br>
"We can already see indications that the next generation is not receiving the preparation necessary to maintain the excellence that U.S. science currently enjoys," she said, pointing to the results of recent surveys that show, for example, U.S. 12th graders near the bottom in international comparisons of science and math ability.<br>
<br>
The educational challenges and solutions of the Silicon Valley provide a unique context for the AAAS board to engage in a dialogue on issues of broad interest to the science and technology community, industry, and educators, Greenwood said.<br>
<br>
Greenwood moderated the panel on Silicon Valley educational issues. Panelists included Carl Guardino, president of the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group; Robert Caret, president of San Jose State University; Leo Chavez, chancellor of Foothill-De Anza Community College District; Susan Hammer, former mayor of San Jose; and Michael Englehardt, CEO of Technology Network. Other panels addressed educational outreach efforts and the role of museums in education.<br>
<br>
The AAAS has a long history of involvement in education and workforce issues. In the 1960s and early 1970s, AAAS was actively involved in the development of school curricula and teacher training. In 1985, the AAAS board launched an initiative in science education reform called Project 2061, which has produced widely used standards-based guidelines for teaching science and mathematics.<br>
<br>
In her presidential address and subsequent <i>Science</i> article, Greenwood proposed a new AAAS program called "Project 20/20" to encourage scientists, engineers, and other scientifically literate professionals to get directly involved in education issues by serving on school boards. Project 20/20 would sustain and support these school board members with information and advice to help them protect and enhance scientific content and accuracy in schools.<br>
<br>
"There is a tremendous opportunity to be a positive influence and to touch the widest possible array of the public by helping to determine such essential issues as curriculum reform, textbook choice, and pedagogy," Greenwood said. "The need for this influence was forcefully demonstrated by the recent assaults on science education in Kansas and Illinois, where creationism has been added to state school board-approved curricula."<br>
<br>
Greenwood acknowledged that concern over science education and public understanding of science is hardly new. She also noted the many valuable education initiatives undertaken by scientific organizations, universities, government agencies, and industries. Nevertheless, she said, scientists need to reexamine their own behavior and enterprises in light of the needs of the broader society.<br>
<br>
"We are living in a dynamic time in which our personal and professional lives change rapidly," Greenwood said. "Education for our children, and lifelong education for all of us, must be paramount in this evolving era."<br>

        <title>Y2K: Prepare for winter quarter now</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 13 Dec 1999 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>9115</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_9114" align="alignright" width="148"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/1999/12/y2kclock.99-12-06.148.gif"><img class="size-full wp-image-9114" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/1999/12/y2kclock.99-12-06.148.gif" alt="" width="148" height="206" /></a>[/caption]
<p>
  So, with less than one month to go before the calendar turns to Year 2000, exactly how Y2K-safe is the campus? Staff who have studied the issue--as well as the hundreds of thousands of lines of the computer code that drive operating systems, applications, and files--believe that all of the campus's primary computer systems will be up and fully functional on January 1.
</p>To be on the safe side, however, a small corps of UCSC employees will be on campus during the first weekend of the New Year, assessing the campus's power grid and testing UCSC's mission-critical computer systems.
<p>
  As an additional backup, units that oversee such systems as the Student Information System, the Payroll-Personnel System, and the Financial Information System have developed contingency plans that will enable the campus to do business even if there are failures.
</p>
<p>
  UCSC's Y2K Task Force is also reminding students, faculty, and staff to take a few steps to help ensure UCSC's smooth transition to the New Year:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Students should remember to complete enrollment for winter classes (via phone or Web) by the end of open enrollment on December 15, make a printout of their winter 2000 class schedule before leaving for the holiday season, and pay registration fees by the December 15 deadline.
  </li>
  <li>Some faculty, staff, and students should also check in to make sure that the campus didn't sustain any major Y2K-related power problems before returning to campus for the beginning of the winter quarter on Monday, January 3.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Specifically, students who live on campus but will be out of the area in the days leading up to January 3 are asked to call <b>459-INFO</b> or visit UCSC's Y2K Web site (<a href="http://y2k.ucsc.edu">y2k.ucsc.edu</a>) between midmorning on Saturday, January 1, and their scheduled return time. Employees who live out of the Santa Cruz area (and may not know of any local power problems) are asked to do likewise.
</p>
<p>
  The Y2K Web site also contains other related resources, including an informational flyer that students, faculty, and staff may print and keep in their possession over the holiday break. Contingency plans that would be in effect should the campus experience significant Y2K-related system failures are also available at the Web site.
</p>
<p>
  KZSC radio (88.1 FM) will also carry reports of the campus's Y2K health during the first weekend of the New Year.
</p>

<p>
  One of the country's oldest and most respected programs in women's studies turns 25 this year. The program is UCSC's very own, which was established in 1973-74 and sent its first graduates into the world in 1974-75.
</p>An interdisciplinary program, <a href="http://humwww.ucsc.edu/wst/index.html">women's studies</a> incorporates numerous fields, including history, literature, politics, sociology, and philosophy.
<p>
  A sign of its prestige and broad-based appeal is the fact that the department attracts more adjunct professors (more than 50 this year) than any other at UCSC.
</p>
<p>
  To mark its anniversary, the department is hosting two years of special events. Among them are the following:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Molly Ivins: One of the nation's wittiest and best known political pundits, Ivins will be in Santa Cruz to present a talk titled "Campaign 2000." Ivins is a nationally syndicated political columnist and best-selling author of a number of books, including <i>Molly Ivins Can't Say That, Can She?</i> The talk is sponsored by UCSC Arts & Lectures, the Women's Studies Department, and the Women's Center. Sunday, March 26, 8 p.m., Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Women's Studies Founders Luncheon: Women's studies faculty, students, and alumni are invited to this special gathering, which takes place during the Banana Slug Spring Fair reunion weekend. Chancellor Greenwood will join the luncheon, which honors women's studies founding faculty members and program graduates. Sunday, April 16, 11 am to 2 pm, UCSC Arboretum.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Dr. Losang Rabgey, "Culture of Contemporary Tibetan Women." April 2000. (Date and location, TBA)<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>"The Color of Violence: Violence Against Women of Color," a national conference taking place at UCSC on Friday, April 28, and Saturday, April 29. Initiated by the UCSC Women of Color Research Cluster, cosponsored by Women's Studies.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>"Towards A Multicultural Women's History": A residency by visiting scholars Darlene Clark Hine, professor of African American history at Michigan State University, and Vicki Ruiz, professor of Chicana history at Arizona State University. May 1-4.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>"Sovereignty 2000: Locations of Contestation and Possibility": A conference sponsored by the Native American Studies Research Cluster and the Women's Studies Department. May 19-20.<br>

Sans Avoir Vu Guillaume Blake! (Don't go any further without seeing William Blake!)": A collage by LeRoy Burkett, production manager of the Trianon Press from the mid-1960s until the close of the press in the early 1980s[/caption]
<p>
  Some of the most stunning reproductions of the work of William Blake, Marcel Duchamp, and many other artists was produced in Paris between the 1940s and 1980s by a small but eminent publishing house named the Trianon Press. Established by Arnold Fawcus and operated by Fawcus and his wife, Julie, who continued the business after Arnold's death, the press quickly gained an international reputation for excellence for its exquisite publications.<br>
</p><br>
In the early 1980s, Julie Fawcus designated UCSC as the home for the press's materials. The acquisition of the Trianon Press Archive was widely considered one of the major achievements in the history of Special Collections, which houses the rare and valuable materials of the University Library.<br>
<br>
An exhibition on display in McHenry Library through December presents some of the treasures of the archive.
<p>
  Exhibition coordinator Maureen Carey and several other library staff had their work cut out for them in selecting which items to display from the extensive archive. To get a sense of the breadth of the archive, it helps to know that it arrived in two massive shipments. The first, which came in 1983, was packed in a 900-cubic-foot container that weighed some five tons. A second, similar shipment arrived in 1988.<br>
  <br>
  The Trianon Press Archive includes manuscripts, proof copies, variant editions, plans, design work, correspondence, unpublished artworks, maquettes, negatives, color decompositions, guide sheets, and stencils. The unrivaled set of the press's collection of its own works numbers more than 70 volumes, many of which are the publisher's unnumbered deluxe copies.<br>
  <br>
  The exhibit features insights into the personalities of the Trianon Press, some of the productions of the press, and a display of volumes demonstrating the techniques of the facsimile reproduction used to create the beautiful volumes of the archive.<br>
  <br>
  A <a href="http://bob.ucsc.edu/library/exhibits/trianon/tpexh.html">virtual exhibit</a> of the archive has been posted and will remain online indefinitely. The exhibit contains text, illustrations, and photographs on the press and its founder as well as links to the William Blake Archive hypermedia archive, an oral history of Julie Fawcus (produced by UCSC's Regional History Project staff), and many other sites.

</p>

<p>
  The Fire Department will be collecting new unwrapped toys for local needy children during the holiday season. Toys can be dropped off between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m., Monday through Friday, at the campus Fire Station on Chinquapin Road, across from the Crown/Merrill Apartments, or at the campus Police Station in the H Barn until December 23.

  <br>
  <font color="#003399"><b>First Night Santa Cruz seeks volunteers</b></font><b><br>
  <i><br></i></b>First Night has become the New Year's Eve thing to do for residents of Santa Cruz County. Last year 30,000 people joined this community celebration of the arts in downtown Santa Cruz. First Night invites both individuals and groups to help create this year's celebration by volunteering to work at the event. Eight hundred volunteers are needed for a variety of tasks.<br>
  <br>
  For a three- to four-hour commitment, all volunteers receive a blinking-light admission button. There are special rewards for volunteers who work after 9 p.m. on December 31. Volunteers who contribute more hours, such as site managers and set-up/clean-up crews, also receive a "Friends of First Night" sweatshirt and are invited to a thank-you party in the new year. Just like the regular admission button, the volunteer button can be used for free bus transportation to and from downtown Santa Cruz on December 31. For more information or to volunteer, call (831) 425-7277.
</p>

<p>
  First Night has a Web site on which people can submit their hopes and wishes for the new millennium. The submissions will all be displayed on large windows downtown during the First Night event. <a href="http://www.scta.org/webwall2000">Webwall</a>

  <font color="#003399"><b>Editorial style guide on the Web</b></font>
</p>

<p>
  <a href="http://pio.ucsc.edu/style_guide.html">A Guide to Editorial Style</a> at the University of California, Santa Cruz, is posted on the Web. The editorial style guide is useful to all campus units preparing printed or online communications. It establishes a consistent editorial style for the campus and answers some frequently asked questions about general editorial usage and style. A list of further reference sources is appended. If you have questions, contact lance@cats.ucsc.edu.<br>

<h4>
  <font color="#003399">Benefits update for Health Net subscribers</font>
</h4>

<p>
  Ongoing contract negotiations between Health Net and Sutter Health/Santa Cruz Medical Clinic could potentially affect between 900 and 1,000 current and retired UCSC employees. Negotiations were not concluded by the end of Open Enrollment on November 22, and the current contract expires on January 31. But the UCSC Benefits Office and the UC Office of the President have made special arrangements so affected employees will not be left without coverage with their chosen physicians, even if a new contract is not negotiated.<br>
  <br>
  Should the contract between Sutter Health/Santa Cruz Medical Clinic and Health Net be terminated, Health Net members enrolled with the Santa Cruz Medical Clinic will be provided with a special enrollment period to choose another health plan.<br>
  <br>
  Health Net members who are enrolled with the Santa Cruz Medical Clinic and wish to remain in Health Net do not need to take any special action. If a special enrollment period is necessary, details will be published in a future issue of <i>Benefits Update,</i> and eligible Health Net members (those enrolled with Santa Cruz Medical Clinic) will receive a notice at their home address. Watch future issues of <i>Benefits Update</i> for additional information.<a href="http://www.scta.org/webwall2000"></a>

  Literature's <b>Tyrus Miller</b> was quoted extensively in a story in the <i>Chronicle of Higher Education</i> on how teachers are broadening the canon of modernist writers they use in the classroom. The quotes were drawn from Miller's book, <i>Late Modernism: Politics, Fiction, and the Arts Between the World Wars</i> (UC Press, 1999).
</p>

<p>
  Planetary scientist <b>Erik Asphaug</b> was quoted in stories about asteroids and planet formation that ran in the <i>Dallas Morning News</i> and other newspapers. Asphaug wrote a commentary accompanying a research article in the journal <i>Nature,</i> and his colorful language was widely quoted. (The asteroid Mathilde, Asphaug wrote, "looks as though some deity has taken large bites from a cosmic potato.")
</p>

<p>
  When French lecturer <b>Miriam Ellis</b> was awarded the rare honor of knighthood from the French government, the news was picked up by local television and newspapers. Covering the story were KSBW-Channel 8, KION-Channel 46; the <i>Watsonville Register-Pajaronian,</i> and the <i>Santa Cruz County Sentinel.</i> Ellis received the award, the Palmes Academique, in recognition of her outstanding work in promoting French arts and culture.

<p>
  In a tremendous outpouring of community support, UCSC students, staff, and faculty collected over 14,000 pounds of food for the Second Harvest Food Bank of Santa Cruz and San Benito Counties. This is a six-fold increase over previous years.
</p>Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood visited the Campus Mail Services on Friday to thank the staff there who collected and transported the bags of food. She was impressed by the sight of the nine large mail hampers brimming with food that would later be put in a Metro Santa Cruz bus. "I am very proud of the campus community's compassionate spirit. This successful food drive is another example of the generosity and civic mindedness of students, staff, and faculty."<br>
<br>
Second Harvest Food Bank provides food to 22 social service agencies and pantries in the area, including the Familia Center, Salvation Army, Daily Bread Food Pantry, Grandma Sue's Community Project, Holy Cross Church, Seventh Day Adventist Church, and People Helping People Pantry.<br>
<br>
Of the 36,000 people to be fed through local agencies and pantries, half will be children, according to Willie Elliot McCrea, executive director of Second Harvest. "There really seems to be an increased understanding that if we really want to break the cycle of poverty, we need to make sure the children are fed so that when they get to school they have the ability to learn and get the skills they need to support their own families someday."<br>
<p>
  Cash donations are still being accepted. For every donated dollar, Second Harvest distributes more than $10 worth of food. Make your check out to Second Harvest Food Bank with a note stating "UCSC Food Drive." Send it via Campus Mail to UCSC Food Drive.<br>
  <br>
  Ronaldo Ramirez and Sheila Gottehrer co-coordinated the successful food drive, along will committee members Manuel Grijalva, Judy Hobor, and John Holloway. Staff from Campus Mail Services volunteered to collect the grocery bags. Students from Sigma Omicron Pi and Pi Alpha Phi raised nearly $200 from their Peanut Butter and Jelly Sandwich food drive. Scott Jones, University Food Service general manager of Sodexho Marriott, donated almost $300 on behalf of UCSC students who each gave one meal from their meal card to UCSC's Food Drive. Santa Cruz Metro Transit donated a bus that was filled full of food. Roger Anderson, Academic Senate chair and Clare Greene, Staff Advisory Board chair, also gave general support to the food drive.

<p>
  The <a href="http://arts.ucsc.edu/sesnon">Sesnon Gallery</a> will host a performance by San Francisco Bay-area humorist and spoken word artist, Lauren Crux. Crux's show is titled "On Being Cool and Other Digressions" and takes place in the gallery on Thursday, January 6, at 8 p.m. A reception follows.
</p>Crux tells stories in a style one critic called, "comedy with tragic pot-holes." She talks about the beauty and horror of life: the messiness, the struggles, and the delights.<br>
<br>
In "On Being Cool and Other Digressions," Crux creates elaborate narratives that are pithy and provocative. About her performances, Crux says, "I address issues relevant to lesbians today including aging, cross-generational influence, identity (are we still lesbians anymore?), politics (around what issues do we organize?), sexuality, desire, and reciprocity."<br>
<br>
Lauren Crux has performed at Highways Performance Space and LACE in Los Angeles, as well as other San Francisco/Bay Area performance venues. Most recently, she was a featured performer for an evening of celebration honoring LGBT Pride Month produced by KQED-Radio.<br>
<br>
For more information, call (831) 459-3606.

[caption id="attachment_9098" align="alignright" width="200"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/1999/12/archer.12-06-99-200.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-9098" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/1999/12/archer.12-06-99-200.jpg" alt="Friends or lovers?

These images from UCSC sociologist Dane Archer's new video illustrates how strongly spatial relationships influence our assumptions about people.[/caption]
<p>
  Sociologist Dane Archer could have titled his latest video on nonverbal communication "Space Invaders." The engaging 28-minute video, which is actually entitled <i>Personal Space: Exploring Human Proxemics</i>, covers many aspects of space, including cultural differences, how space reflects rank in the workplace and within families, the spatial secrets of successful architecture, and how spatial rules govern nearly all human territories, from benches to bathrooms.
</p>"Space affects everything, but the use of it is based on unwritten laws that vary from place to place," said Archer. "This video looks at those differences, and it shows what is revealed by the use of space in different settings and cultures."<br>
<br>
Ever since anthropologist Edward T. Hall began exploring space as the "silent language" in the 1950s, researchers have studied the ways in which people use and are affected by space.<br>
<br>
The study of spatial relations covers both space itself, or proxemics, as well as touch, or haptics. Archer's video, which was shot in Santa Cruz and features UCSC students, covers both areas. It is the latest in a series of educational videos that Archer has produced about nonverbal communication.<br>
<br>
Among the highlights of the video are field experiments that document how people react when their personal space is invaded, including covert glances, shifting position, trying to block out the invaders, and--finally--fleeing. Subsequent interviews with the unwitting "invadees" reveal their discomfort and the extent to which people rely on each other to follow society's unwritten yet implicit rules about space.<br>
<br>
"In the United States, it's our unconscious goal to maximize the distance between people," said Archer. "When our space is invaded, it's very stressful, but only 1 percent of people ever say anything to a space invader."<br>
<br>
The video, which is designed to be a teaching tool for college instructors of sociology, psychology, and anthropology, reveals cultural differences regarding space and touch and describes some of the differences between "noncontact" cultures like the United States, northern European countries, India, and Pakistan, and "contact" cultures in southern Europe, Latin America, and many Arab nations.<br>
<br>
Other highlights include:

        <title>Y2K: prepare for winter quarter now</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 06 Dec 1999 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>9095</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_9094" align="alignright" width="148"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/1999/12/y2kclock.99-12-06.148.gif"><img class="size-full wp-image-9094" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/1999/12/y2kclock.99-12-06.148.gif" alt="" width="148" height="206" /></a>[/caption]
<p>
  So, with one month to go before the calendar turns to Year 2000, exactly how Y2K-safe is the campus? Staff who have studied the issue--as well as the hundreds of thousands of lines of the computer code that drive operating systems, applications, and files--believe that all of the campus's primary computer systems will be up and fully functional on January 1.
</p>To be on the safe side, however, a small corps of UCSC employees will be on campus during the first weekend of the New Year, assessing the campus's power grid and testing UCSC's mission-critical computer systems.
<p>
  As an additional backup, units that oversee such systems as the Student Information System, the Payroll-Personnel System, and the Financial Information System have developed contingency plans that will enable the campus to do business even if there are failures.
</p>
<p>
  UCSC's Y2K Task Force is also reminding students, faculty, and staff to take a few steps to help ensure UCSC's smooth transition to the New Year:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Students should remember to complete enrollment for winter classes (via phone or Web) by the end of open enrollment on December 15, make a printout of their winter 2000 class schedule before leaving for the holiday season, and pay registration fees by the December 15 deadline.
  </li>
  <li>Some faculty, staff, and students should also check in to make sure that the campus didn't sustain any major Y2K-related power problems before returning to campus for the beginning of the winter quarter on Monday, January 3.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Specifically, students who live on campus but will be out of the area in the days leading up to January 3 are asked to call <b>459-INFO</b> or visit UCSC's Y2K Web site (<a href="http://y2k.ucsc.edu">y2k.ucsc.edu</a>) between midmorning on Saturday, January 1, and their scheduled return time. Employees who live out of the Santa Cruz area (and may not know of any local power problems) are asked to do likewise.
</p>
<p>
  The Y2K Web site also contains other related resources, including an informational flyer that students, faculty, and staff may print and keep in their possession over the holiday break. Contingency plans that would be in effect should the campus experience significant Y2K-related system failures are also available at the Web site.
</p>
<p>
  KZSC radio (88.1 FM) will also carry reports of the campus's Y2K health during the first weekend of the New Year.

  <font color="#003399">Benefits update for Health Net subscribers</font>
</h4>

<p>
  Ongoing contract negotiations between Health Net and Sutter Health/Santa Cruz Medical Clinic could potentially affect between 900 and 1,000 current and retired UCSC employees. Negotiations were not concluded by the end of Open Enrollment on November 22, and the current contract expires on January 31. But the UCSC Benefits Office and the UC Office of the President have made special arrangements so affected employees will not be left without coverage with their chosen physicians, even if a new contract is not negotiated.<br>
  <br>
  Should the contract between Sutter Health/Santa Cruz Medical Clinic and Health Net be terminated, Health Net members enrolled with the Santa Cruz Medical Clinic will be provided with a special enrollment period to choose another health plan.<br>
  <br>
  Health Net members who are enrolled with the Santa Cruz Medical Clinic and wish to remain in Health Net do not need to take any special action. If a special enrollment period is necessary, details will be published in a future issue of <i>Benefits Update,</i> and eligible Health Net members (those enrolled with Santa Cruz Medical Clinic) will receive a notice at their home address. Watch future issues of <i>Benefits Update</i> for additional information.

<p>
  The news of the assassination of John F. Kennedy is a touchstone memory for most Americans, who can vividly remember where they were, what they were wearing, and who they were with when they heard the news. One small group of Americans has another touchstone memory, one that invaded their personal lives in an even more disturbing way. They are red diaper babies--the children of American communists--whose young worlds were shook with the execution of Ethel and Julius Rosenberg in 1953. After all, the Rosenbergs, guilty or not, could have been their parents.
</p>The experiences of many of those children have been recorded in their own words in <i>Red Diapers</i> (University of Illinois Press).The book, edited by Judy Kaplan and Linn Shapiro, features contributions from people ranging in age from their early 20s to mid-80s, including three UCSC professors--David Wellman, Bettina Aptheker, and Marge Frantz. Among the other contributors are former <i>Washington Post</i> reporter Carl Bernstein and Robert Meeropol, one of the Rosenbergs' two sons.<br>
<br>
In his essay, Wellman, a professor of community studies, writes, "For communist kids, whose parents were publicly identified as enemies of the state, minor transgressions could be cause for major alarm. I lived in mortal fear that, no matter how petty, my violations of 1950s morality would make me responsible for my mother being deported or my father going to jail."<br>
<br>
Wellman's father, Saul, was a leader in the Michigan Communist Party and his mother, Peggy was an active member as well. When Wellman was a boy, his father went underground for two years before being caught and jailed. During his father's period of hiding, the Wellman family was the focus of intense FBI surveillance.<br>
<br>
But even before his father became a fugitive, Wellman notes that there was a sensibility in his family of the lack of tolerance they faced as communists. Growing up in Detroit, Michigan, in the 1950s, Wellman writes that his family "devoted considerable energy to fitting in." Wellman and his sister, Vicki, conformed so well, in fact, that they received the American Legion Award for "Americanism" in junior high. Although the media found irony in this, Wellman says his parents saw communism and American patriotism as perfectly compatible. His father was a war hero and his mother a Canadian immigrant. They were proud of their children for being model citizens.<br>
<br>
Despite their upright behavior, the Wellmans became the target of government scrutiny. For several years, no matter where they went--school, sandlot baseball games, birthday parties--the Wellman kids could count on being shadowed by what Wellman describes as "two conspicuous men pretending to be inconspicuous." Because of phone tapping and bugs, the children learned never to say anyone's name over the phone and to go outside if something important needed to be discussed.<br>
<br>
Some two years after going underground, Saul Wellman appeared on the front pages of the papers one day, pictured in chains in the custody of federal marshals. "He was charged with conspiring to 'teach and advocate' the violent overthrow of the United States government," Wellman says. "'Teach and advocate,' not act. He was being jailed for speaking, for thinking. In a very real sense it was an attack on the First Amendment." For years, Wellman says, "We lived in terror of losing both our parents." It seemed the children's nightmare might prove true when, two months after their father's arrest, their mother, Peggy, was also arrested and faced deportation. Although the family's attorney found a loophole that allowed their mother to stay, Wellman says that she had to report to the INS once a month until the day she died.<br>
<br>
Much of Wellman's piece focuses on the Red Squad files--surveillance reports of the Detroit Police. After the years of intensive scrutiny he experienced, Wellman was shocked to find that his file revealed no insidious activities. Among the entries: "4-9-55: Subject attended a concert featuring Pete Seeger."<br>
<br>
What Wellman concludes after seeing this report is that the government was not engaged in surveillance. "It was intimidation," he says. "The U.S. government constantly presented the Soviet Union as this terrible totalitarian state, but it was completely unrecognized how totalitarian this country had become. They were totally involved with and dominating the lives of a whole sector of people."<br>
<br>
For Aptheker, a professor of women's studies and history, growing up with communist parents in Brooklyn, N.Y., in the 1940s and 50s was a very different experience from that of Wellman. Although her father, historian Herbert Aptheker, was blacklisted in 1938, the impacts on her childhood were more subtle, but not less substantial. Most significantly, her father, a brilliant historian with a degree from Columbia University, was unable to get a job after the blacklisting.<br>
<br>
When Aptheker's father was called to testify before the McCarthy Senate committee she was seven. Seeing her father on television at her friend's house, Aptheker was excited and proud. But her friend's parents became suddenly cold, turned the TV off, and sent Aptheker home. After that her friend was forbidden to play with her anymore.<br>
<br>
When the Rosenbergs were executed Aptheker was nine. The incident upset her relatively stable life. Her mother told Aptheker that her parents were communists and that she must never share this secret with anyone. The event hit close to home for Aptheker, who played with the Rosenberg children, Michael and Robby. From then on she carried the burden of silence and fear common to so many red diaper babies.<br>
<br>
As a child, Aptheker never experienced the same kind of state scrutiny as Wellman. But in the 1960s, she did undergo intense FBI and Red Squad surveillance in Berkeley. She was a focus of surveillance both because of her parents' activism and her own political activity in the Berkeley Free Speech Movement, the antiwar movement, and the trial of Angela Davis.
<p>
  Aptheker says she was deeply influenced by her parents' morality and courage and joined the Communist Party herself as an adult. But as time progressed, she found herself out of step with party values. When the Soviet Union invaded Czechoslovakia, only Aptheker and two others in the 120-member national committee opposed the invasion.<br>
  <br>
  She also objected to the party's position on women's rights. "The party saw women's liberation only in terms of the workplace," she explains. "They had no position on domestic violence and there were huge debates on whether or not to support the Equal Rights Amendment." The party was also homophobic. When she began dating her girlfriend (who became her life partner), Aptheker says, "It was clear I was no longer welcome."<br>
  <br>
  Marge Frantz, a lecturer emerita of women's studies and American studies, grew up in the 1920s and '30s in the Alabama. Although party members were quite open about their affiliation in areas like New York, the Deep South was another story.<br>
  <br>
  In her essay, Frantz writes, "We lived dangerously." She recalls a time when her father tried to secure the release of a party member jailed for "possession of seditious literature." Her father was kidnapped, driven 50 miles out of town, stripped, and brutally beaten. Frantz also remembers death threats, a cross burning on her front lawn, and gunshots fired through the windows of her house.<br>
  <br>
  Although the political climate in the South was less tolerant of communism than in other regions, Frantz feels the time she grew up in was less oppressive.<br>
  <br>
  "I'm older than a lot of the people who wrote in the book. I lived through the struggles in the '30s and a lot of the people in the book were young kids in the '50s, in the McCarthy Era, and it was quite scary for them. A lot of parents didn't talk about their beliefs."<br>
  <br>
  Frantz, on the other hand, learned about communism from her parents and emulated their activism. During a yearlong stay in New York when she was 13, Frantz joined the National Student League and the Young Communist League at her high school. She organized events and produced leaflets.<br>
  <br>
  Among Frantz's positive memories of being in the movement is the music. "Our movement was a singing movement," she writes. "We didn't listen to others sing; we all sang together."<br>
  <br>
  One time, during a youth convention in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, Frantz heard a voice coming from one of the tents along the lake singing a song that her parents had written. "I couldn't believe my ears; I didn't know that anyone outside of Birmingham had ever heard that song. It's a ballad with a lot of verses and hadn't ended when I got to the tent and joined in. The tall, lanky singer sitting on the floor with his banjo was equally surprised. 'How do you know it?' he asked. 'My mom and dad wrote it. How do you know it?" 'I heard it in the Alan Lomax collection in the Library of Congress.' I didn't know Dad had recorded it. The balladeer turned out to be Pete Seeger, then unknown. Later, Pete came south and stayed with us while he collected more songs."<br>
  <br>
  Like Aptheker, neither Frantz or Wellman are members of the party today. Wellman never joined, finding the party platform too staid, and Frantz left when the Khrushchev report in 1956 brought to light the crimes of Stalinism. But, brought up with strong value for social justice, all three continue to be prominent activists.

<p>
  The world's most prolific team of planet hunters has found six new planets orbiting nearby stars, bringing the total number of planets astronomers have detected outside the solar system to 28. The researchers also found evidence suggesting that two previously discovered planets have additional companions, said Steven Vogt, UCSC professor of astronomy and astrophysics.
</p>Vogt and his colleagues, Geoffrey Marcy of UC Berkeley, Paul Butler of the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism at the Carnegie Institution of Washington in Washington, D.C., and Kevin Apps of the University of Sussex, England, made the discoveries using the "HIRES" spectrometer on the Keck I Telescope in Hawaii. Their findings will be published in the <i>Astrophysical Journal.</i><br>
<br>
The researchers have been using the facilities at the W. M. Keck Observatory for the past three years to conduct a survey of 500 nearby sunlike stars in search of planets. The project is supported by the NASA Origins Program, which has provided both funding and telescope time, and by the National Science Foundation.<br>
<br>
The six new planets increase by about 25 percent the number of known "extrasolar" planets, giving astronomers a substantial amount of additional information about planetary systems, Vogt said. One of the planets, HD 192263, was also recently detected by Nuno Santos and collaborators in Geneva, Switzerland, who reported it while Vogt and his colleagues were preparing their paper.<br>
<br>
The new planets orbit stars that are similar in size, age, and brightness to the Sun and are at distances ranging from 65 to 192 light-years from Earth. The planets themselves range in mass from slightly smaller to several times larger than the planet Jupiter (0.8 to 6.5 times the mass of Jupiter). They are probably also similar to Jupiter in their compositions--basically giant balls of hydrogen and helium gas, Vogt said.<br>
<br>
The presence of a planet around a star is indicated by a telltale wobble in the motion of the star as a result of the gravitational force exerted by the orbiting planet. Vogt and his coworkers recently achieved independent confirmation of this method for detecting planets when they were able to measure the dimming of a star as a planet passed in front of it.<br>
<br>
The orbits of the new planets, like those of most of the extrasolar planets discovered so far, tend to be quite eccentric, tracing paths that are oval rather than circular. One of the planets, around a star called HD 222582, has the most wildly eccentric orbit yet known, carrying it from as close as 0.39 astronomical units (AU: the distance from Earth to the Sun) to as far as 2.31 AU from its parent star in the course of its 576-day orbit.<br>
<br>
"It is beginning to look like neatly stacked, circular orbits such as we see in our own solar system are relatively rare," Vogt said.<br>
<br>
Interestingly, five of the six planets are located within the so-called "habitable zones" of their stars. This is the region where temperatures would allow water to exist in liquid form. Most of the extrasolar planets the researchers have studied have turned out to be outside the habitable zone, either too close to their star or too far away, and therefore too hot or too cold, Vogt said.<br>
<br>
"These planets are at just the right distance, with temperatures in one case around 108 degrees Fahrenheit--like a hot day in Sacramento," he said.<br>
<br>
Planetary systems with Jupiter-sized planets in oval-shaped orbits are not expected to harbor Earthlike planets, Vogt added. In fact, if an Earthlike planet were put into such a system, it would be quickly ejected by the gravitational influence of the Jupiter-mass planet. Vogt noted, however, that if these Jupiter-sized planets are similar to those in our own solar system, they probably have numerous moons associated with them.<br>
<br>
"For a planet in the habitable zone of its star, such moons offer the possibility of liquid water and the eventual emergence of life," he said.<br>
<br>
In addition to the discovery of six new planets, the researchers gathered new data on four previously known planets. Two of them, around the stars HD 217107 and HD 187123, showed long-term trends in their orbits indicating the presence of an additional companion. These companions, which may be planets or larger objects (e.g., brown dwarfs), appear to be orbiting their host stars in a long period, taking at least two to three years to complete an orbit, Vogt said. These findings are significant because previously only one other system of multiple planets, around the star Upsilon Andromedae, had been identified.<br>
<br>
"It will take years of additional observations to work out the orbits of these companions, but the evidence suggests there are a fair number of multiple planet systems out there," Vogt said.<br>

<p>
  The Biology Department is inviting members of the Santa Cruz community to spend "An Evening at the Microscope" on Sunday, December 12. Department staff will guide participants in observing a variety of fascinating specimens through high-quality microscopes. This free public event will be held from 6:30 to 8:30 p.m. in the Kenneth V. Thimann Laboratories Building, Room 239. The event is limited to 20 participants and may not be appropriate for children under 14.
</p>There will be a brief introduction to use of the instruments, after which participants will use stereoscopic microscopes to examine items congenial to their own interests.<br>
<br>
A variety of materials will be available for viewing, and participants are encouraged to bring their own specimens (bugs, flowers, small rocks, etc.) to share. There will also be an opportunity to create permanent images of the specimens.<br>
<br>
This event may be of particular interest to local kindergarten through 12th grade (K-12) science teachers, students with science fair projects involving microscopy, and those considering the purchase of their own microscope.
<p>
  Although the event is free to the public, voluntary donations will be gratefully accepted. Any contributions will be used to directly support UCSC's efforts to enhance science instruction in local K-12 schools.<br>
  <br>
  To reserve a space, or for more information, contact <a href="mailto:dalbey@biology.ucsc.edu">Mike Dalbey</a> at (831) 459-3674. Information is also available on the Web site of the <a href="http://www.biology.ucsc.edu/pubedu">Biology Department</a>.

  When technical director Joe Weiss shows groups of young schoolchildren around the campus's theater arts facilities, he often sees "little lightbulbs going off" as they grasp the wonder and magic of theater. "Because kids don't get introduced to theater and music in school as much as they used to, just exposing them to an artistic outlet that's greater than what they've seen is important," said Weiss. "Plus, I love kids."
</p>Weiss has hosted numerous local school groups through educational outreach programs, so it wasn't a reach for him to get involved in the latest outgrowth of the <i>Kids Around the University</i> program in which a group of fourth graders from Aromas School visited the campus and wrote a book for their peers about college. That book, and an accompanying curriculum guide, has been used to give more than 5,000 students a solid vision of what college is all about--and what they need to do to prepare for college.<br>

Dubbed Kids on Campus, the new program is bringing more than 1,000 students in grades four through eight to UCSC this year, introducing them to the academic and social aspects of college life. It's all part of UCSC's ongoing efforts to make college a goal for all young people in the area, said KATU project leader Katy Stonebloom.<br>
<br>
"I'm having to turn away schools and classrooms right now because there's such a need for this kind of program," said Stonebloom, who is working closely with ten schools in four counties to prepare students for their visit to the university.<br>
<br>
The students break into small groups of eight to ten kids before they head out for their prearranged campus appointments with UCSC students, faculty, staff, and administrators. The idea is to expose the children to all aspects of university life, said Stonebloom, who is always recruiting campus participants who can spare "just a tiny block of their time." Sometimes, she catches profs on the fly.<br>
<br>
"We ambushed (associate professor of biology) Martha Zuniga in the hallway one day, and she did an impromptu presentation," said Stonebloom.<br>
<br>
Typically, visits are scheduled in advance. So far, facilities the kids have toured include campus laboratories, art studios, libraries, and music rooms. "Any time someone says 'Oh, the kids should see this,' they're probably right," said Stonebloom. "Kids are really interested in the behind-the-scenes things that make the university work. No matter how obscure you think your job is, there's a kid who wants to know about it."<br>
<br>
Some stops are particularly captivating, said Stonebloom, recalling a tour last spring of the Anthropology Department's laboratory during which lab manager Richard Baldwin asked the kids if they wanted to see a human brain.<br>
<br>
"They all said 'Yes!,' and before I knew it, he'd unzipped the cadaver bag, flipped back the face and pulled the brain right out," said Stonebloom. "They loved it. I'll never forget one of the girls saying in Spanish, with complete awe, 'Look, there are all his memories.' It was a wonderful moment."<br>
<br>
As part of their preparation, the children draft interview questions for their subjects, and they take notes during their visit. "They are expected to share the information they gather with their school when they return," explained Stonebloom. "They have a mission, and they are very serious."<br>
<br>
During a recent interview with Martin Chemers, dean of the Social Sciences Division, youngsters from Starlight Elementary School in Watsonville quickly found common ground with their subject.<br>
<br>
"I told them that my grandparents were immigrants to America and mentioned that they came from Russia," said Chemers. "It turned out that they were reading a book about Russian Jewish immigrants in their classroom curriculum. It was a great connection."<br>
<br>
John Schechter, an associate professor of music, enjoys meeting the children and telling them about the life of a university professor.<br>
<br>
"I show them what a professor does and that it's not an impossible dream for them to have," said Schechter. "I tell them that if they do their work, go to school, and are conscientious, they can be a professor at a university, if that's what they wish."<br>
<br>
Schechter has hosted three or four school groups. "They're very well-behaved," he said, noting that he usually shows the kids how to play an Andean panpipe and then passes it around for them to try.<br>
<br>
Bruce Tanner, a staff research associate in the Earth Sciences Department, has fun demonstrating a technique geologists use to study rocks, which he calls "The Julia Child School of Thin Section Making."<br>
<br>
"There are always a few kids who are really fascinated by the whole thing," he said. "Who knows, we might get a few geologists out of this."<br>
<br>
The children get a real thrill out of the visits. "Kids remember the personal connections they make with students and professors," said Stonebloom. "They want to know who their teachers will be--they want to talk to you."<br>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_9077" align="alignright" width="200"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/1999/12/secondharvest.99-12-06.200.gif"><img class="size-full wp-image-9077" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/1999/12/secondharvest.99-12-06.200.gif" alt="" width="200" height="126" /></a>[/caption]
<p>
  This holiday season, Second Harvest Food Bank of Santa Cruz and San Benito Counties is asking the UCSC community to help "fill the bus" with donations of food. Second Harvest provides food to human service agencies and programs, which then distribute the goods to low-income seniors, people with AIDS, homeless people, single parents, abused women and children, disabled people, and individuals and families facing crisis situations.
</p>Bags with a list of the most-needed items will be sent to all campus mailboxes. Please fill your bag with suggested food items. Campus Mail Services has volunteered to collect the bags from December 6 to 10 and deliver them on December 10 to a bus provided by Santa Cruz Metro Transit.
<p>
  In addition, you can drop off your grocery bags at the base of campus from December 6 to 10 from 7:15 to 9:15 A.M. A Mail Services truck will be at the parking lot of the Granary Child Development Center at the UCSC main entrance.
</p>
<p>
  Cash donations will also be accepted. For every donated dollar, Second Harvest distributes more than $10 worth of food. Make your check out to Second Harvest Food Bank with a note stating "UCSC Food Drive." Send it via Campus Mail to UCSC Food Drive.
</p>
<p>
  Sigma Omicron Pi and Pi Alpha Phi have helped out tremendously. They have collected four barrels of donated food at Safeway on Mission Street; they went door-to-door at campus apartments, asking for food that students won't be able to eat over the holiday break; and they stapled thousands of pamphlets onto the grocery bags that were mailed to staff and faculty.
</p>
<p>
  The major sponsors of the food drive are Coast Commercial Bank, Driscoll Strawberry Associates, Granite Construction Company, Lockheed Martin Corporation, SCO, Seagate Technology, and Plantronics Inc.
</p>

        <title>Regents approve 2000-01 budget proposal investing in opportunity and quality</title>

        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  The University of California Board of Regents in mid-November adopted a 2000-01 budget plan that aims to provide educational opportunity for 6,000 new "Tidal Wave II" students, strengthen undergraduate education, boost faculty and staff salaries to help maintain quality programs, and invest in core needs such as instructional technology and building maintenance. The plan also includes initiatives to enhance UC's student outreach and K-12 academic improvement programs and to fund research in several areas important to the state's economy. "This is a plan to sustain excellence in the university's teaching, research and public service programs," said UC President Richard C. Atkinson. "It is a budget that keeps our doors open to all UC-eligible high school graduates in California, invests in quality educational programs for them and reaches out to the students in our public schools." The budget plan serves as UC's annual funding request to the governor and legislature. Final university spending decisions for the 2000-01 fiscal year will be made after the governor and legislature complete the state budget process next year. UC's state-funded budget would rise 6.7 percent to $2.9 billion under the budget plan. When UC general funds and student fee income are included, the university's basic budget increase would be 7 percent, or $253 million. The budget requests funding for an enrollment increase of 4 percent, or 6,000 students, in 2000-01. These are some of the 63,000 additional students UC expects to enroll by 2010 as the children of the Baby Boomers -- often referred to as "Tidal Wave II" -- reach college age and seek admission to the university. UC is pursuing a range of strategies for accommodating this 43 percent enrollment increase while continuing to provide high-quality educational programs. In its 2000-01 budget proposal, in fact, UC is seeking $6 million in new funding to strengthen the quality of undergraduate education. Campuses could use the funding to reduce class sizes, offer additional lower-division seminars, provide more undergraduate research opportunities, and offer more academic advising, among other things. UC's goal is to expand this effort annually and eventually devote $50 million per year to it. The budget plan assumes that funding equivalent to a 4.5 percent increase in mandatory systemwide student fees will be available, and that one-third of the increase will be devoted to financial aid. Mandatory systemwide student fees would not be increased, however, if the state provides equivalent funding. The state has provided that funding in each of the last five years and also has provided funds in the last two years to reduce fees 10 percent for resident undergraduates and 5 percent for resident graduate academic students. The plan requests funding for an average 2 percent salary increase for eligible UC employees, along with funding for regular merit increases and an 8 percent increase in employee health benefit costs. Funding also is requested to keep faculty salaries competitive with those of UC's comparison institutions and to continue to provide market-based parity adjustments to cooperative extension specialists and information technology employees. Distribution of salary increases varies by compensation program and is subject to collective bargaining requirements. UC's budget plan also boosts funding for building maintenance, instructional technology, instructional equipment and libraries -- areas suffering from chronic budget shortfalls. Funding for UC's student outreach and K-12 academic improvement programs has expanded dramatically in recent years, and the 2000-01 budget would continue approximately $180 million in funding from all sources for these efforts. If state resources are available, UC will propose a $6 million augmentation, focusing on increasing community college transfers to UC, encouraging more students from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds to enroll in graduate and professional school, providing professional development to teachers of algebra, and expanding research into the challenges of access to higher education. Other UC-proposed initiatives beyond the basic budget plan include development of an off-campus center to serve students in the Santa Clara Valley; several research initiatives in areas of high priority for the state, including engineering and computer science, environmental science, and collaborative research with Mexican scholars on U.S.-Mexico issues; and expansion of the California Digital Library, Cooperative Extension programs and access to Internet2, the next-generation, high-speed electronic highway. A separate capital improvements budget adopted by the board includes $213 million for construction, renovation and seismic-renewal projects at UC. The plan includes $14.3 million for initial site development and infrastructure at UC Merced, along with preliminary planning of the first two academic buildings there. The new campus is slated to open in 2005.

        <title>Chancellor Greenwood fields staff questions at brown-bag lunch</title>

        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  In the latest session of what she promised will be an ongoing dialogue with staff, Chancellor M.R.C Greenwood fielded questions about wages, workload, and union representation during a brown-bag lunch last week. The campus "is beginning to grow again," Greenwood told the crowd of nearly 200 people that turned out for the event in Classroom Unit 2. With that growth will come "opportunities for new staff programs and facilities we were on the verge of getting ten years ago." It will also bring change and inconvenience, she said, asking for patience and understanding as staff experience the hassles caused by campus construction and long-overdue maintenance projects. "This university is a work in progress," said Greenwood. "It's a wonderful institution, in large part because of the devotion many of you have given it over the years." Most of the 50-minute session was spent with Greenwood answering questions from the audience. Staff concerns ranged from working conditions and compensation to the lack of fitness programs available at the West Field House. Responding to questions about union representation on campus, Greenwood reiterated her desire for good working relationships between union members and management and conceded that she thought it took "an absurdly long time" to get the tentative agreement recently reached for technical employees. "I would like us to do much better than we have done in the past as far as understanding the objectives of unions and university management, which I think are often not all that different," said Greenwood, adding that both sides share an interest in creating a stable campus environment and supporting the goals of higher education. Julia Armstrong-Zwart, assistant chancellor for human resources, noted that there are "ways to structure conversations that wouldn't cross the line," referring to constraints Greenwood faces during negotiations that prohibit her from talking with members of represented groups. "We need to identify the common areas of concern that unite us, and I think we have to learn better how to disagree respectfully," said Armstrong-Zwart. During the discussion, Greenwood noted that staff concerns mirror faculty concerns: compensation, child care, the cost of living in Santa Cruz, and a climate of respect within the university. On the compensation front, several staff members said UCSC is no longer competitive in their fields. "When I first came to work here, we were the best employer in the county, and that's no longer the case," said word-processing specialist Zoe Sodja, asserting that Cabrillo College and Santa Cruz County offer higher salaries for comparable jobs. While salary surveys indicate that UCSC staff salaries are largely in line with those offered in northern California, in some occupational areas UCSC is above or below the market, according to compensation manager Judith Martin-Hoyt. Greenwood encouraged staff to consider their total compensation package, including health care and retirement, when making such comparisons. "We have no interest on this campus in being unfair," she said. About 25 percent of UCSC employees received salary increases of 8 to 9 percent last year as a result of reclassifications, equity increases, or promotions through open recruitment. While fund-raising is under way to build a new child care center on campus, the cost of housing is a problem that transcends the campus boundaries, said Greenwood. "What are we going to do in this housing market?" she asked. "Our new faculty are moving to Salinas because they can't afford to live in Santa Cruz, and the same thing is happening to faculty at UC Berkeley and UCLA, and staff have similar problems." Greenwood promised to explore the possibility of building housing for staff on campus, as well as more housing for faculty, and to pursue talks with the city about reserving some units of proposed new, affordable housing in town for UCSC staff. But she said it may be up to the state to take the initiative and solve the housing problem for some UC employees. Workload discussions focused on the campus's plans to hire additional staff as the campus grows to an enrollment of 15,000 students. Armstrong-Zwart acknowledged that "until this last year, we weren't planning for more resources." "As for staff planning, we don't do it very well," said Armstrong-Zwart. "In a lot of areas, we don't have a good tool for determining the impact of increasing student enrollments, but we'll have to develop new tools because at your desks, you feel the impact." Executive Vice Chancellor and Campus Provost John Simpson noted that his budget process, which rewards initiative and innovation, recognizes the impact of more students on staff and faculty, but he predicted that "we'll all end up doing our jobs better and enjoying them more" despite the monumental changes that lie ahead. Greenwood expressed a willingness to explore workstations as a possible factor contributing to the large number of workers' compensation claims filed by UCSC employees--the highest rate of claims by employees at any campus in the UC system, she noted. "It is true that one of the things we cut back on when things got tight was furniture renewal," said Greenwood. About 40 percent of UCSC's reported injuries are repetitive stress injuries, said Lisa Rose, director of materiel management and acting director of risk management. Responding to a question about alternative work schedules, Greenwood emphasized that such arrangements must be worked out between each individual employee and his or her supervisor. "We do try to encourage flexibility where that is possible, but it has to work for the individual and the institution," she said.
</p>

<p>
  Armstrong-Zwart noted that, "We can probably do a better job of communicating to managers and supervisors that it's okay to use alternative work schedules if they work."<br>
  <br>
  In a bid to promote the overall health and fitness of UCSC staff, Dan Wood, director of physical education, recreation, and sports, encouraged supervisors to support their employees' fitness efforts by approving flexible schedules that "allow for workouts as long as their jobs get done."

<p>
  By a razor-thin margin on Friday, UC Santa Cruz's Academic Senate postponed a vote on the campus's Narrative Evaluation System at a meeting that attracted approximately 1,000 student supporters of the long-standing practice.
</p>With chair Roger Anderson casting the tie-breaking vote, the senate moved the matter to its Committee on Educational Policy (CEP) and Graduate Council for consideration. The vote, 80-79, drew cheers from students who squeezed into the Media Theater and a thunderous roar from those who listened to the proceedings on a speaker system outside.
<p>
  Anderson's vote provided a stunning conclusion to Friday's meeting. But senators on both sides of the issue said the debate will resume in the winter quarter. In fact, George Brown, CEP chair, urged his colleagues to give his committee a chance to continue assessing the 35-year-old staple of UCSC's grading system. He said a report on their work, begun earlier this quarter, could be forthcoming at the February 23 meeting of the senate and "detailed legislation" could be ready for consideration at the spring session.
</p>
<p>
  Friday's special meeting of the senate was prompted by a petition signed by more than 170 members of the senate who recommended that the campus's Narrative Evaluation System be replaced by the conventional UC grading system.<br>
  Not all of the signers expected the matter to become the subject of an end-of-quarter special meeting, however. Former senate chair Helene Moglen said she had signed the petition but hadn't intended for a decision on NES to be rendered "hastily." Several speakers echoed that theme, emphasizing that the matter deserves more consideration before the evaluation system is significantly changed or abolished.
</p>
<p>
  Others were inclined to vote for the anti-NES resolution on Friday. They argued that faculty could continue the discussion in smaller circles during the approximately two months it would take to circulate and tabulate a mail ballot.
</p>
<p>
  Such a ballot, which can be requested by as few as 25 faculty, is considered a near certainty in any important matter in which the vote is close at a senate meeting. Anderson said Friday's vote could also be challenged by a mail ballot, but the outcome of such a vote wouldn't significantly affect the timing of the next NES debate before the full senate; either way, the senate is expected to take up the matter again in February.
</p>
<p>
  Professor of biology Lincoln Taiz opened the anti-NES argument on Friday. The system, approved for UCSC's first year in 1965-66, was appropriate for the campus when it was a "small, liberal arts college," he said. But does the grading system work for a campus with 11,000 students that is projected to grow? Taiz asked. "For many of the faculty here today, the answer is a resounding 'no,'" he said.
</p>
<p>
  Students saw the matter quite differently. Student Union Assembly chair Kirti Srivastava said the undergraduate body had collected signatures from nearly 4,400 students in three days who "stand firm and united against this proposal and demand that a vote not be taken today."
</p>
<p>
  The members of UCSC's Alumni Council, the governing board for the Alumni Association, also weighed in, calling the proposal to do away with the NES a "rush to judgement."
</p>
<p>
  "We fail to understand why this proposal should not go through a formal, consultative, deliberate process that can give it the scrutiny it warrants," the association said in a letter read by alumnus John Wilkes, director of UCSC's Science Communication Program.
</p>
<p>
  The resolution before the senate on Friday called for UCSC to implement the following features of the University of California's grading system:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Grades A-F, including plus and minus suffixes for grades A-D.
  </li>
  <li>An option for students to take up to one-third of total course units on a Pass/No Pass basis.
  </li>
  <li>An option for departments to require that courses applied toward credit in a major be taken on a letter-grade basis.
  </li>
  <li>Grade points per unit, assigned as A=4, B=3, C=2, D=1, F=0. Minus grades would be assigned three-tenths grade point less per unit than unsuffixed grades; plus grades (except A+) would be assigned three-tenths grade point per unit.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  In a last-minute amendment to the resolution, supporters of the resolution added language that would have enabled faculty to opt to provide narratives in certain classes.
</p>
<p>
  The changes outlined in the resolution would have taken effect on September 1, 2001.
</p>
<p>
  The meeting on Friday marks the third time this decade that UCSC's long-standing Narrative Evaluation System (NES) has been the subject of an Academic Senate debate. In an informational action intended to guide NES deliberations by the senate's Committee on Educational Policy, senate members participated in a spirited debate in June 1993 before voting to maintain NES.
</p>
<p>
  In the fall of 1996, however, senate members voted by a two-to-one margin to permit new and continuing students to request letter grades for all classes, beginning in fall 1997. The change retained the NES, but enabled new students to accumulate a grade-point average. During this past academic year, approximately one-third of UCSC's students requested grades.

<p>
  Expected to serve and obey without question, often exploited as factory workers, indentured servants, or prostitutes, Chinese women who immigrated to America in the early 20th century were thought to not have any power over their own destiny. However, a new book by historian Judy Yung, which gives voice to the unheard stories of many of these women and their daughters, reveals lives lived with fortitude, resilience, and great strength of character.
</p>The book, titled <i>Unbound Voices: A Documentary History of Chinese Women in San Francisco</i> (UC Press), depicts the history of Chinese American women in a very moving and personal medium--their own words.<br>
<br>
Yung, an associate professor of American studies, tells two stories at once in her new book: the social history of Chinese women in San Francisco from the turn of the century through World War II and the personal tales of 40 Chinese American women. Yung's compelling history unfolds through oral histories, immigration interviews, newspaper articles, letters, poems, autobiographies, speeches, and other sources.<br>
<br>
<i>Unbound Voices,</i> a sequel to Yung's 1995 book, <i>Unbound Feet</i> (also published by UC Press), uses the same structure as its award-winning predecessor, beginning with the women who lived in China in the 19th century, progressing on to experiences of Chinese immigrant women in San Francisco in the early 1900s, and those of their second-generation daughters during the Great Depression and World War II.<br>
<br>
Yung's book is already being hailed by critics, who consider it an outstanding primary sourcebook for Asian American and women's studies. The book succeeds in presenting an insightful historical and socioeconomic picture of life for Chinese women in the first half of the 20th century that becomes vivid through the personal experiences of the women who lived during that time. "Just as with Unbound Feet, I try to interweave text and context so that this is not just a collection of voices," she explained.<br>
<br>
Yung thought that when she completed <i>Unbound Feet,</i> a ten-year project, she was done with the subject and would move on to something else. But, she said, "I couldn't put it to rest. I had all this rich material in the women's own voices crying to be heard. When I realized this might be the last time these stories will see the light of day, I decided to do the second volume."<br>
<br>
Yung herself was born in San Francisco to Chinese immigrants, and the accounts of her mother, Jew Law Ying, are a compelling part of the story. Like many women who came to the U.S. from China, Jew Law Ying came with bright expectations that were quickly dashed.<br>
<br>
"I cried a lot when I first came to Menlo Park," Jew Law Ying recalled in her oral history. "So this was what Gold Mountain was all about! So this was heaven! No bathtub, no icebox, a wood-burning stove, no hot water. I wanted to go back to China where we had servants to cook and to serve us, where I was happy eating my grandfather's food and wearing my grandfather's clothes. Here I had to do everything myself, including washing the laundry by hand and fetching the firewood. It was a sorrowful three years."<br>
<br>
Yung also included a section on Chinese proverbs that illustrate the prevailing attitudes toward women. Among them, "a woman without a husband is like a house without a roof beam"; "a woman without talent is virtuous"; and "one good wife guarantees three generations of good offspring." However, as Yung explained, "Women always found ways to circumvent these limited gender roles."<br>
<br>
Women of various ages and occupations are included in Yung's book, from the first wave of immigrants whose main concern was survival to later generations grappling with assimilation and racism. Eva Lowe told Yung of her attempts to find work during the Depression: "I saw an ad that said they wanted to hire a seamstress on Third Street. I remember I went over there and asked for the job. I had that ad from the newspaper and she said, 'We don't hire Orientals.' Not Chinese, but Orientals. I said, 'You have that ad there." She told me, 'Well, I don't mind, but I don't think the workers would be willing to work with you.' Now you cannot say that. You'll be sued, right?"<br>
<br>
A firsthand account from a missionary journal depicts another common story. A daughter sold by her parents (in this case for $450 Mexican dollars), Wong Ah So was brought to America as a wife and then sold into prostitution. She was eventually rescued by Donaldina Cameron of the Presbyterian Mission Home in San Francisco and agreed to marry a Chinese merchant in Boise, Idaho. As interesting as her own story is, so is the perspective Yung added on how Wong Ah So's attitude changed over time, from complete acceptance and obedience to her parents and owners to a willingness later on to challenge her husband's patriarchal values.<br>
<br>
A former librarian, Yung is meticulous in her research, which represents years spent in libraries, archives, and the homes of the women she interviewed. Yung provided brief introductions to each story for context but is careful to let the women speak for themselves.<br>
<br>
"We mediate so much as historians, trying to put words in people's mouth, unknowingly influenced by our own biases and agendas. But I have all this rich primary material. Why not let the women tell their own stories in their own words?"<br>
<br>
Yung will present a booksigning and reading on Thursday, January 6, at 7:30 p.m. at the Capitola Book Cafe. For information on the reading, call (831) 462-4415.

        <title>Y2K: prepare for winter quarter now</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 22 Nov 1999 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>9072</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  So, with one month to go before the calendar turns to Year 2000, exactly how Y2K-safe is the campus? Staff who have studied the issue--as well as the hundreds of thousands of lines of the computer code that drive operating systems, applications, and files--believe that all of the campus's primary computer systems will be up and fully functional on January 1.
</p>

<p>
  To be on the safe side, however, a small corps of UCSC employees will be on campus during the first weekend of the New Year, assessing the campus's power grid and testing UCSC's mission-critical computer systems.
</p>

<p>
  As an additional backup, units that oversee such systems as the Student Information System, the Payroll-Personnel System, and the Financial Information System have developed contingency plans that will enable the campus to do business even if there are failures.
</p>

<p>
  UCSC's Y2K Task Force is also reminding students, faculty, and staff to take a few steps to help ensure UCSC's smooth transition to the New Year:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Students should remember to complete enrollment for winter classes (via phone or Web) by the end of open enrollment on December 15, make a printout of their winter 2000 class schedule before leaving for the holiday season, and pay registration fees by the December 15 deadline.
  </li>
  <li>Some faculty, staff, and students should also check in to make sure that the campus didn't sustain any major Y2K-related power problems before returning to campus for the beginning of the winter quarter on Monday, January 3.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Specifically, students who live on campus but will be out of the area in the days leading up to January 3 are asked to call <b>459-INFO</b> or visit UCSC's Y2K Web site (<a href="http://y2k.ucsc.edu">y2k.ucsc.edu</a>) between midmorning on Saturday, January 1, and their scheduled return time. Employees who live out of the Santa Cruz area (and may not know of any local power problems) are asked to do likewise.
</p>

<p>
  The Y2K Web site also contains other related resources, including an informational flyer that students, faculty, and staff may print and keep in their possession over the holiday break. Contingency plans that would be in effect should the campus experience significant Y2K-related system failures are also available at the Web site.
</p>

<p>
  KZSC radio (88.1 FM) will also carry reports of the campus's Y2K health during the first weekend of the New Year.
</p>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  UC Office of the President The University of California and the University Professional and Technical Employees-Communications Workers of America (UPTE-CWA) reached tentative agreement in early November on wages and other reopened contract articles for 4,000 technical employees at UC. For technical unit employees on UC campuses, the tentative agreement includes a 2 percent retroactive range increase for 1998-99 and 1999-2000. Most technical unit employees will receive a 2 percent across-the-board retroactive salary increase each year. Employees in certain technical unit classifications will also receive a lump-sum signing bonus. For technical unit employees at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, the merit system will be continued, with a 4 percent merit pool for 1998-99 and a 3.5 percent merit pool for 1999-2000. The agreement includes other compensation adjustments for certain classifications and some minor changes to other contract articles. Employees in the technical unit include laboratory assistants, computer resource specialists and animal technicians, among others. The initial contract for the technical unit took effect in 1997, and the tentative agreement will extend it until September 2000. Negotiations between the university and the union have centered on reopened articles of the contract. Technical unit employees and university representatives must ratify the tentative agreement before it can be implemented. That process is expected to be completed by the end of November. Prospective pay increases will be distributed within 60 days of the first pay period following ratification, and retroactive increases will be paid within 120 days of the first pay period following ratification.

<h4>
  <font color="#003399">Meningitis vaccine</font>
</h4>

<p>
  Over the past decade there has been a rising incidence of outbreaks of meningitis reported on college campuses. This has prompted the American College Health Association (ACHA) to recommend that college students "consider vaccination to reduce their risk for potentially fatal meningococcal disease." There is a vaccine available against meningococcal disease that is 85 percent effective against many, but not all, of the subgroups of meningococcal bacteria. The Student Health Service is following the ACHA recommendation of making vaccination and information available to students. Students can make an appointment for vaccination by calling (831) 459-2500. Immunization costs $65, plus the injection fee. Most health insurance, including the campus undergraduate and graduate plans, does not cover the cost of this preventive measure, but charges can be billed to the student's university account. For more information on meningococcal disease, go to the <a href="http://www.acha.org/special-prj/men.htm">American College Health Association Web site.</a>

        <title>Santa Clara Valley regional center discussed at forum</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 22 Nov 1999 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>9069</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  As the academic planning process gets under way to establish a UCSC regional center in the Santa Clara Valley, faculty and administrators are working together to embrace the opportunities and address the challenges that face the campus as it seeks to become the "UC of Silicon Valley." During a mid-November Academic Senate forum on the regional center, Executive Vice Chancellor and Campus Provost John Simpson announced the formation of an academic planning committee that will develop a framework for the academic activities associated with the center. Simpson has asked the senate's Committee on Committees to recommend faculty members to participate on the academic planning task force. Simpson made his remarks during the forum, which was attended by about 75 members of the campus community. Academic Senate Chair Roger Anderson, a chemistry professor, called the forum to facilitate discussion about plans for the regional center. Anderson and Simpson were joined by six other panelists, including Manuel Pastor, chair of Latin American and Latino studies. Plans for the new UCSC facility have progressed since the idea was first proposed by members of the Millennium Committee. Since then, a task force cochaired by Pastor and Francisco Hernandez, vice chancellor for student affairs, has assessed UCSC activities in the region with an eye toward building on strengths and satisfying unmet needs. A regional center would augment and enhance the offerings of the main campus by offering research, teaching, and community service opportunities for UCSC faculty, students, and staff, while also raising UCSC's profile in the region. A site analysis is under way. "One of our responsibilities as a UC campus is to provide leadership and to share our resources with the community," said Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood. "In Silicon Valley, what we have to offer complements alliances and affiliations that will be valuable for faculty, researchers, and students." During the forum, Pastor expressed strong support for a regional center, calling Silicon Valley "the hyperactive edge of the new economy." In addition to obvious benefits to the fields of technology and engineering, the region offers tremendous opportunities for those in the arts, humanities, and social scientists, said Pastor, citing the region's vibrant economy, its diverse population, the valley's revitalized labor movement, pressing social problems associated with a widening divide between the wealthy and the working class, and new digital arts technology--even a generation of new writers emerging from Silicon Valley. Raising UCSC's profile over the hill will also help the campus attract more of the region's top high school graduates and would bolster existing outreach efforts, helping to increase the diversity of the student body at UCSC, said Hernandez. The Santa Clara County region is home to numerous high schools and community colleges whose graduates would be poised to take advantage of UCSC classes offered in the area. A regional center would help UCSC accommodate its share of "Tidal Wave II" students who will soon flood the UC system. Recent reports suggest that UC's systemwide enrollment will surge by 40 percent in the next decade. Even with the new Merced campus, each campus will need to increase enrollment to accommodate this anticipated growth. A regional center would likely serve a greater number of "commuter" students and working professionals than UCSC currently accommodates, according to Connie Martinez, UCSC's director of strategic initiatives, who is coordinating the planning effort. "We have deep roots in the community through extension's work," said Martinez, former vice president of Joint Venture: Silicon Valley Network, a nonprofit group established to enhance the economic vitality and quality of life in the Silicon Valley. "We want to make the transition to the university easier and more inviting." In addition to raising the profile of UCSC in a vital region of the state, a regional center would facilitate outreach and teacher preparation work being done through the UCSC Educational Partnership Center and the New Teacher Center, and it would help solidify the campus's relationships with industry, government, and community organizations over the hill. Such affiliations would help UCSC in its mission of educating the workforce of the 21st century. At the forum, Martinez, who has conducted dozens of interviews with UCSC faculty and administrators in recent months, said she has identified widespread support for the research, educational, recruitment, and fund raising opportunities that exist for UCSC in the Santa Clara Valley area, including a strong desire to improve the campus's reputation in the region. Her meetings with campus members also revealed challenges, including concern that:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The speed of the planning process will move ahead too quickly and quality will be sacrificed, or too slowly and opportunities will be missed.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>The faculty will be divided, physically and philosophically; ladder faculty won't want to drive over the hill; and "nonentrepreneurial" faculty will be left behind.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>The range of opportunities will dilute the focus of the project.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Resources will be insufficient or diverted from the main campus.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Industry partnerships could compromise academic freedom.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Offerings will not meet UCSC standards; academic oversight will be inadequate; cultural differences between Silicon Valley and Santa Cruz will preclude successful research partnerships.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Opportunities for development, outreach, and lifelong learning will distract from UCSC's commitment to undergraduate education.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>UCSC's efforts will duplicate what Cal State University and community colleges do best.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Short-term thinking will preclude a full understanding of the scope of the endeavor.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Martinez has identified "critical success factors" that will help increase the probability of success, including focus, timing, involvement, incentives, and communication.<br>
  <br>
  "Like it or hate it, Silicon Valley is filled with tremendous challenges and opportunities," Martinez told the gathering. "But all sectors--industry, education, community, and government, agree that the number one issue in the region is education."<br>
  <br>
  George Brown, chair of the Physics Department and speaking as the chair of the Academic Senate's Committee on Educational Policy, said a regional center could play an important role in helping community college transfer students make the transition to a four-year institution. He also encouraged faculty members to consult with colleagues at other institutions to explore models for economic and pedagogical relationships between "parent" campuses and "satellite" operations.<br>
  <br>
  Physics professor David Belanger, speaking as the chair of the Graduate Council of the Academic Senate, cautioned that a regional center without a research component would be a "second-class campus" and would tarnish UCSC's reputation. Eager to bolster UCSC's graduate enrollments, Belanger said a highly visible Santa Clara center could help attract graduate students to UCSC in fields such as digital arts, adaptive optics, economics, ethics, and many more.<br>
  <br>
  Belanger and others said "an excellent transportation system" between UCSC and the regional center would help create an "integrated intellectual community."<br>
  <br>
  Alison Galloway, an associate professor of anthropology representing the Academic Senate's Committee on Planning and Budget, expressed concern about "a lack of clarity about who will be served" by a regional center, saying that "you can't plan academic programs without some of these answers."<br>
  <br>
  Galloway urged Simpson's academic planning task force to identify precisely what students would be served and what their specific course needs would be, and she sought assurances "beyond the tenure of the present administration" that funding for the center would not be taken from the main campus's budget.<br>
  <br>
  Simpson acknowledged that many of the questions that had been raised were "entirely warranted, and I am doing what I can to allay those fears and get it right."<br>
  <br>
  Among supporters of the regional center who spoke in favor of the project, sociology professor Paul Lubeck cited existing research endeavors in the region and issues such as immigration that "bridge the humanities and social sciences."<br>
  <br>
  Anujan Varma, a professor of computer engineering, is enthusiastic about the research opportunities such a center could offer those in his field, which is networking.<br>
  <br>
  "A regional center would give the campus more exposure and allow us to do bigger things than what we're doing now," he said before the forum. Exposure is key to attracting funding opportunities, he noted. "For engineering, this is a matter of survival."<br>
  <br>
  Talk of a regional center has piqued the interest of some arts faculty, as well. Sharon Daniel, an assistant professor of film and digital media, is working with colleagues at seven other UC campuses to establish a multicampus research group and a systemwide Ph.D. program in digital arts. In an interview before the forum, Daniel said that a regional facility might serve as a hub for participating researchers and students, providing a valuable boost to those efforts while greatly expanding Daniel's own resources.<br>
  <br>
  "My own work requires high band-width communication infrastructure, as well as fast and flexible multidimensional database technology," she said. "I believe very strongly that artists should be involved in the design and creation of new technologies, not just as end users."<br>
  <br>
  Daniel conceded that there is some concern from advocates of traditional art practices about the resources required to pursue research and instruction in technology-based art practices, but she believes that new relationships made possible through a regional center in Silicon Valley present opportunities in which the university can interact "in relevant ways with what's happening in culture and society."<br>
  <br>
  "As the academy, we need to be actively engaged in new developments in the world, such as the design of new information and communication technologies that so profoundly shape our cultural and social experience," she said. "Through engaged participation, academics can be critical and help shape changing social and cultural conditions. I think I can make political and cultural change through participation as well as critical analysis. I think that faculty at a research university like UCSC should probably do both."<br>
  <br>
  In a sentiment articulated by several people at the forum, anthropology professor Shelly Errington said: "I think this is a very good idea with all kinds of opportunities. My concern is not about the content but the process. The Academic Senate as an organized body should have a say in the planning. A handpicked committee won't guarantee a high state of morale and enthusiasm on the part of faculty."<br>
  <br>
  Simpson credited the Millennium Committee with laying the groundwork for the regional center several years ago, and he noted that several other UC campuses envy UCSC's preparedness as it anticipates the upcoming enrollment boom. "Other campuses will follow our lead (planning regional facilities), and frankly, I'd like to keep that advantage," he said.<br>
  <br>
  A team is currently exploring possible sites for the center including sites in downtown San Jose and at the NASA/Ames Research Center at Moffett Field. A total of $2.5 million in seed funding for the center is included in President Atkinson's proposed university budget for 2000-01. Planners hope to announce the selection of a site by spring.<br>

        <title>Proposal to eliminate 'narratives' goes before Academic Senate</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 22 Nov 1999 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>9066</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  A petition signed by 170 members of the Academic Senate is recommending that the campus's Narrative Evaluation System be replaced by the conventional UC grading system. The full senate is scheduled to meet on Friday, December 3, at 3:30 p.m. in the campus's new Media Theater to consider a resolution that would do just that. (Located behind the Ticket Office, the Media Theater is also called room M110.)
</p>

<p>
  "The Narrative Evaluation System has an honorable history, but times have changed and a new approach to grading is required," the petitioners said. "A new approach will help us to attract and retain students with strong academic records, to maintain the integrity of our curricula, and to communicate the quality of our students accurately and concisely to graduate and professional schools and prospective employers."
</p>

<p>
  Specifically, the promoters of the change are asking that the following features of the University of California's grading system be implemented:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Grades A-F, including plus and minus suffixes for grades A-D.
  </li>
  <li>An option for students to take up to one-third of total course units on a Pass/No Pass basis.
  </li>
  <li>An option for departments to require that courses applied toward credit in a major be taken on a letter-grade basis.
  </li>
  <li>Grade points per unit, assigned as A=4, B=3, C=2, D=1, F=0. Minus grades would be assigned three-tenths grade point less per unit than unsuffixed grades; plus grades (except A+) would be assigned three-tenths grade point per unit.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  In short, the proposal would make grades, currently an option that students can choose in addition to receiving narrative evaluations for each quarter's work, the backbone of UCSC's student evaluation system.
</p>

<p>
  The changes outlined in the resolution would take effect on September 1, 2001. The Academic Senate currently lists 588 members, including emeriti faculty, who are eligible to vote on the resolution.
</p>

<p>
  The December 3 meeting marks the third time this decade that UCSC's long-standing Narrative Evaluation System (NES) has been the subject of an Academic Senate debate. In an informational action intended to guide NES deliberations by the senate's Committee on Educational Policy, senate members participated in a spirited debate in June 1993 before voting to maintain NES in its present form.
</p>

<p>
  In the fall of 1996, however, senate members voted by a two-to-one margin to permit new and continuing students to request letter grades for all classes, beginning in fall 1997. The change retained the NES, but enabled new students to accumulate a grade point average. During this past academic year, approximately one-third of UCSC's students requested grades.
</p>

<p>
  Opponents of both the 1993 and 1996 proposals argued that the changes would erode UCSC's tradition of emphasizing learning over grades.
</p>

<p>
  The December 3 meeting was called by Roger Anderson, chair, at the request of eighteen members of the senate; according to senate bylaws, a written request from at least ten members must be submitted before a special meeting can be called.

        <title>Search begins for 'missing' UC alumni</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 22 Nov 1999 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  UC Office of the President
</p>

<p>
  The University of California is looking high and low for some of its 238,000 "lost" alumni.<br>
  <br>
  "Our alumni are known for their independence, so I'm not surprised that they haven't left forwarding addresses. But they also are known for their commitment and support of social values, and the fact is that we need them now," explained James Stofan, director of alumni affairs for the University of California system.<br>
  <br>
  Tracking UC graduates is complicated because students attend UC campuses from various regions of the state, the country and the world.<br>
  <br>
  Finding the lost alumni could make a major difference in membership and annual giving income to the university. Records compiled in mid-1998 showed that the University of California had no forwarding address for 237,827 of its more than one million alumni.<br>
  <br>
  Stofan has hired a firm to help track down the missing alumni so that the UC graduates can be added to an all-UC database update project. "This amount of additional involvement could be critical as the university prepares to handle the expected 40 percent increase in students by the year 2010," he said.<br>
  <br>
  Stofan's office is coordinating the project in collaboration with UC's nine campus alumni associations. Individual campuses will determine alumni activities and special projects on their respective campuses.<br>
  <br>
  If you are a "lost" UC graduate and want to reconnect with your campus, please call (510) 987-9161 or e-mail your name and address to <a href="http://www.ucalumni.net">www.ucalumni.net</a>.<br>
  <br>
  Stofan explained that the Executive Marketing Services of Naperville, Il., has been selected to help find the alumni. A company representative estimates that it will take three to four weeks at each campus to find the UC graduates with searches running simultaneously. The goal is to have the addresses of the lost alumni in the database by early 2000.<br>

  Astronomer <b>Steven Vogt</b> was interviewed on KION (Channel 46) about his role in the first observation of a planet outside our solar system to be detected by measuring the dimming of its star as the planet passed in front of it. Vogt and his colleagues have used a different technique based on the gravitational effects of planets on their stars to detect more than 20 "extrasolar" planets. Their latest discovery was widely reported on television and in newspapers, including the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> and the <i>Santa Cruz County Sentinel,</i> although some of the articles mistakenly reported that the astronomers had actually photographed the planet (in fact, they only measured its dimming effect on the parent star).
</p>

<p>
  The latest national media to call on UCSC experts are CNN, which sent a crew to campus to interview <b>Manuel Pastor</b> about the "digital divide," and National Public Radio, which tapped psychology's <b>Craig Haney</b> for a segment about supermax prisons. Also, during a recent trip to Spain, Haney was interviewed by a European wire service reporter about the death penalty in the United States. . . . Closer to home, the <i>Cleveland Plain Dealer</i> called on sociology's <b>Monica Casper</b> to discuss fetal surgery.<br>
  <br>
  Geophysicist <b>Steven Ward's</b> research on the San Andreas fault is featured in an article in the December issue of <i>Scientific American</i> magazine. The article discusses an approach known as stress-transfer analysis, which Ward and other seismologists are using to gauge the likelihood of earthquakes by studying how different faults interact with one another.
</p>

<p>
  Author and literature professor <b>Louis Chude-Sokei</b> spoke with a reporter from the <i>Santa Cruz County Sentinel</i> for a story on a new book by Jamaica Kincaid. The book is about gardening from the eyes of indigenous people whose methods, plants, and names were co-opted by conquering cultures. Chude-Sokei talked about Kincaid's work and noted that another author, C.L.R. James, wrote on a similar tack using the game of cricket as his subject.<br>

<p>
  This holiday season, Second Harvest Food Bank of Santa Cruz and San Benito Counties is asking the UCSC community to help "fill the bus" with donations of food. Second Harvest provides food to human service agencies and programs, which then distribute the goods to low-income seniors, people with AIDS, homeless people, single parents, abused women and children, disabled people, and individuals and families facing crisis situations.
</p>Bags with a list of the most-needed items will be sent to all campus mailboxes. Please fill your bag with suggested food items. Campus Mail Services has volunteered to collect the bags from December 6 to 10 and deliver them on December 10 to a bus provided by Santa Cruz Metro Transit.
<p>
  In addition, you can drop off your grocery bags at the base of campus from December 6 to 10 from 7:15 to 9:15 A.M. A Mail Services truck will be at the parking lot of the Granary Child Developement Center at the UCSC East Entrance.
</p>
<p>
  Cash donations will also be accepted. For every donated dollar, Second Harvest distributes more than $10 worth of food. Make your check out to Second Harvest food bank with a note stating "UCSC Food Drive." Send it via Campus Mail to UCSC Food Drive.
</p>
<p>
  Sigma Omicron Pi and Pi Alpha Phi will also be selling peanut butter and jelly sandwiches to help the Second Harvest food drive. Donate $1 or bring two canned goods and receive a sandwich and a carton of milk. Sorority and fraternity members will be at various sites around the campus from November 29 to December 1 from 11 A.M. to 2 P.M. Marriott has provided the food for free.
</p>
<p>
  The Greek organizations have helped out tremendously in other ways, too. They have collected four barrels of donated food at Safeway on Mission Street; they went door-to-door at campus apartments, asking for food that students won't be able to eat over the holiday break; and they stapled thousands of pamphlets onto the grocery bags that were mailed to staff and faculty.
</p>
<p>
  The major sponsors of the food drive are Coast Commercial Bank, Driscoll Strawberry Associates, Granite Construction Company, Lockheed Martin Corporation, SCO, Seagate Technology, and Plantronics Inc.
</p>

<p>
  Seen one too many performances of the <i>Nutcracker?</i> Feel like Marley's ghost is your personal friend? This December 12, audiences are invited to enjoy something a little out of the ordinary when the critically acclaimed Mariachi Los Camperos de Nati Cano performs "Fiesta Navidad" at the Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium.
</p>Although the show features some of the most traditional and commonly practised Christmas celebrations of Mexico, it offers audiences the rare opportunity to see these works performed in a fully staged production by world-class musicians.<br>
<br>
Considered the world's preeminent mariachi band, Mariachi Los Camperos is widely recognized for taking the art of mariachi to a new level--from the cantina to the concert hall.
<p>
  For the past five years, the ensemble has toured its Christmas show to sold-out audiences around the U.S. and Mexico. The show was a highlight of Santa Cruz's holiday season three years ago, when the ensemble performed to a wildly enthusiastic audience of adults and children.<br>
  <br>
  Fiesta Navidad is a traditional holiday celebration in Mexico that incorporates music, dancing, and theater. Some of its traditions are ancient, having evolved from the winter feasts of indigenous Mexicans.
</p>
<p>
  Mariachi Los Camperos creates a fully staged show for its version, with elaborate sets, lighting, and sound. Along with the 12-member mariachi ensemble, "Fiesta Navidad" features the 20-member dance ensemble Ballet Folklorico Ollin.<br>
  <br>
  "The idea is to create the happiness of the fiesta and our traditions," explained Natividad "Nati" Cano, Mariachi Los Camperos's musical director for nearly four decades. The happiness is not only evident, it's contagious, as the stage overflows with the colorful costumes of Mexico, the exuberance of the folklorico dancers, and the virtuosity of the mariachi musicians.<br>
  <br>
  "Fiesta Navidad" opens with a re-creation of the traditional procession of La Posada, which originated in Mexico in the 16th century. The piece recalls Joseph and Mary's pilgrimage to Bethlehem--the couple travel from door to door asking for lodging, after many rejections they are finally invited into someone's home, a pinata is broken open, and the fiesta begins.
</p>
<p>
  Along with the music of La Posada, the ensemble performs a range of other traditional mariachi songs of regional Mexico and also turns its mariachi phrasing to such American holiday classics as "Campanitas" ("Jingle Bells"), "Aqui Viene (Here Comes) Santa Claus," and "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer."<br>
  <br>
  "Our performance is all mariachi," explained Cano. "I think audiences like to experience the tradition of another country. But," he added, "we want people to know there is more to mariachi than just 'La Bamba.' "<br>
  <br>
  And, by all reports, Cano has succeeded in that mission. The 66-year-old musician is widely credited for developing a broad multicultural audience for mariachi. It helps, of course, that the ensemble boasts some of the world's most gifted mariachi musicians, but it is Cano's passion and talent that have raised the art of mariachi to a higher level.
</p>
<p>
  His brilliant arrangements preserve traditional structures but add compelling and engaging new angles. "We have improved many of the arrangements," he said, "and added new rhythms and sounds, but in the end, this is true mariachi."<br>
  <br>
  Mariachi--which refers to the musician, the ensemble, or the music itself--has been in existence since at least the 1830s and originated in rural western Mexico. A mariachi ensemble is typically string based, with guitars and violins, and a harp or guitarron (a large bass guitar) featured. The accordion, trumpets, and other brass and woodwinds complete the ensemble.<br>
  <br>
  Although "Fiesta Navidad" is an important focus for Mariachi Los Camperos, the ensemble regularly performs mariachi in the Los Angeles area and on international tours (a performance at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., recently aired on PBS).
</p>
<p>
  The band has released five of their own recordings; the most recent, recorded in 1993, is <i>Canciones de Siempre.</i> They were one of four mariachi bands enlisted by Linda Ronstadt for her 1988 recording, <i>Canciones de Mi Padre.</i><br>
  <br>
  Cano holds Ronstadt in high regard. When it comes to the reverence of the art form, she is a kindred spirit. "When I was recording with her, I tried to adapt the music in a way that I thought matched her style," Cano recalled. "She said, 'No, no, no! I don't want that, I want your music.' She said, 'Hey, this music is beautiful. Let's not take it apart.' "<br>
  <br>
  For Cano, that is, perhaps, his ultimate mission--to preserve and enrich the music he loves. "We have this wonderful tradition to preserve. That doesn't mean we don't improve it, but we must keep it alive. This is the music of the people. Their voices, their lives, and their stories are in this music. And I feel it's so important to take this rich, beautiful music out and share it."

        <title>UCSC lecturer honored by French government</title>

<p>
  Miriam Ellis, a UCSC lecturer in French, has nearly 30 years of history in evidence in her campus office. Her walls are adorned with the fliers and posters, mostly in French, that represent hundreds of student performances in dozens of plays that she has staged. Her shelves are stacked with towers of manila folders containing conference agendas, brochures on study-abroad programs, research, translation projects, lecture notes, and more.
</p>Ellis's lifelong work in teaching French language and culture has just been recognized by the French government, which has awarded her one of its highest academic honor--the Palmes Academiques. The honor, which bestows the rank of chevalier (or knight), is given to those who have advanced the cause of French culture, education, and the arts.<br>
<br>
"The award is very often given to French citizens but rarely to foreign nationals," said Herve Le Mansec, a UCSC lecturer in French and Consul Honoraire de France for San Jose and Silicon Valley. "Miriam has devoted her life to French studies, and the award recognizes a very creative and productive career."<br>
<br>
Ellis came to UCSC in 1971 as a graduate student and is one of the few people who has been affiliated with campus as a student, staff member, and faculty member.<br>
<br>
While earning her Ph.D. in literature here in 1979, Ellis worked as a student adviser. As a faculty member, she is known for her innovative ways of teaching French. One of her favorite approaches is through drama. "I've been doing theater for about a million years," she jokes. "It is the best pedagogical tool for language learning that I've seen. Along with teaching the language, a theater experience gives students a sense of teamwork, responsibility, creativity, organization, and self-confidence."<br>
<br>
Although her career really doesn't reach back to the Jurassic era, Ellis has staged an impressive number of theater and musical productions since she began teaching. Most recently, she was the stage director for <i>The Sisters of the Visitation</i> (a full-length opera she translated and adapted with UCSC music professor Sherwood Dudley). For last year's Cowell College Culture Break, she directed <i>Paris between the Wars,</i> a cabaret piece, and a staged reading in French of <i>Docteur Knock.</i><br>
<br>
Ellis was also instrumental in securing and implementing nearly $300,000 in funds from the National Endowment for the Humanities between 1993 and 1997. The funds made it possible for UCSC faculty to offer classes combining language learning with other topics, e.g., Chinese drama, French sociology, and Italian linguistics.<br>
<br>
"I'm quite honored to receive this recognition," Ellis said. But she quickly changed the subject back to her theater work, diving into one of her towers of files to bring out materials on a future project--a collaboration with three other faculty members to produce scenes from works in French, Spanish, Greek, and Chinese. "That's what keeps you going, isn't it," she asks, an impish twinkle in her eye. "Doing something you love."<br>
<br>
Two other UCSC professors have received the Palmes Academiques. Le Mansec was awarded the medal in 1993 and professor of history Jonathan Beecher received the honor in 1998. Ellis will be presented with the medal later this year in a private ceremony.

  Murray Baumgarten, professor of English and comparative literature, recently presented a weekend of lectures at K.A.M. Isaiah Israel Congregation in Chicago as the temple's Weinstein-Levin Scholar-in-Residence. As the scholar-in-residence, Baumgarten presented three lectures: "Philip Roth, Defender of the Faith"; "Storytelling and Redemption: Isaac Bashevis Singer's <i>Gimpel the Fool</i> and Rebecca Goldstein's <i>Mazel";</i> and "Primo Levi: Science, Hope, and Auschwitz." Baumgarten is coholder of the Neufeld-Levin Endowed Holocaust Chair.

        <title>UC, UPTE-CWA reach agreement on wages for technical employees</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  UC Office of the President The University of California and the University Professional and Technical Employees-Communications Workers of America (UPTE-CWA) reached tentative agreement in early November on wages and other reopened contract articles for 4,000 technical employees at UC. For technical unit employees on UC campuses, the tentative agreement includes a 2 percent retroactive range increase for 1998-99 and 1999-2000. Most technical unit employees will receive a 2 percent across-the-board retroactive salary increase each year. Employees in certain technical unit classifications will also receive a lump-sum signing bonus. For technical unit employees at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, the merit system will be continued, with a 4 percent merit pool for 1998-99 and a 3.5 percent merit pool for 1999-2000. The agreement includes other compensation adjustments for certain classifications and some minor changes to other contract articles. Employees in the technical unit include laboratory assistants, computer resource specialists and animal technicians, among others. The initial contract for the technical unit took effect in 1997, and the tentative agreement will extend it until September 2000. Negotiations between the university and the union have centered on reopened articles of the contract. Technical unit employees and university representatives must ratify the tentative agreement before it can be implemented. That process is expected to be completed by the end of November. Prospective pay increases will be distributed within 60 days of the first pay period following ratification, and retroactive increases will be paid within 120 days of the first pay period following ratification.

<h4>
  <font color="#003399">Meningitis vaccine</font>
</h4>

<p>
  Over the past decade there has been a rising incidence of outbreaks of meningitis reported on college campuses. This has prompted the American College Health Association (ACHA) to recommend that college students "consider vaccination to reduce their risk for potentially fatal meningococcal disease." There is a vaccine available against meningococcal disease that is 85 percent effective against many, but not all, of the subgroups of meningococcal bacteria. The Student Health Service is following the ACHA recommendation of making vaccination and information available to students. Students can make an appointment for vaccination by calling (831) 459-2500. Immunization costs $65, plus the injection fee. Most health insurance, including the campus undergraduate and graduate plans, does not cover the cost of this preventive measure, but charges can be billed to the student's university account. For more information on meningococcal disease, go to the <a href="http://www.acha.org/special-prj/men.htm">American College Health Association Web site.</a>

<h4>
  <font color="#003399">Nominations for Regents' Professors and Lecturers sought</font>
</h4>

<p>
  The Committee on Regents' Professors and Lecturers is soliciting nominations for the 2000-01 academic year. The program was established to bring distinguished men and women from nonacademic careers to the university. The program has limited funding for stipends and travel only. Sponsoring units should be prepared to cover other expenses such as housing, transportation, etc., during the individual's visit to campus. Regents' Lecturer appointments may be for two weeks or more, but less than a full quarter; Regents' Professors may serve for a quarter and the individual may be assigned a course to teach. Full information on the program is in the <a href="http://www.ucop.edu/acadadv/acadpers/apm/s2-290.html">Academic Personnel Manual.</a> Nominations should originate from academic units rather than individuals and should provide detailed information on how the nominee would be utilized. The deadline for submission of nominations to the committee is November 30. Requests for additional information should be directed to Linda Mueller, Academic Human Resources, at (831) 459-4689, or mule@cats.<font color="#000000">ucsc.edu.</font>

<p>
  When outreach counselor Ramona Ornelas invited Danny Yetter to attend a UCSC program for San Benito High School students last August, she didn't know she'd be changing the young man's life.
</p>But that's what happened.<br>
<br>
"I picked kids I thought would never have this opportunity," explained Ornelas, who works with UCSC's Early Academic Outreach Program (EAOP). "But they were kids for whom I thought the opportunity could really change their outlook."<br>
<br>
In Yetter's case, the experience transformed a defiant 15-year-old who had no interest in school into a hardworking college-bound high school sophomore.<br>
<br>
"I think initially he went as much to hang out with his friends as for school, but it completely turned him around," said Ornelas, whose comments were echoed by Yetter's mother, Linda.<br>
<br>
"Danny came home with a completely different attitude toward school," she said. "We weren't expecting that. We just wanted him to be part of the experience, but he rose to the occasion and did the work. The little taste of college life really motivated him."<br>
<br>
The four-day program that made such a difference for Danny is one of many residential programs offered by EAOP with the goal of exposing teenagers to college life. The emphasis is on creating a realistic college atmosphere, so the students, who attend the program at no cost, stayed in residence halls, were taught astronomy, sociology, and literature by UCSC graduate students, and participated in workshops on applying to college and receiving financial aid. They even had to wait in line at the bookstore to "buy" their own textbooks.<br>
<br>
"The classes were so hard it makes high school homework seem a lot easier," said Danny. "I thought UC classes would be hard, and the fact that I did it, I guess I got the feeling I could make it in college."<br>
<br>
Danny, who finished his freshman year with below a 2.0 grade-point average despite test scores that indicated he was capable of more, is now taking college-track courses, getting an "A" in math after failing last year--and he wants to attend UCSC.<br>
<br>
The rigor is part of the idea, said Ornelas. "We tortured the kids," recalled Ornelas. "They were up at 5:30 and going until ten o'clock at night. They had breaks to eat, but that was all."<br>
<br>
The experience was so profound for the 108 participants that they decided on the bus ride home to have a reunion, which took place in early November. "They really bonded," said Ornelas. "They all got really close."<br>
<br>
Outreach counselors like Ornelas enjoy a high level of job satisfaction as they witness the impact their work has on young lives, and many draw on unlikely resources as they seek to open doors for students, said EAOP Director Edward Aguilar, whose corps of outreach counselors work four out of five days in the field.<br>
<br>
"I don't want to see them in the office unless it's Friday," Aguilar said with a smile. "They're out working in the schools. These high schools may be only a half-hour drive away, but they're a million miles away psychologically. The students need them."<br>
<br>
Anabel Arreola, EAOP regional coordinator and a 1990 graduate of San Benito High School, had only been on the job for a few months when she received a call from high school student Griselda Ruiz, who needed help convincing her father to let her attend the summer institute.<br>
<br>
"She is the oldest daughter, and he didn't want her to stay in the dorms," recalled Arreola. "He was prepared to take time off work and bring the whole family to stay in a hotel with her in Santa Cruz. That's how traditional he was."<br>
<br>
Although Ruiz's father supported his daughter's college ambitions, Griselda was caught in a cultural bind. Fortunately, Arreola was up to the task.<br>
<br>
"I had to share a little of my personal experience to make him more comfortable," she explained. "When I went to college, my dad didn't realize the dorms at San Jose State were coed, and when he saw that, he wanted to put me in the car and take me home. So I knew where he was coming from."<br>
<br>
Arreola was able to describe the program, the level of supervision the students would receive, and the housing arrangements (boys and girls are housed on separate floors), which helped reassure Griselda's father. And she managed to convey to him the importance of the residential component of the program. "That's the whole purpose, really," she said. "I told him that if she didn't stay on campus, she wouldn't get the full experience of college life."<br>
<br>
The next day, Griselda received permission to attend.<br>
<br>
"It was probably the best thing I've ever done as far as motivating me to go to college," said Griselda, a good student who has dreamed of going to college since junior high. "It showed me that once you go to college and put your mind to something, you can learn as much as you want about anything you want. That's different from high school. I could really see myself in college."<br>
<br>
As good as it was for her, Griselda also saw the value of four days away from home--her first time ever--for her parents. "I'm going to go to college sooner or later, and I thought it would be good for my parents," she said. "It helped them a lot, too. When I came back, they were totally supportive. They trust me a lot more. I guess before they didn't think I was serious or something."<br>
<br>
During the summer program, Griselda's family surprised her with a visit. Filled with the excitement of her time away from home, Griselda was initially embarrassed and tried to avoid her relatives until Arreola described having felt the same emotions about her own family. She was able to make Griselda laugh at her stories, but she also reminded the young woman how important it was to be a good role model for her younger siblings. Griselda overcame her discomfort and visited with her relatives.<br>
<br>
"It worked out for the whole family," said Arreola, who admits that she kept an extra close eye on Griselda during the four days to ensure that all went well. "Most of these students had never been away from home before."<br>
<br>
For UCSC, the benefits of EAOP programs continue to unfold as the students return to their high schools and serve as "ambassadors" for the university, sharing their experiences and enthusiasm about college with their classmates. Danny Yetter has already convinced several friends to attend the program next summer, and all of his friends from last summer are thinking about going to college.<br>
<br>
"We tell them to take the torch and that they must pass it to their classmates," said Aguilar. "It might sound like a cliche to say this program changes lives, but it's true. Often, not only is a student changed, but a whole family is changed."

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  <i>Silicon Valley,</i> the Sunday magazine of the <i>San Jose Mercury News,</i> profiled <b>Chancellor Greenwood</b> for a recent cover story. Starting out with her adventures playing laser tag and riding bumper cars with students during UCSC's back-to-school night at the Boardwalk, the feature went on to discuss weightier issues, such as UCSC's growth in the field of engineering, its expansion into Silicon Valley, and its academic plan for the next century. Also quoted for the story were <b>Eli Hollander</b> of film and digital media, community studies' <b>Michael Rotkin</b> and <b>Mary Beth Pudup,</b> engineering dean <b>Patrick Mantey,</b> and <b>Bettina Aptheker</b> of women's studies.<br>
  <br>
  In her first week of teaching here, film and digital media's <b>Amelie Hastie</b> was interviewed on the subject of popular culture. The <a href="http://www.nationalpost.com/network.asp?f=991004/93477.html">story</a> appeared in Toronto's <i>National Post</i> and discussed new television programming that is much less youth-obsessed on the surface (featuring baby boomer-aged actors) but still deals with very teen-oriented subjects. <b><br></b>
</p>

<p>
  For a feature on the legendary Chicano poet and activist Alurista, San Jose's <i>Metro</i> turned to literature professor <b>Kirsten Silva Gruesz</b> for perspective. Gruesz was quoted extensively in the story, speaking on the stature of Alurista and the dynamics of the development of Chicano culture in California.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Dana Frank</b> of American studies has been quoted several times during the recent debate in Santa Cruz City Council chambers over allowing a Borders bookstore to open up shop downtown. Frank's comments appeared in both the <i>Santa Cruz County Sentinel</i> and the <i>San Jose Mercury News.<br>
  <br></i>The dedication of the new University Town Center in downtown Santa Cruz drew the interest of local media. The story was covered by the <i>San Jose Mercury News,</i> the <i>Santa Cruz County Sentinel,</i> KSBW-Channel 8, and the <i>Connection.</i> Quoted in stories were <b>Gesna Clarke</b> of Housing, Dining, and Child Care Services, <b>Terry Spice</b> of UCSC Extension, and <b>Chancellor Greenwood</b>, who was quoted as saying, "This building is a concrete example--literally--of the revitalization of downtown Santa Cruz, which we very much want to be a part of."<br>
  <br>
  The latest work of composer <b>Hi Kyung Kim</b> was the focus of a story that appeared in L.A.'s <i>Korea Times.<br></i>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  UC Office of the President The California Digital Library has received $1.5 million from three federal programs to support the ongoing construction of a major digital collection of photographs, manuscripts, organizational records, and other significant materials from organizations in California that contribute to the rich history of the Golden State. Through a collection called the Online Archive of California, patrons of the <a href="http://www.cdlib.org">Digital Library</a> can access a fascinating array of materials that include photographs of the aftermath of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, diary pages from a member of the ill-fated Donner party, and sketches and artwork created by early California residents. The materials, comprising well over 100 separate archival collections with digitized materials, also include scenes of early agriculture in the San Joaquin Valley, views of the borax industry, photos of early travel in California's national parks, gold rush mining towns, and the state's oil industry, as well as objects held by UCLA's Fowler Museum and UC Berkeley's Berkeley Art Museum. Patrons can also consult online the inventories, or "finding aids," of more than 3,000 collections of archival materials housed in more than 40 separate libraries, museums, historical societies and other California organizations. These inventories document and describe materials as rich and varied as California's multi-faceted past. Collection themes range from the television and film industries to the Free Speech Movement at UC Berkeley; from papers associated with individuals involved in politics, literature, and architecture to a county sheriff's wanted notices at the turn of the century; from organizations such as the Sierra Club to the California Federation of Teachers to the Gay and Lesbian Historical Society of Northern California. Digital access to the finding aids and to the primary source materials has been highly praised by the scholarly community and has been incorporated experimentally into the curriculum of primary and secondary schools in California through special collaboration with UC Berkeley's California Heritage and Interactive University projects. The new financial support supplements an ongoing commitment by the University of California to enhance the Online Archive of California (OAC) both by extending the number of organizations and their finding aids, and by digitizing and making available much more of the primary source materials -- the photographs, manuscript pages, artworks and papers -- within those collections. A $400,000 grant from the Library Services and Technology Act to the California Digital Library (CDL), administered by the California State Library, will enable the creation of the Japanese American Relocation Digital Archive. Plans include digitizing text, visual material, and audio content drawn from oral histories, plus designing OAC finding aids to navigate the material. This will be a cooperative project involving nine OAC participants: UC Berkeley, UCLA, the Japanese American National Museum, California State Universities at Fullerton and Sonoma, the University of the Pacific, the University of Southern California, the California Historical Society, and the California State Archive. Because the Japanese-American population at the outbreak of World War II was largely in California, the holdings of California libraries on relocation issues are especially strong, including, for example, the official Japanese American Evacuation and Resettlement Records at UC Berkeley, the records of the Manzanar War Relocation Center at UCLA, and numerous collections of personal papers of prominent Japanese Americans who lived through the relocation. With a $500,000 National Leadership grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services, the CDL, the Berkeley Art Museum, and the Pacific Film Archive at UC Berkeley will lead a group of eight museums in evaluating the capabilities of the digital finding aid technology, known as Encoded Archival Description, to integrate their collection descriptions into the OAC virtual archive collections. An additional $600,000 from the Library of Congress (LC) will support cooperation between OAC and LC's National Digital Library Program. Funds will be used for digitizing materials related to several important historical themes with a strong connection to California. These include a focus on the Japanese-American relocation materials, as well as the Russian presence in early Northern California; California Missions and their role in the settlement of the state; and the especially strong holdings of OAC member libraries related to the westward migration, collections that powerfully complement and expand existing Library of Congress digital collections in its American Memory program. The convergence of shared goals, standards, technical capabilities and program commitments presents a unique opportunity for the Library of Congress and the University of California to leverage, mutually reinforce, and enrich their digital collections of unique primary source material. "The combination of these three independent sources of support and collaboration for the Online Archive of California is a vote of confidence for the importance of the materials as well as for continued leadership from California in building digital collections," said Richard Lucier, university librarian and executive director of the CDL. "We're proud of and thankful for the collaboration represented by the OAC. Collaboration is inherent in its success and funding, has been essential for development of the supporting technologies, and is the only way to build these important digital collections for scholarly and public use." Enhancement of the Online Archive of California and digitization of additional primary source materials will make them readily available to thousands of scholars, community leaders, writers and artists, students, and citizens who are unaware of these unique collections or unable to travel to dozens of California archives to use them. Complementing the physical libraries on the nine campuses of the University of California system, the California Digital Library focuses on selecting, building, managing, preserving, and providing access to shared collections of high-quality digital materials for UC and its partners. Browsing and searching tools at the CDL provide enhanced access to the Melvyl(r) Union Catalog of book materials held by UC campuses and a number of partners, a union list of periodicals located in more than 500 libraries in California, electronic journals from major scholarly publishers, journal abstracting and indexing databases, and the archival finding aids of the OAC. Many of these resources, notably Melvyl, the California Periodicals database, and the OAC, are available to the public.

<p>
  Ronnie Gilbert, a leading voice in music and activist circles for a half century, will present a public lecture at UCSC on Thursday, November 18.
</p>A founding member of the Weavers (a legendary folk ensemble that also featured Pete Seeger, Lee Hays, and Fred Hellerman), Gilbert is in town as a UC Regents' Lecturer. Her talk is entitled "The Making of Mother Jones" and takes place at 7:30 p.m. on Thursday, November 18, in the Second Stage Theater. A reception follows. The event is free and open to the public.<br>
<br>
As a Regents' Lecturer, Gilbert has presented a number of workshops, performances, and lectures this month on activism, performing arts, and social movements. The November 18 presentation is based on her collaborative work, "The Most Dangerous Woman in America: A Musical Tribute to Mother Jones," a stirring theater piece about the great labor leader Mother Jones. The play was also turned into the book, <i>Face to Face with the Most Dangerous Woman in America</i> (Conari Press).<br>
<br>
A playwright, singer, and actress, Gilbert has performed and created works that have appeared in a range of venues, from small experimental theaters to Broadway stages. She was the voice of Elizabeth Cady Stanton in Ken Burns's documentary, <i>Not For Ourselves Alone,</i> and has served as the narrator for and appeared in several film documentaries, most notably, <i>The Weavers: Wasn't That a Time!</i><br>
<br>
The performance is presented by the Women's Studies Department. For more information, call (831) 459-4324.

<p>
  Just in time for holiday feasting and gift giving, the Friends of the UCSC Farm & Garden are pleased to announce publication of their second cookbook, <i>Seasonal Recipes from the Great Chefs of Santa Cruz County.</i>
</p>Featuring 81 recipes from chefs cooking for the area's premiere restaurants and catering companies, the cookbook highlights the use of seasonally fresh produce in everything from appetizers to main dishes and desserts.
<p>
  As Deborah Madison, founding chef of Greens Restaurant in San Francisco and author of <i>The Savory Way,</i> writes in the introduction to the new cookbook, "starting with good-tasting, startlingly fresh vegetables means that more than half the battle with cooking is won. In fact, cooking ceases to be a battle and becomes the pleasure it should be."<br>
  <br>
  The recipes are presented in four separate seasonal sections, each of which is introduced with a description by UCSC garden manager Orin Martin of the garden during fall, winter, spring, and summer. The cookbook, which is spiral bound and lies flat for easy use, also features original drawings by local artist Graydon Livingston.<br>
  <br>
  The cookbook will be available in local bookstores, Integrand Design, and other outlets in early December. The suggested retail price is $19.95. Proceeds from sales support the work of the Friends of the UCSC Farm & Garden, including community education in organic farming and gardening.<br>
  <br>
  Two events are being held to celebrate the arrival of the new cookbook, which follows publication three years ago of <i>Recipes from the Great Chefs of Santa Cruz County.</i><br>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  The winter campus closure begins Friday, December 24, and continues through Sunday, January 2. In all, the campus will be closed for ten days; four days are scheduled holidays (December 24, 27, 30, and 31), four days are weekend days, and the remaining two days (December 28, 29) are designated workdays. To cover the two designated workdays, full-time staff employees will be required to use 16 hours of vacation, compensatory time off, or leave without pay. Employees without sufficient accumulated vacation will be allowed to use up to two days of vacation leave prior to actual accrual.
</p>

<p>
  New employees who are normally required to wait six months before using accrued vacation will be allowed to use their vacation even if the required waiting period has not been completed.
</p>

<p>
  Part-time employees who are eligible for vacation may borrow vacation hours on a prorated basis in accordance with their percentage of appointment.
</p>

<p>
  Employees scheduled to work on December 28 and 29 will be compensated at their regular rate of pay.<br>
  <br>
  Due to the diverse responsibilities of academic appointees and the flexibility in performing their obligations, it is anticipated that some academic appointees will continue working during the campus closure.
</p>

<p>
  Fiscal-year (11-month) appointees will be expected to use vacation for this period, if the closure precludes their working.<br>
  <br>
  Campus Service Centers may refer to the Staff Human Resources (SHR) Procedures Manual, Campus Closure: Questions and Answers, beginning on page F13-25 for additional information.

        <title>UCSC New Teacher Center brokers unprecedented agreement</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 08 Nov 1999 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>9040</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  The UCSC New Teacher Center's role as a major player in state educational issues was underscored recently when the center brokered an unprecedented agreement between key teacher unions and school management groups. Following extended negotiations that took place during the summer at the behest of the center, four organizations were able to draft a statement of cooperation and support regarding the implementation of controversial legislation designed to improve the teaching profession. The agreement represents "a very promising signal," Education Secretary Gary Hart said during a Sacramento press conference announcing the agreement. "The most important players in the California public education system are joining forces in the best interest of our children's future." The legislation, dubbed the California Peer Assistance and Review Program for Teachers, or PAR, was designed to improve the classroom performance of teachers by establishing programs to assist veteran teachers who are experiencing difficulties. Under the new law, these teachers are assisted and their performance is reviewed by a select group of high-performing teachers. The bill's author, Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa, said the joint agreement "ensures teachers and schools are given the appropriate types of assistance developed locally for them to succeed--with the larger goal of improving the education of our children." New Teacher Center Director Ellen Moir applauded the willingness of the four organizations--the California Teachers Association, the California Federation of Teachers, the Association of California School Administrators, and the California School Boards Association--to reach agreement. "To their enormous credit, these four organizations felt that they must put aside their differences, in relation to this issue, to formulate a coordinated response to this legislation," she said. "They realize the stakes--Peer Assistance and Review represents an exciting opportunity for the teaching profession. However, PAR requires teachers, administrators, districts, and unions to work together in new ways." The joint statement, she said, encourages local school districts and unions to "stretch" in order to make PAR work for students and teachers. "The New Teacher Center is proud to have facilitated this important agreement," she added. Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood heralded the announcement. "By facilitating this agreement, the UC Santa Cruz New Teacher Center has demonstrated its leadership role in education," said Greenwood. "As the state of California addresses one of our most pressing social problems, the University of California, Santa Cruz, is proud to share its resources and expertise." Statewide implementation of PAR represents a major challenge, given its impact on the way schools operate and funding incentives that reward early development of PAR programs. Teachers are asked to take on significant new levels of responsibility to ensure teacher quality, and district administrators are asked to share what has been their traditional turf. Therefore, key management and labor groups felt compelled to address issues that could present obstacles at the local district level and at the bargaining table. The legislation allows teachers to be observed over time, and Moir expressed optimism that the law "can be used by all teachers to strengthen the teaching profession." "Our meetings concerning this legislation produced some of the most exciting, groundbreaking conversations I've heard about the profession," said Moir. "Clearly, the representatives from all four groups felt there was a window here to make real changes in the teaching profession and in the ways teachers and administrators work with one another."

Each group consists of five to seven members who make a commitment to meet four hours each month for one year. At these meetings, participants learn from one another through open, frank discussion about assumptions, stereotypes, and individual perceptions of difference. The program requires that supervisors release their employees two hours each month to attend group meetings and that employees volunteer two hours of their own time. Groups will be forming by mid-November. For more information or to join a group, contact Terilynn Pennisi-Miller at (831) 459-3252 or terilynn@cats.ucsc.edu.</font>

<h4>
  <font color="#003399">Meningitis vaccine</font>
</h4>

<p>
  Over the past decade there has been a rising incidence of outbreaks of meningitis reported on college campuses. This has prompted the American College Health Association (ACHA) to recommend that college students "consider vaccination to reduce their risk for potentially fatal meningococcal disease." There is a vaccine available against meningococcal disease that is 85 percent effective against many, but not all, of the subgroups of meningococcal bacteria. The Student Health Service is following the ACHA recommendation of making vaccination and information available to students. Students can make an appointment for vaccination by calling (831) 459-2500. Immunization costs $65, plus the injection fee. Most health insurance, including the campus undergraduate and graduate plans, does not cover the cost of this preventive measure, but charges can be billed to the student's university account. For more information on meningococcal disease, go to the <a href="http://www.acha.org/special-prj/men.htm">American College Health Association Web site.</a>

<h4>
  <font color="#003399">Nominations for Regents' Professors and Lecturers sought</font>
</h4>

<p>
  The Committee on Regents' Professors and Lecturers is soliciting nominations for the 2000-01 academic year. The program was established to bring distinguished men and women from nonacademic careers to the university. The program has limited funding for stipends and travel only. Sponsoring units should be prepared to cover other expenses such as housing, transportation, etc., during the individual's visit to campus. Regents' Lecturer appointments may be for two weeks or more, but less than a full quarter; Regents' Professors may serve for a quarter and the individual may be assigned a course to teach. Full information on the program is in the <a href="http://www.ucop.edu/acadadv/acadpers/apm/s2-290.html">Academic Personnel Manual.</a> Nominations should originate from academic units rather than individuals and should provide detailed information on how the nominee would be utilized. The deadline for submission of nominations to the committee is November 30. Requests for additional information should be directed to Linda Mueller, Academic Human Resources, at (831) 459-4689, or mule@cats.<font color="#000000">ucsc.edu.</font>

  <b>Stan Woosley,</b> professor and chair of astronomy and astrophysics, and his<br>
  graduate student <b>Andrew MacFadyen</b> were featured in a <i>U.S. News and World<br>
  Report</i> story about gamma ray bursts. The article discussed new observations<br>
  that support Woosley and MacFadyen's theories regarding the origins of<br>
  gamma ray bursts. Their research is also the subject of an article on NASA's new <a href="http://science.nasa.gov/newhome/headlines/ast02nov99_1.htm">Space Science News Web site</a>.<br>
  <br>
  In a talk at the Missouri Botanical Garden last month, professor of biology <b>Lynda Goff</b> caught the attention of a reporter for the <i>St. Louis Post-Dispatch.</i> Goff described her research on parasitism in red algae as "Borg biology" (a reference to an alien race in the television series <i>Star Trek: The Next Generation)</i> because of the way the parasites take over and transform the cells of their hosts.<br>
  <br>
  <i>New Scientist</i> magazine's cover story on October 16 focused on efforts by UCSC researchers, led by professor of chemistry and biochemistry <b>David Deamer</b>, and another group at Harvard University to develop nanopore technology for superfast DNA sequencing.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Ellen Moir</b> of the New Teacher Center was on Pasadena radio station KPCC with California Education Secretary Gary Hart last week. . . . Also on southern California's airwaves was <b>Mike Urban</b> of politics, who was heard on Pacifica Radio's KPFK Radio in Los Angeles discussing Russia, the Chechen war, and Russian elections.
</p>

<p>
  Rounding out the southern California media wave was <b>Manuel Pastor</b> of Latin American and Latino studies, who coauthored an opinion piece for the <i>Los Angeles Times</i> about environmental justice. . . . More locally, <b>Pastor</b> participated in a Watsonville "visioning" forum on that community's future.

  Nomy Lamm, a leading activist in the fat liberation movement, will deliver a lecture at UCSC on Wednesday, November 10, at 7 p.m. Her talk, "It's a Big, Fat Revolution!" will take place in Classroom Unit 2 and is free and open to the public. Lamm is a self-described "fat freaky disabled anarchist jew dyke," as well as a freelance writer, lecturer, and performance artist. She lives in Olympia, Washington, and is a graduate of Evergreen State College. Named one of <i>Ms.</i> magazine's "Women of the Year" in 1997 for her work fighting fat oppression, Lamm recently released her first full-length CD of music and spoken word on Olympia's Talent Show Recordings. Her writings have appeared in numerous anthologies, including <i>Adios, Barbie: Young Women Write About Body Image and Identity</i> and <i>Listen Up: Voices from the Next Feminist Generation.</i> Her articles have appeared in magazines such as <i>Ms., Seventeen,</i> and <i>HUES.</i> Lamm spent the past summer touring with Sister Spit, the San Francisco-based all-girl spoken-word road show. She is currently writing a full-length rock opera that will premiere next July. Lamm's visit is being cosponsored by the UCSC Women's Center and the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Resource Center. For more information, contact the UCSC Women's Center at (831) 459-2291.

        <title>Gibson receives $500,000 federal grant to continue research at Aptos High</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  Margaret Gibson, a professor of education and anthropology, has received a federal grant of nearly $500,000 to expand a research project at Aptos High School that is exploring the role of peer influence in achievement among students of Mexican descent. Gibson's latest infusion of support comes from the U.S. Department of Education/Office of Educational Research and Improvement. The three-year grant for $495,489 will enable her to follow her research subjects at Aptos High through their graduation in 2002. It will also allow Gibson and her team of researchers to expand their scope and conduct some comparative work at several other high schools beginning next year. Gibson's study, which began last year, is looking closely at students' informal relationships with each other, as well as with teachers and other school personnel, to learn how peers affect students' identities and orientations toward schooling. The Spencer Foundation provided a grant for $459,500 to support the initial project, which was a two-year study based at Aptos High, where nearly half of the freshman class is of Mexican descent. The National Science Foundation also provided a grant of about $50,000 for the first year. The project has implications for schools that are trying to find more effective ways to meet the needs of all students, said Gibson, who is eager to identify positive interventions that cut through the ambivalence, resistance, or sense of alienation that can prevent students from being engaged. Aptos High is recognized for its strong academic programs, yet student performance reflects disturbing national and state patterns of disproportionately low academic achievement among students of Mexican descent. In 1996, only 20 percent of Aptos High seniors of Mexican descent who graduated had completed advanced math and science classes, compared to 74 percent of white seniors.

        <title>Campus community urged to prepare for emergencies</title>

<p>
  When the Loma Prieta earthquake toppled buildings and knocked out power throughout Santa Cruz county ten years ago, it served as a wake-up call to the campus that earthquakes and other emergencies <i>do</i> happen. In response to the quake, the campus updated its campus Emergency Response Plan, which details policies, procedures, and an organizational hierarchy for response to a major emergency. UCSC also improved its Emergency Operations Center at the campus fire station, adding telephone lines, a radio system, and a new generator, said UCSC Fire Chief Chuck Hernandez. Campus units created building-specific disaster plans, and executive staff, building coordinators, and other members of the campus community began participating in emergency training sessions. But faculty and staff should also prepare for emergencies on an individual basis, Hernandez said. Members of the campus community are encouraged to:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Be informed about the campus's Emergency Disaster Plan, available on the Web at <a href="http://ehs.ucsc.edu/emplan/">ehs.ucsc.edu/emplan.</a>
  </li>
  <li>Identify your building coordinator, who will act as liaison between unit coordinators and the Emergency Operations Center in the event of an emergency.
  </li>
  <li>Know your unit's or building's emergency plan and established evacuation areas.
  </li>
  <li>Take important belongings with you (keys, wallet, purse) in case of evacuation. It may be some time before you can re-enter your space to retrieve them.
  </li>
  <li>Learn CPR and basic first aid.
  </li>
  <li>Develop a plan in advance for contacting family members or having others care for them.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Each unit or department should also keep a battery-powered radio, flashlight, and first-aid kit in an easily accessible place, Hernandez said. He also recommends that people tune to KZSC 88.1 FM, call (831) 459-INFO, or log onto <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu">www.ucsc.edu</a> for information during an emergency.<br>
  <br>
  "Primarily, folks need to realize that in a major emergency, in the first 72 hours all police, fire, and medical services will be completely overwhelmed," said Hernandez. "People will need to depend on their own skills to help themselves and others out of emergencies."<br>
  <br>
  For more information, call the UCSC Fire Department at (831) 459-3473 or Environmental Health and Safety at (831) 459-2553.<br>
  <br>

<p>
  <b><br></b>
</p>Susan Willats knows firsthand how important training in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can be.<br>
<br>
Willats was working at Natural Sciences 2 in July when a fellow Business and Administrative Services staff member ran into her office and asked if she knew CPR. A Summer Session student, who wishes to remain anonymous, had collapsed in a nearby hallway. The young woman's classmates were standing nearby, not knowing what to do.<br>
<br>
"It was such an unreal situation," Willats recalled. "I'd taken several CPR classes and had never been called upon to use any of that information. I was amazingly calm, maybe because the situation felt so unreal."<br>
<br>
The student's heart was beating, but she had stopped breathing. When Willats opened the victim's airway and began mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, the woman's lungs responded, "like they suddenly remembered what they should be doing," Willats said.<br>
<br>
When the young woman stopped breathing for a second time, Willats resuscitated her again.<br>
<br>
It wasn't until paramedics took the student away on a gurney that Willats felt the impact of what had happened. "That's when I got shaky," she said.<br>
<br>
Willats--whose office was moved into Natural Sciences 2 just the week before--was thankful she'd had CPR training. "You're not given the opportunity very often to make such an incredible difference in someone's life," she said.<br>
<br>
Willats had taken a CPR class through the UCSC Fire Department in 1987 and a refresher course in 1989. Four years ago, she had also participated in a pediatric CPR course at Dominican Hospital.<br>
<br>
She encourages others to take CPR. "You never know what you're going to find around the next corner."<br>
<br>
CPR classes are available locally from the American Red Cross at (831) 462-2881 and at Dominican Hospital at (831) 462-7709. The American Red Cross also offers courses in first aid.<br>
<br>
A limited number of classes are also offered by the UCSC Fire Department. Call (831) 459-3473 for more information or go to <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/fire_dept/">www2.ucsc.edu/fire_dept/</a>.

Michael Cowan, a professor of American studies and literature, has been named to the position of vice chair of the Academic Council. The council is the steering committee of the universitywide Academic Senate, which serves all nine of UC's academic campuses.<br>
<br>
Cowan will hold the position for a year before stepping into the position of chair of the Academic Council--the most important office in the statewide Academic Senate. Cowan's appointment was effective September 1.<br>
<br>
Cowan has a long record of administrative service and commitment to academic excellence. Since he joined UCSC in 1969, he has served as dean of humanities and arts (from 1983 to 1989); founding chair of the American Studies Department in 1978 and chair again in 1990-99; and chair of the Academic Senate of UCSC in 1978-79 and 1994-96 (making him the only person to serve twice on the UCSC senate). In 1978-79 he was provost of Merrill College.<br>
<br>
In 1997, Cowan received the UCSC Academic Senate's inaugural Dean E. McHenry prize--an award given every other year to acknowledge outstanding service. He is past president (1984-86) and an active member of the National American Studies Association.

        <title>Shakespeare Santa Cruz brings favorite fairy tale to the stage</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_9026" align="alignright" width="247"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/1999/11/cinderella.99-11-08.247.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-9026" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/1999/11/cinderella.99-11-08.247.jpg" alt="Image: Mott Jordan" width="247" height="246" /></a>Image: Mott Jordan[/caption]
For the third year in a row, Shakespeare Santa Cruz invites audiences to launch the holiday season with a festive family-oriented theater experience. This year the critically acclaimed theater company presents an original adaptation of the fairy tale classic, <i>Cinderella.</i>
<p>
  This original version is written by local playwright and Shakespeare Santa Cruz (SSC) veteran actress Kate Hawley.
</p>
<p>
  Hawley has written Cinderella in the British pantomime tradition. Anything but silent, British pantomimes are a form of popular musical traditionally staged at Christmastime in England. The productions are based on traditional fairy tales and feature songs, comedy, and stock characters.
</p>
<p>
  At the heart of "pantos" is a comic character known as "the Dame" (in this case, Cinderella's stepmother, Mrs. Baden-Rotten). Irascible, irrepressible, vulgar, and vain, the Dame is always played by a male comedian. Pantos also feature a good fairy (in this case, Cinderella's godmother) and often a "skin part"--an actor dressed as an animal (for this production a dancing bear will fill the role). And, of course, no pantos is complete without a principal boy and a principal girl.<br>
  Several other stock characters will be featured in SSC's <i>Cinderella:</i> Buttons, Cinderella's loyal friend (who enjoys chatting with the audience); Baron Hardup, Cinderella's irresponsible father; Dandini, the Prince's confidant; and the cruel stepsisters.
</p>
<p>
  As in all SSC productions, <i>Cinderella's</i> cast features a mix of professional, local, and UCSC student actors. An original score has been composed for <i>Cinderella.</i> The score is written by longtime SSC composer Gregg Coffin (who also wrote the score for <i>Wind in the Willows</i> and for several SSC summer productions). <i>Cinderella</i> is directed by award-winning Shakespeare Santa Cruz Artistic Director Paul Whitworth.
</p>
<p>
  <i>Cinderella</i> runs from Saturday, November 27, through Sunday, December 12. To receive a brochure contact the UCSC Ticket Office at (831) 459-2159 or visit the SSC Web page at: <a href="http://shakespearesantacruz.org/welcome.shtml">http://shakespearesantacruz.org/welcome.shtml</a>.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  The Northern California chapter of the Achievement Rewards for College Scientists (ARCS) Foundation has provided $60,000 in scholarships this year for eight UCSC students. The 1999 ARCS scholars were honored at the foundation's annual luncheon November 2 at the St. Francis Hotel in San Francisco. The ARCS Foundation is a national organization that provides scholarships and fellowships for the country's most promising science, medical, and engineering students. The foundation is the most generous provider of annual student awards to the UCSC campus. The 1999 ARCS scholars represent the departments of Earth Sciences, Biology, Astronomy and Astrophysics, Ocean Sciences/Environmental Toxicology, and Science Communication. Four UCSC graduate students received $10,000 ARCS scholarships: Mark Clementz (earth sciences), Jonna Diane Engel (biology), Anthony Gonzalez (astronomy and astrophysics), and Allison Luengen (Ocean Sciences/ETox). Four students in the Science Communication Program each received a $5,000 ARCS scholarship, plus a $5,000 personal donation from Mrs. Marion Cope. They are Margaret McKee, Jessa Forte Netting, Emily Sohn, and Catherine Zandonella. Mrs. Cope is a board member of the ARCS Foundation, a trustee of the UC Santa Cruz Foundation, and a longtime supporter of the Science Communication Program.

<p>
  Margaret Gibson, professor of education and anthropology, has been elected to the Board of Directors of the Council on Anthropology and Education, a subsection of the American Anthropological Association (AAA), for a three-year term as member at large, beginning this month.<br>
  <br>
  Gibson joins UCSC faculty members Donald Brenneis, the new president of the AAA, and Patricia Zavella, a new member of the organization's Executive Board. The AAA is the world's largest organization of individuals interested in anthropology. Its membership exceeds 10,000, and annual meetings draw more than 5,000 people.

  <font color="#003399">Women's soccer</font>
</h4><br>
The women's soccer team, coached for the fourth year by Paul Lester, made UCSC history again this year with a best-ever 16-2 season record. They finished the season ranked third in the West Region and 15th in the nation.<br>
<br>
For the first time, the women's soccer team was selected to participate in the NCAA Division III Women's Soccer National Championship Tournament. Six teams from the West Region were among those named to the 45-team tournament. The Slugs lost their first game on Saturday, November 6, in San Diego against the University of Puget Sound and are out of the tournament.

        <title>Y2K checkup: Make sure campus has power before returning for winter quarter</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 01 Nov 1999 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>9021</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  A recent TV advertisement pokes fun at a prediction that has made it to the top of most Y2K doomsday lists. The Toyota automobile spot opens with the traditional Times Square countdown--followed by a rapid succession of neighborhood blackouts as power grids throughout New York City fall victim to the so-called millennium bug.
</p>

<p>
  No one at UCSC is predicting that a similar power failure will sweep across the campus when the clock strikes midnight and the New Year begins. But that doesn't mean that staff haven't fully considered how the campus would--or would not--operate should such an outage occur.
</p>

<p>
  Pat LeCuyer, chair of UCSC's Y2K Task Force, says the major concern on campus has to do with timing: Since the winter quarter starts on Monday, January 3, a lengthy power failure in the region has the very real potential of delaying UCSC's post-holiday reopening.
</p>

<p>
  In fact, a prolonged interruption of PG&E's delivery of electricity or natural gas to the campus--however unlikely--is considered the only Y2K-related problem that would delay the start of the winter quarter.
</p>

<p>
  "We feel like we're going to be in good shape in terms of the hardware and software that processes central computer systems like the Student Information System (SIS) and Financial Information System (FIS)," says LeCuyer, acting assistant vice chancellor for Communications & Technology Services. To be on the safe side, units like the Registrar's Office and Financial Affairs, which oversee SIS and FIS, respectively, have developed contingency plans that could be implemented should those mission-critical systems fail.
</p>

<p>
  In the Registrar's Office, for example, staff members have developed an old-fashioned back-up system that would enable the campus to handle the volume of enrollment-related tasks that are completed at the beginning of each quarter. In the event of a system failure, they will record information on paper.
</p>

<p>
  However, if UCSC experiences a power outage of significant duration during the first weekend of 2000, no amount of contingency planning will enable the campus to open for winter quarter on time.
</p>

<p>
  Here's one scenario: PG&E's delivery of electricity to the campus is interrupted, but its delivery of natural gas is not. If that were to happen, UCSC's main cogeneration plant could produce enough electricity to accommodate most of the academic buildings in the campus core. (Without natural gas, diesel could power the cogeneration plant for only 72 hours.)
</p>

<p>
  Since the vast majority of the campus's power-sensitive research activities are located in academic buildings, the diversion of the plant's electricity to those areas is a top safety priority.
</p>

<p>
  But the "cogen" system alone cannot generate enough electricity to power up the campus's academic buildings <i>and</i> the administrative buildings, the eight colleges, and the pumps that distribute water.
</p>

<p>
  "While our utility companies tell us that they are ready, and we don't anticipate a Y2K power outage, we still have to plan for that eventuality," LeCuyer says.
</p>

<p>
  The Task Force, therefore, is recommending that students who live on campus "check in" on UCSC's Y2K condition <i>before</i> returning to campus after their several-week holiday break. Employees who don't live in Santa Cruz (and therefore will not know of the status of local power) are asked to do likewise.
</p>

<p>
  The Public Information Office has established a special Y2K Web site <a href="http://y2k.ucsc.edu">(y2k.ucsc.edu)</a> that will provide information on the status of power at UCSC in the hours and days that follow the countdown to Year 2000. If members of the UCSC community don't have Web access, they should phone the campus's 459-INFO emergency line for an update before returning to campus that Monday morning.

  <img align="right" alt="United Way logo" border="0" height="137" src="../art/united_way.99-11-01.gif" width="288">Encouraged by the UCSC community's record giving last year, United Way volunteers hope even more faculty and staff will support local seniors, homelesss people, children at risk, disabled people, and families in crisis. Last year, faculty and staff gave more than $80,000 during the United Way campaign, earning the campus the agency's Gold Award.<br>
  <br>
  This year's drive is getting under way this month, and volunteers in every campus unit are distributing information on how to give. Staff and faculty who wish to participate have the option of offering a one-time voluntary contribution by check or arranging a payroll deduction. Donations can be made to United Way or to any nonprofit agency in the county. Pledges are due by November 30.<br>
  <br>
  One out of every two Santa Cruz residents has received assistance from one of the 35 local nonprofits served by United Way, according to the agency. For more information, go to <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/united-way/">www2.ucsc.edu/united-way/</a> or call campaign coordinator Marlene Olson at (831) 459-5360.

  <font color="#003399">Help plan the Women at Work Retreat 2000</font>
</h4>

<p>
  <font color="#000000">The first steering committee meeting to plan the 14th Women at Work Retreat will be Wednesday, November 3, at the Cowell Health Center Conference Room from noon to 1 p.m. The retreat will be held in San Juan Bautista on May 4 and 5. This year's theme is "Coming Together in the New Millennium: Work-Life Balance." If you have any questions, contact Connie Croker at (831) 459-2713.</font>

<h4>
  <font color="#003399">Public hearing on the Supplemental EIR for Colleges Nine and Ten Residence Halls and Dining Hall November 8</font>
</h4>

<p>
  <font color="#000000">A Draft Supplemental Environmental Impact Report (SEIR) has been prepared for the Colleges Nine and Ten Residence Halls and Dining Hall project. A Public Hearing will be held on November 8 between 6 and 8 p.m. at the Barn Theater. At this meeting, campus planners will provide a description of the project and its environmental effects, and members of the public will be invited to give oral comments on the Draft SEIR for the project. Call Christine Aldecoa at (831) 459-4407 for additional information or to request accommodations for persons with disabilities.</font>
</p>

<p>
  <font color="#000000">The proposed project is the construction of six residence halls (approximately 124,200 assignable square feet) and a dining hall (approximately 31,500 asf) on the Colleges Nine and Ten site north of McLaughlin Drive in the central UCSC campus. The residence halls would provide bed spaces for approximately 807 students. The dining hall building would house dining hall facilities for the residence halls and also a University Center, with a lounge, dining hall, kitchen, and conference rooms.</font>

  <font color="#003399">Fran Crane Day in Santa Cruz</font>
</h4>

<p>
  November 5, 1999, has been proclaimed "Fran Crane Day" in the city of Santa Cruz by Mayor Katherine Beiers in honor of long-time staff member Fran Crane, a nationally recognized long-distance motorcycle rider, who died September 12 following a motorcylce accident.
</p>

<h4>
  <font color="#003399">Diversity Dialogue Groups forming</font>
</h4>

<p>
  <font color="#000000">Ten staff members have just finished the initial Diversity Dialogue Group Leader Training and are now looking to recruit staff to join their groups. Each group consists of five to seven members who make a commitment to meet four hours each month for one year. At these meetings, participants learn from one another through open, frank discussion about assumptions, stereotypes, and individual perceptions of difference. The program requires that supervisors release their employees two hours each month to attend group meetings and that employees volunteer two hours of their own time. Groups will be forming by mid-November. For more information or to join a group, contact Terilynn Pennisi-Miller at (831) 459-3252 or terilynn@cats.ucsc.edu.</font>

<h4>
  <font color="#003399">Meningitis vaccine</font>
</h4>

<p>
  Over the past decade there has been a rising incidence of outbreaks of meningitis reported on college campuses. This has prompted the American College Health Association (ACHA) to recommend that college students "consider vaccination to reduce their risk for potentially fatal meningococcal disease" There is a vaccine available against meningococcal disease that is 85 percent effective against many, but not all, of the subgroups of meningococcal bacteria. The Student Health Service is following the ACHA recommendation of making vaccination and information available to students. Students can make an appointment for vaccination by calling (831) 459-2500. Immunization costs $65, plus the injection fee. Most health insurance, including the campus undergraduate and graduate plans, does not cover the cost of this preventive measure, but charges can be billed to the student's university account. For more information on meningococcal disease, go to the <a href="http://www.acha.org/special-prj/men.htm">American College Health Association Web site.</a>

<h4>
  <font color="#003399">Nominations for Regents' Professors and Lecturers sought</font>
</h4>

<p>
  The Committee on Regents' Professors and Lecturers is soliciting nominations for the 2000-01 academic year. The program was established to bring distinguished men and women from nonacademic careers to the university. The program has limited funding for stipends and travel only. Sponsoring units should be prepared to cover other expenses such as housing, transportation, etc., during the individual's visit to campus. Regents' Lecturer appointments may be for two weeks or more, but less than a full quarter; Regents' Professors may serve for a quarter and the individual may be assigned a course to teach. Full information on the program is in the <a href="http://www.ucop.edu/acadadv/acadpers/apm/s2-290.html">Academic Personnel Manual.</a> Nominations should originate from academic units rather than individuals and should provide detailed information on how the nominee would be utilized. The deadline for submission of nominations to the committee is November 30. Requests for additional information should be directed to Linda Mueller, Academic Human Resources, at (831) 459-4689, or mule@cats.<font color="#000000">ucsc.edu.</font>

  Politics professor Gwendolyn Mink has edited a new book, <i>Whose Welfare?</i> (Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 1999), a critical response to welfare reform that presents ten essays by scholar-activists, most of whom were mobilized to campaign against the 1996 federal legislation.<br>
</p>

<p>
  The collection is divided into three sections that present historical perspectives on contemporary welfare politics; the impacts of the new welfare law on women, particularly women of color and low-wage workers; and a section devoted to visions of a just welfare state that would promote the equality of women.<br>

  Julie Glass, a math instructor at California State University, Hayward, who received her master's and doctorate degrees in mathematics from UCSC, has been named the 1999 California Professor of the Year by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. Glass, 32, has been an assistant professor at CSU Hayward since 1994. She hosts a cable television program devoted to college algebra, has authored math-oriented children's books, and is cofounder of a math and science day camp for school-age girls. She teaches two courses at CSU Hayward: introduction to proofs and math for business and social scientists. Glass has appeared on two programs on the university's local cable television station, CNTV: "Math on TV," a video course to help high school students prepare for mathematics placement exams, which ran for two years; and "College Algebra," a course offered for college credit, which also has an Internet component allowing students to interact with the instructor. The Carnegie Foundation, based in Palo Alto, established the Professor of the Year program in 1981 in cooperation with the Council for Advancement and Support of Education. Note: A detailed press release from CSU Hayward is available on the Web at <a href="http://newsline.calstate.edu/">http://newsline.calstate.edu/</a>.

        <title>Delaine Eastin visits Educational Partnership Center</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 01 Nov 1999 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>9013</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  By Chuck Perry<br>
  <br>
  The activities and accomplishments of UCSC's Educational Partnership Center are attracting the attention of some high-profile individuals. Most recently, state schools chief Delaine Eastin visited the center and remarked that the resource "stands as an example for other universities, not just in the state of California, but for the rest of the nation."
</p>

<p>
  Eastin's comments came during a tour of Santa Cruz County in October. Eastin, the state superintendent of public instruction, has visited the sites of educational partnerships that were established by local schools and the university before, but this was her first visit to the center since it moved to its off-campus location across the street from the district office of the Santa Cruz city schools.
</p>

<p>
  The EPC is the primary resource for teachers and administrators interested in forging partnerships with UCSC. Its goal is to improve higher education opportunities for all children. Eastin toured the center with Francisco Hernandez, vice chancellor for student affairs, and EPC director Carrol Moran. A special exhibition of artwork created by students of local partner schools was on display for the event. Also in attendance were State Senator Bruce McPherson, J. Michael Thompson, associate vice chancellor for outreach, admissions and student academic services, and parents and teachers of children who submitted work for the exhibition.
</p>

<p>
  The following day, former San Jose mayor Susan Hammer visited the center as a representative of Synopsis Silicon Valley Science & Technology Championship, which encourages participation in local and regional science fairs. Moran highlighted some of the university's science and math outreach initiatives, including the L.A. Basin Program's Magical School Bus tour and the California Math and Science Summer Program. Hammer was joined on her tour by Gary Robinson, president of Synopsis Silicon Valley.

        <title>University and city officials dedicate downtown building</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_9011" align="alignright" width="200"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/1999/11/utc.200.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-9011" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/1999/11/utc.200.jpg" alt="University Town Center Photo: Barbara McKenna" width="200" height="139" /></a>University Town Center Photo: Barbara McKenna[/caption]
Representatives from the city of Santa Cruz and UCSC came together on Monday, November 1, to dedicate the University Town Center. The new five-story 86,000 square-foot building is located in the heart of downtown Santa Cruz on the site of the former Ford's Department Store, which was destroyed in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake.
<p>
  The dedication ceremony featured a ribbon cutting and music by the UCSC West Javanese Gamelan ensemble. Among those making comments at the ceremony were Chancellor Greenwood; Santa Cruz City Mayor Katherine Beiers; Don Hazen, an associate planner with the City of Santa Cruz Planning Department; Michael Schmidt, CEO of the Santa Cruz Area Chamber of Commerce; and Barry Swenson, president of Barry Swenson Builder. Others attending the event included local business leaders and campus faculty and staff.
</p>
<p>
  UCSC and city officials both have reason to celebrate the completion of the new building, which will provide space for UCSC programs as well as private retailers and other businesses.
</p>
<p>
  The building was designed by Thacher & Thompson Architects of Santa Cruz and constructed by Barry Swenson Builder of San Jose and Santa Cruz. The UC Regents, on behalf of UCSC, have signed a ten-year lease on the space with the building's owner, Canfield, Laurel and Pacific L.P. (a limited partnership comprising Barry Swenson Builder and the Santa Cruz Seaside Company).
</p>
<p>
  Those from UCSC using the space will be University of California Extension, Santa Cruz (UCSC Extension) and the UTC Residential Office (a part of UCSC's Housing, Dining and Child Care Services program). The top two floors of the building provide 54 residential apartments for regularly enrolled UCSC students and students in UCSC Extension's English Language International Program. On the second floor are UCSC Extension offices, a graphics and computer lab, classrooms, and a student lounge.
</p>
<p>
  "We're delighted by the completion of the University Town Center," said Chancellor Greenwood. "The downtown location is ideal, bringing the classroom right into the heart of the Santa Cruz Community." Greenwood also noted that, "This project epitomizes the type of collaboration we strive for, one that involves and benefits the entire community. In this case, everyone from our students to downtown business owners to community members has reason to celebrate."
</p>
<p>
  UCSC Extension will offer more than 100 courses each quarter at the new downtown facility, including courses in the humanities, art and design, computing, education, and natural sciences. UCSC Extension is also conducting the English Language International (ELI) program at UTC. ELI serves the language and cultural needs of international students and professionals by providing courses in English proficiency and communications.
</p>
<p>
  Student residents and UCSC Extension staff moved into the new building in mid-September. Previously, UCSC Extension was located in the Galleria, off of Front Street where registration offices will be maintained. "The new University Town Center offers UCSC Extension the opportunity to expand and enhance our course offerings for residents of the Central Coast, " said Marcie Dekking, interim dean of UCSC Extension. "We are very pleased with the new location, which makes our programs more accessible to the community we aim to serve."
</p>
<p>
  One of the primary users of the new facility is UCSC Extension's English Language International Program, which offers five- and ten-week courses to those wishing to learn English. "The students in the international programs are taking full advantage of their opportunity to study and live at University Town Center," according to Judith McCarrick, assistant dean of UCSC Extension. "On-site housing facilitates the learning experience of our international students in numerous ways. They don't need to be distracted by transportation and other logistical concerns. Additionally, they have the added advantage of sharing space with English-speaking students, so that they can develop language skills outside of the classroom as well."
</p>
<p>
  The facility also assists in providing much-needed housing for UCSC students in Santa Cruz's tight housing market. Students who occupy the two-person apartments rent from UCSC's Housing, Dining, and Child Care Services program, which provides housing to approximately 5,200 UCSC students this year.

        <title>Faculty, staff invited to test-drive the 'car of the future'</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  For the second time in two months, the fleet of cars maintained by Transportation & Parking Services (TAPS) includes an all-electric car. Honda's electric vehicle, on loan from the California Environmental Protection Agency, is available for faculty and staff to test drive during the month of November. Any interested faculty and staff can take the car "out for a spin," whether their interest is job-related or merely personal, said Wes Scott, Fleet Services manager and director of TAPS. "We're just exposing people to the electric car."
</p>

<p>
  Earlier this fall, the state's EPA provided the campus with General Motor's all-electric car, the EV1. The vehicles have been taking a tour of city and county government agencies and educational institutions in the local area.<br>
  <br>
  Electric vehicles, because they rely on electrical power rather than fossil fuels, are being touted as "vehicles of the future" that will help reduce pollution and smog in California and other states.<br>
  <br>
  Automobile manufacturers are under mandate to make electric cars 10 percent of all vehicles sold in California by 2003--amounting to about 100,000 electric vehicles a year. The mandate is part of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.
</p>

<p>
  Fleet Services currently has no plans to purchase EV1s or other electric vehicles as part of the campus's fleet, said Scott. "As nice as it would be, it's not practical for us yet in terms of the costs and benefits," he said.
</p>

<p>
  For more information or to schedule a test-drive, call Wes Scott at (831) 459-4289.

        <title>Governor Davis signs 'agency shop' bill</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 01 Nov 1999 00:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>9008</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  Gov. Gray Davis has signed SB 645, a bill passed by the Legislature<br>
  requiring "agency shop" at the University of California and California<br>
  State University. The new law takes effect Jan. 1, 2000, and will result in<br>
  mandatory paycheck deductions for union-represented UC employees who do not currently pay union membership dues.<br>
  <br>
  The bill states that, "as a condition of continued employment," UC<br>
  employees who are in a bargaining unit exclusively represented by a union<br>
  must either join the union and pay its dues or pay a "fair share" fee to<br>
  the union. This fee would help cover the union's costs for negotiation,<br>
  contract administration and related activities.<br>
  <br>
  The amount of the "fair share" fee will be determined by each of the<br>
  University's unions. The bill states that the fee shall not exceed the<br>
  union's regular membership dues.<br>
  <br>
  UC faculty who are eligible for Academic Senate membership are exempt from<br>
  the bill.<br>
  <br>
  The University opposed the union-sponsored measure in the Legislature,<br>
  arguing that UC employees should have the opportunity to vote on any<br>
  "agency shop" arrangement before it is put into place. UC's view did not<br>
  prevail in the legislative process, however. The University now is<br>
  committed to fulfilling its legal obligations to implement the new law and<br>
  will be working with UC's unions on the details of implementation.<br>
  <br>
  According to the legislation, the "fair share" deductions are to begin<br>
  "upon notification to the employer by the exclusive representative," but no<br>
  sooner than Jan. 1. UC will be discussing the implementation timeline with<br>
  each of its unions and is currently examining the payroll processing<br>
  changes necessary to implement the "fair share" deductions. Additional<br>
  information about this process will be provided as it becomes available.<br>
  <br>
  The bill allows an employee "who is a member of a bona fide religion, body<br>
  or sect that has historically held conscientious objections to joining or<br>
  financially supporting public employee organizations" to instead pay an<br>
  amount equivalent to the "fair share" fee to a "nonreligious, nonlabor<br>
  charitable fund." The union and the University may designate a list of such<br>
  charitable funds to which conscientious objectors may direct their<br>
  contribution.<br>
  <br>
  Employees who are unsure if they are in a bargaining unit represented by a<br>
  union and thus affected by the new law should contact their supervisor or<br>
  their local Office of Labor Relations. Those with questions about the<br>
  details of implementation, including the amount of a union's "fair share"<br>
  fee or the procedures for conscientious objectors, should contact their<br>
  union directly.<br>
  <br>
  Under the legislation, the "agency shop" arrangement may be rescinded by a<br>
  majority vote of all employees in a bargaining unit if at least 30 percent<br>
  of the employees in that unit petition for such a vote. The election would<br>
  be administered by the state Public Employment Relations Board.<br>
  <br>
  Thirteen unions represent more than 60,000 UC employees in 31 bargaining<br>
  units. These unions and their corresponding bargaining units are:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Alameda County Building and Construction Trades Council (skilled crafts employees at UC Berkeley and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory);
  </li>
  <li>American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (Service Unit, Patient Care Technical Unit, and skilled crafts employees at UC Santa Cruz);
  </li>
  <li>American Federation of Teachers (Non-Senate Instructional Unit and Professional Librarian Unit);
  </li>
  <li>Association of Graduate Student Employees-United Auto Workers (local bargaining units of graduate teaching assistants, readers and tutors);
  </li>
  <li>California Nurses Association (Registered Nurse Unit);<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Coalition of University Employees (Clerical Unit);<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Federated University Police Officers Association (Police Officer Unit);<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>International Union of Operating Engineers (skilled crafts employees at UC Irvine, UCLA, UC Riverside, UC San Diego and UC Santa Barbara);
  </li>
  <li>Printing Trades Alliance (printing trades employees);<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Public Safety Officers Association (protective services officers at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory);
  </li>
  <li>San Francisco Building and Construction Trades Council (skilled crafts employees at UC San Francisco);
  </li>
  <li>Santa Cruz Faculty Association (UC Santa Cruz faculty); and
  </li>
  <li>University Professional and Technical Employees-Communications Workers of America (Technical Unit, Research Support Professional Unit and Residual Patient Care Professional Unit).
  </li>
</ul>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  UC Office of the President
</p>

<p>
  The University of California broke ground last week at its Washington Center in Washington D.C.<br>
  <br>
  When completed in the spring of 2001, the 11-story center will be a live-learn facility serving up to 280 undergraduate and graduate students and up to 10 visiting scholars. The center will offer living quarters for students and visiting scholars as well as offices and classrooms.<br>
  <br>
  The University of California currently has academic programs in the capital from UC campuses at Berkeley, Davis, Irvine, Los Angeles, San Diego, Santa Barbara, and Santa Cruz.<br>
  <br>
  UC undergraduates who come to Washington will typically spend a term in residence at the center while working and studying in the District of Columbia as part of each home campus's Washington program.<br>
  <br>
  "Over the years, students in the university's Washington programs have gained firsthand exposure to the political process while attaining incomparable experience as interns with federal agencies, Congress, the White House, policy research organizations, and interest groups," said UC President Richard C. Atkinson. "The new UC Center in Washington will enhance those educational opportunities as well as provide better facilities for scholars conducting Washington-based research."<br>
  <br>
  Larry Berman, a member and former chairman of the political science department at UC Davis, was appointed the center's director last September.<br>
  <br>
  Graduate fellows pursuing their doctoral research in Washington, D.C., will also work as teaching assistants in the center's classes of UC undergraduates.<br>
  <br>
  In addition to serving students and faculty, the center will be the Washington base for the Institute on Global Conflict and Cooperation, a multi-campus UC research unit whose mission is to bridge the gap between the academic and policy worlds. Also housed at the center will be the University of California's Office of Federal Governmental Relations.<br>
  <br>
  The center is being financed by a combination of public and private funds, including payments from students who will occupy the housing areas during their time in Washington.

<p>
  <font color="#000000">The proposed project is the construction of six residence halls (approximately 124,200 assignable square feet) and a dining hall (approximately 31,500 asf) on the Colleges Nine and Ten site north of McLaughlin Drive in the central UCSC campus. The residence halls would provide bed spaces for approximately 807 students. The dining hall building would house dining hall facilities for the residence halls and also a University Center, with a lounge, dining hall, kitchen, and conference rooms.</font><br>

<p>
  UCSC received a visit last week from a welcome guest--Eastman Kodak Company representative Pamela Zeh.
</p>Zeh was welcomed by Film and Digital Media professor and department chair Eli Hollander, who took her on a tour of Film and Digital Media facilities in the Communications Building. Zeh looked in on a film studio and screening, editing, and equipment rooms as well as several classes in progress.<br>
<br>
Zeh also met with facilities manager Paul Wrangell and later presented a plaque to Arts Dean Edward Houghton. The plaque recognized the academic excellence of UCSC's film program and marked the gift of $2,000 in film supplies from Kodak to UCSC.<br>
<br>
"Kodak's gift is a nice addition to our resources," said Hollander. "Because of this grant, we are able to introduce students to 16mm film in the introductory production class. It's an exceptional opportunity for them to be able to work with film at that level and shows them an important dimension in the field that they might not otherwise experience until much later in their course of studies."<br>
<br>
Kodak's support extends beyond the grant. In addition, the company will provide students with such resources as textbooks and access to training films. Zeh will return to UCSC several times over the course of the year to conduct sessions with Film and Digital Media students.<br>
<br>
This is the second year in a row that UCSC has received a grant from Kodak, which is based in Rochester, N.Y.

        <title>Students get hands-on experience in ecological restoration</title>

<p>
  <i>As manager of the Social Science Media Lab, photographer Jon Kersey tries to get out in the field to document some of the activities being pursued by faculty and students in the Social Sciences Division. Last winter, he photographed students in a restoration ecology laboratory class. Some of his photographs are currently on display in the lobby of Social Sciences I. The class will be offered again this winter.</i>
</p>Last winter, UCSC under- graduates in Karen Holl's restoration ecology lab class (<i>Environmental Studies 160L</i>) spent every Friday afternoon in the field, getting hands-on experience restoring part of the campus ecosystem.
<p>
  The lab section helped students integrate what they were learning<br>
  in class lectures. Students worked with Holl on a variety of restoration projects in the vicinity of the UCSC Campus, recording their observations, thoughts, and questions in field journals. The class project was to develop a monitoring program for Moore Creek and complete the first round of monitoring.
</p>
<p>
  For many students, the fieldwork helped them understand the complexities of ecological restoration, and it gave them a better grasp of the issues involved in the management of ecosystems.
</p>
<p>
  "<i>Restoration Ecology</i> was a great class," said Kristen Gillis. "Doing hands-on work in the field with other people was one of the most rewarding experiences that I had as an undergraduate at UCSC." Much of the field work took place on the UCSC Campus Natural Reserve, which was established to preserve significant natural features and diversity on the UCSC Campus in support of outdoor teaching, field research, and environmental interpretation. Areas of the reserve are experiencing the management issues discussed in class and serve as "real world" examples. Because there is no travel time to the reserve, four hours of work in the field is four hours in the field. If students need to follow up on something, they can easily return to a field location to check data.

<p>
  The course is intellectually and physically challenging, but it is a rewarding way to spend a Friday afternoon.

        <title>Redesigned campus calendar aids in event planning, publicity</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 25 Oct 1999 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>8998</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  The University Events Office has redesigned UCSC's Campus Calendar on the Web. In addition to a cleaner look and simpler interface, the <a href="http://events.ucsc.edu/calendar/">redesigned calendar</a> boasts new features to help sponsors of meetings, performances, lectures, and other campus functions plan and carry out their events, said Karen Hilker of University Events. With the new calendar:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Event sponsors and others can enter information about their events directly onto the Web calendar;
  </li>
  <li>Listings can be updated or corrected by sponsors at any time;
  </li>
  <li>Sponsors can indicate whether they want additional publicity from the listing, such as an on- or off-campus print calendar entry;
  </li>
  <li>Users can list events for planning purposes only and indicate that the event shouldn't be searchable on the Web calendar;
  </li>
  <li>Users can retrieve information via improved "search" and "help" functions.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  The benefits of placing a listing in the new calendar are threefold, said Hilker.<br>
  <br>
  First, the listing can help generate publicity for the event through the Web, on-campus publications, or outside media. Second, the calendar can help event planners across campus coordinate their events. Finally, the listings give University Events a "heads up" about the event so the office can provide assistance when needed.<br>
  <br>
  "We'll contact people if there are issues we can help them with, such as signage for the event, parking, or increased shuttle services," said Hilker.<br>
  <br>
  Event sponsors are encouraged to list information about their event as soon as possible, even if the information is incomplete, Hilker added.<br>
  <br>
  University Events uses the calendar information to generate several publicity opportunities, Hilker said. Event information may be included in calendar listings for <i>Currents,</i> <i>The Good Times,</i> KZSC, or the campus cable channel, or it can be printed on a weekly flyer that is distributed campuswide. Event sponsors may also request that their event not be publicized at all.<br>
  <br>
  To enter information onto the Web calendar, event sponsors must obtain a password from the University Events Office. For more information, call (831) 459-5390 or send e-mail to <a href="mailto:calendar@cats.ucsc.edu">calendar@cats.ucsc.edu</a>.

<p>
  Jean Fox Tree, an assistant professor of psychology at UCSC, was honored by the Division of Social Sciences last week for her excellence in teaching.
</p>Fox Tree, whose work was recently written up by the <i>New York Times</i> and featured on National Public Radio, specializes in speech comprehension. She received the Division of Social Sciences' 1998-99 Distinguished Teaching Award at an annual division convocation hosted by Dean Martin Chemers.
<p>
  The award, which recognizes outstanding undergraduate teaching in the social sciences, carries with it a $500 cash prize and an engraved plaque that features a "golden apple."<br>
  <br>
  "Jean Fox Tree's teaching evaluations from students are consistently enthusiastic, citing her lecture skills, her dedication, and her eagerness to share her material with undergraduates," said Chemers. "Her teaching inspires us all, and I am pleased to honor her work with this award."<br>
  <br>
  Fox Tree studies the role played in speech comprehension by words like um, uh, oh, I mean, and you know. These "discourse markers" are a hallmark of spontaneous speech but have been overlooked by most scholars, who consider them unimportant, even mistakes.
</p>
<p>
  Fox Tree's work has shown that these "throwaways" play specific roles in communication, sending signals to the listener to pay more attention, help the speaker find a word, or be patient while the speaker gathers his or her thoughts. Fox Tree suspects that rather than hindering comprehension, these cues actually help us understand each other.<br>
  <br>
  Fox Tree was selected by Chemers from a list of recommendations compiled by a faculty committee based on nominations put forth by department chairs. The committee was chaired by Daniel Press, Pepper-Giberson Associate Professor of Environmental Studies. The annual awards were established in 1991.<br>

        <title>Governor Davis signs 'agency shop' bill</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 25 Oct 1999 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>8995</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  Gov. Gray Davis has signed SB 645, a bill passed by the Legislature<br>
  requiring "agency shop" at the University of California and California<br>
  State University. The new law takes effect Jan. 1, 2000, and will result in<br>
  mandatory paycheck deductions for union-represented UC employees who do not currently pay union membership dues.<br>
  <br>
  The bill states that, "as a condition of continued employment," UC<br>
  employees who are in a bargaining unit exclusively represented by a union<br>
  must either join the union and pay its dues or pay a "fair share" fee to<br>
  the union. This fee would help cover the union's costs for negotiation,<br>
  contract administration and related activities.<br>
  <br>
  The amount of the "fair share" fee will be determined by each of the<br>
  University's unions. The bill states that the fee shall not exceed the<br>
  union's regular membership dues.<br>
  <br>
  UC faculty who are eligible for Academic Senate membership are exempt from<br>
  the bill.<br>
  <br>
  The University opposed the union-sponsored measure in the Legislature,<br>
  arguing that UC employees should have the opportunity to vote on any<br>
  "agency shop" arrangement before it is put into place. UC's view did not<br>
  prevail in the legislative process, however. The University now is<br>
  committed to fulfilling its legal obligations to implement the new law and<br>
  will be working with UC's unions on the details of implementation.<br>
  <br>
  According to the legislation, the "fair share" deductions are to begin<br>
  "upon notification to the employer by the exclusive representative," but no<br>
  sooner than Jan. 1. UC will be discussing the implementation timeline with<br>
  each of its unions and is currently examining the payroll processing<br>
  changes necessary to implement the "fair share" deductions. Additional<br>
  information about this process will be provided as it becomes available.<br>
  <br>
  The bill allows an employee "who is a member of a bona fide religion, body<br>
  or sect that has historically held conscientious objections to joining or<br>
  financially supporting public employee organizations" to instead pay an<br>
  amount equivalent to the "fair share" fee to a "nonreligious, nonlabor<br>
  charitable fund." The union and the University may designate a list of such<br>
  charitable funds to which conscientious objectors may direct their<br>
  contribution.<br>
  <br>
  Employees who are unsure if they are in a bargaining unit represented by a<br>
  union and thus affected by the new law should contact their supervisor or<br>
  their local Office of Labor Relations. Those with questions about the<br>
  details of implementation, including the amount of a union's "fair share"<br>
  fee or the procedures for conscientious objectors, should contact their<br>
  union directly.<br>
  <br>
  Under the legislation, the "agency shop" arrangement may be rescinded by a<br>
  majority vote of all employees in a bargaining unit if at least 30 percent<br>
  of the employees in that unit petition for such a vote. The election would<br>
  be administered by the state Public Employment Relations Board.<br>
  <br>
  Thirteen unions represent more than 60,000 UC employees in 31 bargaining<br>
  units. These unions and their corresponding bargaining units are:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Alameda County Building and Construction Trades Council (skilled crafts employees at UC Berkeley and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory);
  </li>
  <li>American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (Service Unit, Patient Care Technical Unit, and skilled crafts employees at UC Santa Cruz);
  </li>
  <li>American Federation of Teachers (Non-Senate Instructional Unit and Professional Librarian Unit);
  </li>
  <li>Association of Graduate Student Employees-United Auto Workers (local bargaining units of graduate teaching assistants, readers and tutors);
  </li>
  <li>California Nurses Association (Registered Nurse Unit);<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Coalition of University Employees (Clerical Unit);<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Federated University Police Officers Association (Police Officer Unit);<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>International Union of Operating Engineers (skilled crafts employees at UC Irvine, UCLA, UC Riverside, UC San Diego and UC Santa Barbara);
  </li>
  <li>Printing Trades Alliance (printing trades employees);<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Public Safety Officers Association (protective services officers at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory);
  </li>
  <li>San Francisco Building and Construction Trades Council (skilled crafts employees at UC San Francisco);
  </li>
  <li>Santa Cruz Faculty Association (UC Santa Cruz faculty); and
  </li>
  <li>University Professional and Technical Employees-Communications Workers of America (Technical Unit, Research Support Professional Unit and Residual Patient Care Professional Unit).
  </li>
</ul>

  <font color="#003399">UCSC Summer Session</font>
</h4>

<p>
  UCSC Summer Session has received this year's "Exemplary Programs Award" from the Western Association of Summer Session Administrators (WASSA) for the Seaside Junior High School Math/Science Institute. The institute was launched five years ago to reach out to young students in the Seaside area and bring them to campus for a challenging course of study and a residential life experience.<br>
  <br>
  Five of the the institute's "graduates" have applied to UCSC. Before attending the program, none of the students selected for the Seaside Junior High School Math/Science Institute had been to the campus and few had planned to seek degrees, according to Judith McCarrick, Summer Session dean.
</p>

<p>
  "I'm very pleased with the WASSA honor, but I'm more excited to think that our efforts are creating opportunities for students in our communities," said McCarrick.<br>
  <br>
  Summer Session also took fourth place for catalog design at the WASSA conference, where most member institutions submit their catalogs for critique.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  A fire that broke out in a UCSC science building late Wednesday afternoon (October 20) injured one student and caused minor damage to a chemistry laboratory. The fire was reported at 5:18 p.m. on the first floor of Sinsheimer Laboratories; it was extinguished in approximately 15 minutes.
</p>

<p>
  Juan Noveron, a graduate student working in the laboratory of Pradip Mascharak, a professor of chemistry, was taken by ambulance to Dominican Hospital in Santa Cruz for treatment of burns. He was listed in stable condition Wednesday night.
</p>

<p>
  The "flash" fire started after a small container of what is believed to be the solvent cyclohexane was accidentally overturned in an area where Noveron and a fellow graduate student were working. The fire was contained in one end of Mascharak's lab and caused no structural damage to the room, reported UCSC Fire Captain Don Brookes.
</p>

<p>
  In addition to a crew from UCSC's Fire Department, engines from the city of Santa Cruz and a hazardous materials truck from the Scotts Valley Fire Department responded to the fire call. Staff from the campus Office of Environmental Health & Safety also responded.

        <title>'New tango' master to perform at UCSC</title>

        <wp:post_id>8993</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_8992" align="alignright" width="200"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/1999/10/ziegler.99-10-18.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-8992" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/1999/10/ziegler.99-10-18.jpg" alt="The Pablo Ziegler Quintet for New Tango performs Thursday, October 28, at 8 p.m at UCSC's Music Center Recital Hall.

For tickets, call (831) 459-2159.[/caption]
<p>
  When he first introduced the world to "new" tango in the late 1940s and early '50s, Argentinian composer and bandoneon virtuoso Astor Piazzolla sparked responses ranging from perplexed to outraged. One critic was allegedly so infuriated that he burst in on a radio interview and put a gun to Piazzolla's head, evidently hoping to scare the composer out of his blasphemous ways.
</p>Happily, well before he died in 1992, Piazzolla came to be hailed for his role as the father of new tango, a jazz and classically influenced outgrowth of Argentina's famed music of the streets.<br>
<br>
But even to this day there are critics. Ask Pablo Ziegler. Ziegler, Piazzolla's pianist for a decade, now heads his own ensemble and is considered this generation's master of new tango.
<p>
  Ziegler's group, the Pablo Ziegler Quintet for New Tango, will perform at UCSC in late October as part of <a href="http://events.ucsc.edu/artslecs/">Arts & Lectures'</a> 1999-2000 season.<br>
  <br>
  "There are still many traditionalists today who object to new tango," he said. "To them, to change the tango is to change the national flag." Even his friends were dismayed when Ziegler told them he was leaving his jazz trio, Pablo Ziegler Terceto, to play with Piazzolla.
</p>
<p>
  "Ah, it was terrible," he recalled. "A lot of my friends were saying, 'No, this is not tango." I said, "Get out! This is wonderful tango. This is new tango. This is tango for now and for the next century.'"<br>
  <br>
  If any music is going to provoke such ardor, it's no surprise that it's tango: Born out of the the Buenos Aires ghettos at the turn of the 19th century, tango articulates the extremities of its world--passion, aggression, hope, fear. True to its roots, new tango voices the sultry inflections and seductive phrasings of traditional tango but creates a complex interplay with classical and jazz forms such as counterpoint, fugue, and improvisation.<br>
  <br>
  "Astor Piazzolla makes the big revolution in tango in 1946-48, taking it from the dance floor to the concert stage," Ziegler said. "He had a very good knowledge of the tongue of music--how different kinds of music speak together in harmony--and with that he really invents a new music."<br>
  <br>
  In 1978 Piazzolla was looking for a pianist and Ziegler, then 33, was his choice. Ziegler's background was eclectic: Trained from the age of 4 until 13 in a classical music conservatory, he learned tango on the side from his father, a tango violinist. As a teenager Ziegler fell in love with jazz, cutting his teeth on the likes of Chick Corea and Weather Report.
</p>
<p>
  Until he joined the Astor Piazzolla Quintet, Ziegler had never performed tango professionally, but his virtuosity in improvisation was exactly what Piazzolla wanted. "At that time, tango piano players only understood how to play straight tango," Ziegler explained. "Piazzolla wanted someone informed in classical and jazz."<br>
  <br>
  Although he had been playing professionally for nearly 20 years when he joined Piazzolla's quintet, Ziegler looks at his decade with the band as a learning experience.
</p>
<p>
  "It was the New Tango University for me," he said. And what Ziegler learned from his mentor was not just a musical style but the art of innovation. When he started his own quintet in 1992, Ziegler changed the mix, replacing the traditional violin with a drum.<br>
  <br>
  "I heard in my mind the sound of the quintet with drums and I wanted to try it," he explained. "New tango already has a complex rhythmical structure, but the drum gives us small possibilities of freedom--ways to explore with the rhythm."<br>
  <br>
  Another innovation was less intentional--and less successful. Ziegler launched his ensemble without tango's traditional bandoneon (a German accordion).
</p>
<p>
  "After playing with Piazzolla it was impossible for me to work with another bandoneon player. But I realized that tango without the bandoneon, it's like playing jazz without sax." Ziegler now performs with bandoneon player Hector del Curto. "He's fantastic," Ziegler said.<br>
  <br>
  Also performing with the quintet on this tour are Pablo Aslan on bass, guitarist Claudio Ragazzi, and drummer Satoshi Takeishi.<br>
  <br>
  As he added his own innovations, Ziegler says there is something he never forgets: "Tango comes from the dancers, from dancing close, and from the attitude, the <i>camorra</i> (cockiness). There is in tango an intense relationship between the man and the woman--sometimes provocative and sometimes very sweet. I try to maintain that relationship and to write the music to the relationship of the dancers.<br>
  <br>
  "The secret code to playing tango is to feel it in the body," he added. "I always say to the group, we must try to dance with the music. Because, if five musicians dance to the same rhythm you get fantastic results, no?"<br>
  <br>
  Judging by the fact that Ziegler has released three CDs in the last two years; is featured on the PBS special, "Tango Magic"; consistently arouses awe in even the most jaded music critics; and sells out shows months in advance; the results have been fantastic, yes.

        <title>UC works to meet challenge of 'Tidal Wave II'</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  UC Office of the President Facing dramatic enrollment growth over the next decade, the University of California is working aggressively to design ways of accommodating approximately 40 percent more students while preserving quality instructional and research programs, UC officials told the Board of Regents at its October 14 meeting. The university is pursuing a range of strategies for expanding capacity to meet enrollment demand, with a focus on creative solutions tailored to the needs of individual campuses and their surrounding communities. "The university is committed to accommodating the students who are headed our way," said UC President Richard C. Atkinson. "We absolutely must keep our promise of access to California's students, and we will do so in ways that maximize efficiency while preserving quality. "The challenge of enrollment growth presents the university with a tremendous opportunity--an opportunity to serve the educational needs of a growing and diverse population, and thus to expand the university's contributions to the economic and societal well-being of California as a whole," Atkinson said. The California Postsecondary Education Commission recently reported that between now and 2010, California's public institutions of higher education can expect enrollments to rise by more than 700,000 students. This enrollment surge, dubbed "Tidal Wave II" by former UC President Clark Kerr, is attributable to growth in the college-age population and anticipated increases in college participation rates, among other factors. UC fully intends to continue meeting its obligation under the Master Plan for Higher Education to enroll students from the top 12.5 percent of California's high school graduating class each year. As a result, the university expects enrollments on its general campuses to grow by approximately 60,000 full-time-equivalent students to a level of 210,000 by 2010. This increase equals the university's total enrollment growth over the last 30 years and also is equivalent to the existing enrollments of UC Berkeley and UCLA combined. UC enrollments also grew sharply in the 1960s. However, the growth now facing UC is expected to last for a longer period of time, and a smaller proportion of the growth will be absorbed by the development of new campuses. The university plans to open one new campus, UC Merced, in 2005 and enroll 5,000 students there by 2010. To accommodate the enrollment growth of the coming years, the university is pursuing a variety of other solutions, including:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Expanding instructional activity during the summer. Currently, student fees are higher for the summer session because it is not state-supported. To help ease the enrollment crunch, UC will increase instructional offerings in the summer, a step that will require state funding.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Enrolling more students at off-campus locations, such as the Education Abroad Program; the Washington, D.C., center; and new off-campus centers similar to those now operating in Ventura and Fresno. The university's 2000-01 budget proposal requests funding for development of another off-campus center in the Santa Clara Valley (read <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/messages/99-00/mrc.10-14.htm">Chancellor Greenwood's message</a>).<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Expanding regular enrollments during the fall, winter, and spring quarters, with sensitivity to the concerns of the campuses' surrounding communities.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>Continuing to improve students' time to graduation. Currently, UC students graduate in 13 quarters on average. The university will continue working to facilitate students' ability to earn a diploma in 12 quarters.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>
  Each campus will pursue the strategies that best fit local needs. UC will send a report to the legislature in April 2000 providing further details about the university's planning.<br>
  <br>
  Atkinson emphasized that meeting the enrollment challenge will not be a simple task and will require the support of the state as a whole. Campus growth, along with upgrades of existing facilities, will require $500 million per year in capital funding. The university will need to hire approximately 3,000 new faculty members for enrollment growth alone. Student services, from housing to advising, will likewise require expansion.<br>
  <br>
  UC must also continue to receive the operating budget support necessary to preserve the high-quality programs that attract students to the university in the first place, Atkinson said.<br>
  <br>
  "We will grow wisely, we will be innovative, and we will work cooperatively with our neighbors and with our partners in the other segments of higher education," Atkinson said. "This is not a challenge we can tackle alone. It truly is an issue of shared responsibility for California's children, and for the future of the state."

        <title>Psychology professor testifies in Y2K court case</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 18 Oct 1999 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>8985</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  If you think that new computer you bought is Y2K compliant, check again.<br>
  <br>
  That advice comes from Anthony Pratkanis, a professor of psychology at UCSC, who is testifying in a high-profile court case in which plaintiffs are charging that major computer retailers like Circuit City and Staples are misleading consumers about the Y2K-readiness of their products.<br>
  <br>
  "Basically, consumers think computers and software will continue to work after the first of the year," said Pratkanis. "The lawsuit alleges that is not necessarily the case, even with computers and software being sold today, because some products are still not Y2K compliant."<br>
  <br>
  An expert on consumer psychology, Pratkanis conducted a survey of consumer attitudes for the plaintiff's attorneys in <i>Johnson v. Circuit City Store, Inc., et al.</i><br>
  <br>
  Filed in Superior Court in Contra Costa County in January, the lawsuit originally named seven retailers: Circuit City, CompUSA, Office Max, The Good Guys, Staples, Fry's Electronics, and Office Depot. In June, Office Depot became the first defendant to settle; Fry's followed suit and settled out of court in September.<br>
  <br>
  The lawsuit claims that the retailers are failing to warn customers of potential Y2K problems in the products they sell. Pratkanis is one of two experts in the case. A computer expert from the University of Texas at Austin is testifying that certain products are not Y2K compliant, including Windows 98. For his part, Pratkanis has submitted written testimony asserting that consumers in California are unaware of the problem and think that if a retailer is offering a product for sale in 1999, it will work a few months later in the year 2000.<br>
  <br>
  As part of its settlement, which included a cash settlement, Fry's has agreed to train its employees on Y2K issues and disclosures, post "prominent" signs, and pass out brochures on how consumers can contact computer and software manufacturers to confirm that products are Y2K compliant. Office Depot agreed to warn consumers that some computer products it sells may not work properly after December 31, 1999.<br>
  <br>
  In July, Contra Costa Superior Court Judge Trembath denied the retailers' request to include software manufacturers as defendants in the class action, but the defendants successfully removed the lawsuit to federal court in what likely sets the stage for the first attempt to invoke a new federal law limiting year 2000 lawsuits (the "Y2K Act," Public Law No. 10637).<br>
  <br>
  Plaintiff Tom Johnson's attorneys argue that the defendants are misrepresenting the Y2K-readiness of the products they sell, as well as misinforming consumers about the least expensive means of achieving Y2K-readiness. Such business practices create a false sense of Y2K-readiness among California consumers, according to the plaintiff's attorneys, who cite Pratkanis's expert testimony in their arguments.

        <title>Students put colorful countenance on Cowell quad</title>

(View photo of artists.)" width="157" height="245" /></a>The Maternal Tree mural was designed to make Cowell College a welcoming place. (View photo of artists.)[/caption]
<p>
  What started as a brainstorming session has blossomed into a brilliant 13- by 25-foot mural on the side of a Cowell residential house.
</p>The mural, titled <i>The Maternal Tree,</i> was conceived and brought about by people affiliated with Cowell College, most of whom were members of Cowell's Multi-Cultural Advisory Board.
<p>
  The idea originated during a meeting of students who wanted to find ways to make the college feel as welcoming as possible to a diverse group of people. The group settled on the idea of a mural that would represent a diversity of cultures and beliefs.<br>
  <br>
  Once the idea received support from the Cowell Assembly (a quorum of Cowell students, faculty, and staff), and the funding was in place, mural committee members called the Santa Cruz Art League for recommendations on area artists.
</p>
<p>
  Last spring, after interviewing a number of artists, the group settled on artists Ralph D'Oliveira, who graduated from Oakes in 1977, Guillermo Aranda, and Lorena Castillo. The trio designed the mural based on student input and set about painting it this fall with student help. By the time the project was completed last week, more than 100 students had lent a hand in the painting process.<br>
  <br>
  A celebration and dedication will take place as part of Cowell's College Night on Thursday, October 21. The event includes dinner, a presentation by the artists, and a concert and dessert reception.<br>
  <br>
  The program is free and open to the public. The dinner costs $3 to $5 and advance reservations are required for the dinner only. Dinner begins at 6 p.m., followed at 6:45 p.m. by the presentation and dedication. Performing at the dedication will be the Latin American music ensemble Chuchumbe. For dinner reservations or more information, call (831) 459-2255.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  Four graduate students at UCSC have received Ford Foundation fellowships totaling nearly $80,000. Luz Calvo, a graduate student studying history of consciousness, received a $21,500 "dissertation fellows" award. In addition, three other graduate students received $14,000 fellowships plus payment of academic fees--amounting to nearly $19,000 per student--as "predoctoral fellows." They are, with their areas of study: Maricela Correa, psychology; Jennifer N. Goodyear-Ka'Opua, history of consciousness; and Araceli Valle, psychology. The fellowships are administered by the National Research Council of the National Academies and are designed to increase the presence of underrepresented minorities on the nation's college and university faculties. The awards were presented earlier this month at the National Research Council's annual meeting in Washington, D.C. The four UCSC fellowships are among 117 nationally competitive grants the Ford Foundation awarded this year. For more information, call the National Research Council's Fellowship Programs at (202) 334-2872, send e-mail to <a href="mailto:infofell@nas.edu">infofell@nas.edu</a>, or to go the National Academies' <a href="http://fellowships.nas.edu">Web site</a>.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  Winona LaDuke, one of the nation's leading Native American and environmental activists, is coming to campus on Tuesday, October 26, at 8 p.m. LaDuke will speak and read from her new book, <i>All Our Relations: Native Struggles for Land and Life.</i> Her talk will take place in the Kresge Town Hall. The event is free and open to the public. LaDuke is an enrolled member of the Mississippi band of Anishinaabeg and became involved in Native American environmental issues while studying at Harvard University. LaDuke movingly describes native people's resistance to environmental and cultural degradation and presents a vision of political, spiritual, and ecological transformation. LaDuke is executive director of Honor the Earth, which supports native communities on the front lines of environmental protection in North America. She is founding director of the White Earth Land Recovery Project and is cochair of the Indigenous Women's Network and a board member of Greenpeace, USA. In 1994, she was named by <i>Time</i> magazine as one of America's 50 most promising leaders under 40 years of age. In the 1996 presidential campaign, she served as Ralph Nader's running mate for the Green Party, and in 1997, with the Indigo Girls, she was named a woman of the year by <i>Ms.</i> magazine. In 1988, she received the Reebok Human Rights Award. LaDuke's visit is being cosponsored by the UCSC Women's Center, women's studies, the Native American Studies Research Cluster, American studies, cultural studies, environmental studies, and literature.

        <title>UC establishes task force on minority medical school enrollment</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 11 Oct 1999 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>8977</wp:post_id>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  <a href="mailto:stephens@cats.ucsc.edu"></a>
</p>

<p>
  The University of California is establishing a task force to examine declines in the enrollment of first-year underrepresented students at the university's five medical schools.<br>
  <br>
  Citing a 12.5 percent drop from last year, President Richard C. Atkinson is directing the task force to:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>examine the reasons for this decline, given that the number of admission offers to underrepresented students increased nearly 30 percent this year;
  </li>
  <li>assess longer-term trends in underrepresented minority enrollment in the university's medical schools and their implications for both education and access to health care; and
  </li>
  <li>recommend steps that UC can take to encourage more underrepresented students to choose health sciences careers, prepare them for admission and recruit them to UC.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Atkinson will ask the task force to complete its work by next spring.<br>
  <br>
  "We know that many factors, from the availability of scholarships to geographical location, influence students' choices about medical school," said Atkinson. "But a significant number of underrepresented students accepted at UC this year chose to go elsewhere, and understanding why could make a difference to our outreach efforts."<br>
  <br>
  The university's five medical schools enrolled 569 first-year students this fall. A total of 196 admissions offers were made to underrepresented minority students. Some students likely received offers from more than one UC medical school. Last year, 151 admission offers were made.
</p>

<p>
  Despite the 30 percent increase in the number of admissions offers this fall, acceptances from underrepresented students dropped to 63 from the previous year's 72, a decline of 12.5 percent.<br>
  <br>
  This year's figures continue a downward trend that began in 1993. Data prepared by the American Association of Medical Colleges shows that as recently as the early 1990s, four of UC's five medical schools ranked within the top eight medical schools nationally in the percentage of their graduates who were underrepresented students.<br>
  <br>
  UC Vice President for Health Affairs Cornelius L. Hopper will chair the task force, which will look at both short-and long-term trends in the admission and enrollment of underrepresented minorities, among them African Americans, Mexican Americans and Native Americans.<br>
  <br>
  "The continuing decline in enrollment of underrepresented students is particularly disturbing in view of the increasing diversity of the state and the university's prior record in this area," said Hopper.
</p>

<p>
  "We believe that expanding the number of underrepresented students trained by UC medical schools is one vital dimension of our efforts to improve access to care for medically underserved groups and communities in California."<br>
  <br>
  Hopper has served as vice president of health affairs for the last 16 of his 20 years with the university. His responsibilities include long-range planning for the health sciences, liaison with the California Legislature on health sciences education and clinical programs, and administration of statewide programs in geriatrics, AIDS, tobacco-related diseases, and breast cancer. He will retire as vice president for health affairs in January 2000, but at Atkinson's request he has agreed to serve as chair of the task force until it has completed its work.<br>
  <br>
  Data on fall 1999 medical school enrollments is available at:<br>

  <font color="#003399">Public hearing on Physical Sciences Building EIR to be held October 19</font>
</h4>

<p>
  The campus Environmental Assessment Group is preparing a Draft Environmental Impact Report (DEIR) for the new Physical Sciences Building. The proposed project is the construction of an approximately five-story, approximately 78,500-assignable-square- feet Physical Sciences Building on the site of an existing parking lot just southeast of the intersection of McLaughlin Drive and Steinhart Way in the central campus. The building would accommodate programs in chemistry, environmental toxicology, and engineering.<br>
  <br>
  A public hearing will be held on October 19 between 6 and 8 p.m., at the Barn Theater. At this meeting, campus planners will provide a description of the project and its environmental effects, and members of the public will be invited to give oral comments on the Draft EIR for the project. Call Ann Bertken at (831) 459-4760 for additional information or to request accommodations for persons with disabilities.
</p>

<h4>
  <font color="#003399">G-FEST Film Festival</font>
</h4>

<p>
  G-FEST Film Festival will take place on Saturday, October 23, from 7 to 10 p.m. in Classroom Unit 2. Come and enjoy an evening of adrenaline and watch the very best high-risk action sport films from around the world. Skiing, surfing, skydiving, climbing, skating, biking and more. G-FEST is about the intersection of art and sport--wild nail-biting, sweat-soaked moving pictures, and stills of people harnessing gravity (the g- get it?). The cost is $6/student and $7/community. Sponsored by the Recreation Office.
</p>

<h4>
  <font color="#003399">EEO/AA Office launching campuswide exit interview program</font>
</h4>

<p>
  Over the past year, the number of career employees who have separated from UCSC has doubled from the previous year. To better understand the variables that affect staff employee retention, the EEO/AA Office launched a campuswide exit interview program October 1. At the beginning of each month, the EEO/AA office will send an exit interview questionnaire to all career staff who have separated from the university during the previous month. The option for an in-person interview will be made available, with EEO/AA staff doing those interviews as requested.<br>
  <br>
  After one year of collecting this information, EEO/AA will issue a report with recommendations for action. The interviews will help to identify where improvements can be made to campus climate, management, and conditions of employment for staff. The interviews may help identify the campus's strengths as an employer as well. Units currently conducting exit interviews are encouraged to continue and to use the information to positively impact retention. For more information about the exit interview program, contact Lynda Tanaka at (831) 459-2686, tanaka@cats.ucsc.edu.

</p>

<p>
  <b>Anthony Pratkanis</b> of psychology was interviewed by <i>Details</i> magazine about the effects of advertising clutter on persuasion.<br>
  <br>
  KION is also featuring professor of earth sciences <b>Karen McNally</b> in a series of reports leading up to the 10th anniversary of the Loma Prieta earthquake.
</p>

<p>
  <b>Michael Brown</b> of politics did a live interview on KUSP Radio, discussing his new book <i>Race, Money, and the American Welfare State.</i>

        <title>Surprise grant will make rare slides available to public</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 11 Oct 1999 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>8973</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_8972" align="alignright" width="200"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/1999/10/decou.99-10-11.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-8972" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/1999/10/decou.99-10-11.jpg" alt="A scene from Salerno, Italy (view larger image) Photo: Branson DeCou" width="200" height="184" /></a>A scene from Salerno, Italy (view larger image) Photo: Branson DeCou[/caption]
<p>
  Since 1971, Slide Collections in the <a href="http://library.ucsc.edu/library/">University Library</a> has been the home of the archive of photographer Branson DeCou. But, because DeCou produced mainly lantern slides, the delicate and dated format of the slides (imprinted on glass and twice as big as modern 35 mm slides) made them impractical for general use.
</p>
<p>
  Ironically, the DeCou slides are going from obsolete to cutting edge in one fell swoop, thanks to a grant from a New York foundation.<br>
</p><br>
The $14,000 grant comes from the <a href="http://www.delmas.org/%20homepage.html">Gladys Krieble Delmas Foundation</a> and will fund the purchase of a state-of-the-art slide scanner and the scanning, researching, and cataloguing of 1,000 of the 10,000 DeCou slides in the collection. The slides are ones that portray life in Italy, a special area of interest for the Delmas Foundation.
<p>
  The grant helps put the University Library at the forefront of online cataloguing as well by supporting the transition from text-only catalog entries to text and visual entries.
</p>
<p>
  "The whole point in getting this grant is to make these slides accessible," says arts bibliographer and slide librarian Christine Bunting, who worked on the grant proposal and will oversee the project. "Our goal is to put these up as an educational Web site and to link the pictorial representations to our slide records," she adds.
</p>
<p>
  The news of the Delmas grant was somewhat unexpected. Although she had written a letter of inquiry, library development officer and librarian Margaret Gordon was expecting the result to be an invitation to apply for a grant. Instead, the foundation's response was a pledge of $14,000.
</p>
<p>
  The Delmas Foundation supports humanities scholarship, performing arts in New York City, research library programs, and Venetian studies.
</p>
<p>
  DeCou, a native of Philadelphia, had traveled the world by the time he was 20, documenting the life, industry, and culture of Europe and America in the 1910s to 1940s--a world that rapidly transformed in the aftermath of World War II. His black- -and white images captured vendors and artisans at work, architectural views, photographs of public monuments, sculptures, and frescoes. DeCou earned part of his living by presenting lecture tours at which he showed his beautiful hand-tinted slides to the accompaniment of music played on a Victrola.
</p>
<p>
  Librarians are looking to October 2000 to have the work on the DeCou Italian collection available online. The images and corresponding catalog records will be included in <a href="http://slides-www.ucsc.edu/slidecat/slidecat.html">SlideCat</a>, the library's Web-based slide catalog, which is recognized as among the most comprehensive and sophisticated in the nation. The records will be made accessible via the <a href="http://www.cdlib.org/">California Digital Library</a>, the Online Archive of California, and other significant specialized Web sites in art history and visual culture.

<h3>
  'Huffman Codes' used in fax machines, modems, other applications involving the compression of data
</h3>
<p>
  and <a href="mailto:jrburns@cats.ucsc.edu">Jim Burns</a>
</p>
<p>
  David A. Huffman, the founding faculty member of the Computer Science Department and a pioneer in the field, died at a local hospital on Thursday, October 7, after a 10-month battle with cancer. He was 74.
</p>"Besides being a dear friend and a great colleague, David was one of the grand men in his field," said Patrick Mantey, dean of UCSC's Jack Baskin School of Engineering. "He made major contributions not only to the fields of computing and information science, but also to the development of the School of Engineering at UCSC, so this is a great loss."
<p>
  A memorial service for Huffman is planned, but no details are available at this time.
</p>
<p>
  Huffman is probably best known for the development of the Huffman Coding Procedure, the result of a term paper he wrote while a graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). "Huffman Codes" are used in nearly every application that involves the compression and transmission of digital data, such as fax machines, modems, computer networks, and high-definition television.
</p>
<p>
  Huffman joined the faculty at MIT in 1953. In 1967, he came to UC Santa Cruz as the founding faculty member of the Computer Science Department. He played a major role in the development of the department's academic programs and the hiring of its faculty, and served as chair from 1970 to 1973. He retired in 1994, but remained active until recently as an emeritus professor, teaching information theory and signal analysis courses.
</p>
<p>
  Huffman made important contributions in many different areas, including information theory and coding, signal designs for radar and communications applications, and design procedures for asynchronous logical circuits. As an outgrowth of his work on the mathematical properties of "zero curvature" surfaces, Huffman developed his own techniques for folding paper into unusual sculptured shapes.
</p>
<p>
  Huffman's accomplishments earned him numerous awards and honors. Most recently, he received the 1999 Richard W. Hamming Medal from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) in recognition of his exceptional contributions to information sciences. He also received the Louis E. Levy Medal of the Franklin Institute for his doctoral thesis on sequential switching circuits, a Distinguished Alumnus Award from Ohio State University, and the W. Wallace McDowell Award. He was a charter recipient of the Computer Pioneer Award from the IEEE Computer Society, and he received a Golden Jubilee Award for Technological Innovation from the IEEE Information Theory Society in 1998.
</p>
<p>
  A native of Ohio, Huffman earned his bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from Ohio State University at the age of 18. He then served in the U.S. Navy as a radar maintenance officer on a destroyer that helped to clear mines in Japanese and Chinese waters after World War II. He subsequently earned his master's degree from Ohio State and his doctorate from MIT, also in electrical engineering.
</p>
<p>
  David Huffman is survived by his wife, Marilyn Huffman, of Santa Cruz; his former wife, Jane Ayres Huffman; their two daughters, Elise and Linda Huffman, both of Santa Cruz; their son, Stephen Huffman, of Santa Cruz; a son-in-law, Jeff Grubb, of Santa Cruz; a stepdaughter, Marti Homer Kehlet, of Sacramento, her husband, Daret, and their daughter, Karsen; a stepson, Darin Homer of Prunedale, his wife, Jane, and their son, Ryan; and a brother, Donald Huffman, of Westerville, Ohio, his wife, Jean, and their family.
</p>
<p>
  At the family's request, contributions in David Huffman's name may be made to the Hospice Caring Project of Santa Cruz County or the American Cancer Society, Santa Cruz Chapter.

  Recent observations of very distant exploding stars have provided evidence that the expansion of the universe is speeding up with time rather than slowing down as cosmologists had expected. These observations, called the Science Breakthrough of 1998 by <i>Science</i> magazine, revived the idea of a long-range "anti-gravity" effect in the universe. UC Berkeley astronomer Alex Filippenko, a prominent member of an international team that first reported these striking findings, will discuss their implications on Tuesday, October 26, in a public lecture at UCSC. His talk, "Einstein's Biggest Blunder? The Case for Cosmic 'Anti-gravity,'" will begin at 8 p.m. in Classroom Unit 2. Admission is free. Albert Einstein introduced the idea of a "cosmological constant," a long-range repulsive effect in the universe, because he believed the universe to be static and recognized that gravity should make it contract. When Edwin Hubble discovered that the universe is actually expanding, Einstein renounced the cosmological constant, calling it the biggest blunder of his career. Ever since, cosmologists have assumed that the universe began in an expanding state (the Big Bang) and that gravity has gradually slowed down this expansion. Now, however, Filippenko's group and another independent team of researchers have found strong evidence that the expansion of the universe is actually accelerating with time. They based this startling conclusion on observations of very distant supernovae, exploding stars that shine very brightly and can be used as beacons for measuring great distances in the universe. In order to explain these findings, cosmologists have revived Einstein's cosmological constant, a positive force countering the effect of gravity and propelling the continued expansion of the universe. The implications are that the universe will expand forever and that space is geometrically flat on large scales. The age of the universe derived from this model is 14 billion years, consistent with the ages of the oldest known stars. In his talk, Filippenko will present an overview of this research and discuss its implications. Filippenko's research accomplishments have been recognized by several major awards, including the American Astronomical Society's Pierce Prize and the Canadian Astronomical Society's Petrie Prize.
</p>

<p>
  A dedicated and enthusiastic instructor, he has won the top teaching awards at UC Berkeley, and in 1995 was voted the "Best Professor" on campus in an informal student poll. Recently, he produced a 40-lecture video course on introductory astronomy with The Teaching Company.<br>
  <br>
  Filippenko's talk is the first of the Halliday Lectures, a new series of public lectures presented by UCSC's Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics. The lecture series is supported by a gift from John and Layne Halliday. John Halliday is a trustee and former president of the UC Santa Cruz Foundation.<br>
  <br>
  Parking is available in the lot at Hahn Student Services, down the hill from Classroom Unit 2, or at the East Field House. For more information, please call the UCSC Public Information Office at (831) 459-2495.<br>

        <title>Anthropologist kicks off lecture series with talk about Chinese healing practices</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 11 Oct 1999 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_8966" align="alignright" width="200"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/1999/10/chen_nancy.99-10-11.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-8966" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/1999/10/chen_nancy.99-10-11.jpg" alt="Nancy Chen" width="200" height="225" /></a>Nancy Chen[/caption]
<p>
  Qigong, an ancient Chinese healing practice that integrates movement and breathing, made headlines last summer when the Chinese government publicly cracked down on practitioners of falun gong, a spinoff that combines qigong exercises with Buddhist and Taoist cultivation practices.
</p>Qigong, pronounced "chee-gong," is associated with a broad range of mental and physical exercises that are considered beneficial to health. Practiced by more than 100 million people, qigong was recently introduced to the U.S. public on Bill Moyers's popular PBS-TV series "Healing and the Mind."
<p>
  Come learn about qigong and the cultural politics of healing practices in China and the United States during a free public talk by UCSC anthropologist Nancy Chen. During her talk, entitled "The Culture and Politics of Qi (Chi)," Chen will discuss what prompted the government crackdown, and she will offer a bigger framework within which to understand qigong.
</p>
<p>
  Chen will discuss the rise of qigong and the intimate link between movements of breath and body and social movements. Chen will also compare the politics of medicine in China with the United States, where qigong has also become popular.
</p>
<p>
  A medical anthropologist and an assistant professor of anthropology at UCSC, Chen researches traditional healing, mental health, and the pharmaceutical industry. She is also interested in the continuum between food and medicine as well as the uses of science in the building of nations. Her forthcoming book "Breathing Spaces: Qigong, Psychiatry, and Body Politics of Late Twentieth-Century China," addresses the reemergence of alternative healing practices relative to state systems of medicine such as traditional Chinese medicine or psychiatry.
</p>
<p>
  Chen's talk is the inaugural lecture in the 1999-2000 Humanities Lecture Series, sponsored jointly by UCSC's Humanities Division and the Museum of Art and History. It takes place from 7 to 8 p.m. on Thursday, October 14, at the Museum of Art and History at the McPherson Center, 705 Front St., Santa Cruz. The talk is free and open to the public. A reception follows.
</p>

        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  The Science Matters Book Club, which meets each month at the Central Branch of the Santa Cruz Public Library, holds its meeting for next month on Sunday, October 17, from 2 to 4 p.m. Mike Dalbey, a lecturer in biology at UCSC, will lead a discussion of Jared Diamond's Pulitzer Prize-winning book <i>Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies.</i><br>
  <br>
  The book club is open to the general public and focuses on nontechnical science books. Each discussion is led by a member of the local scientific community with expertise in the subject of that month's book. Meetings are usually on the third Sunday of each month.<br>
  <br>
  The book club is sponsored by the Santa Cruz Public Libraries, the UCSC Science Library, the Cabrillo College Library, the Association for Women in Science-Monterey Bay, the Capitola Book Cafe, and the Santa Cruz City Museum of Natural History. The Capitola Book Cafe offers a 10 percent discount to members of the book club for the monthly selections.<br>
  <br>
  "This book club was created to provide a forum for readers of lay science books to be able to ask questions of professionals in the field," said Victoria Welborn, reference librarian at the UCSC Science Library. "It also provides a forum for scientists to discuss their work with nonscientists."<br>
  <br>
  For more information about the Science Matters Book Club, contact Victoria Welborn at (831) 459-2816 or <a href="mailto:welborn@cats.ucsc.edu">welborn@cats.ucsc.edu</a>. Information is also available on the Web at <a href="http://www.santacruzpl.org/science">www.santacruzpl.org/science</a>.

        <title>ACE Honors Program wins Presidential award</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 11 Oct 1999 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>

        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  The Academic Excellence (ACE) Honors Program has been selected to receive the 1999 Presidential Award for Excellence in Science, Mathematics, and Engineering Mentoring. The national award, administered and funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF), includes a $10,000 grant and a Presidential certificate. Nancy Cox-Konopelski, director of the <a href="http://natsci.ucsc.edu/acad/ace/index.html">ACE Honors Program</a>, will accept the award in a ceremony at the White House later this year. UCSC is among five institutions and ten individuals to receive the award this year. The Division of Natural Sciences established the ACE program in 1986 to help students succeed in entry-level undergraduate science courses. The program focuses on attracting, retaining, and advancing underrepresented undergraduate students who are pursuing math- and science-related careers at UCSC.
</p>

<p>
  Through a combination of collaborative problem-solving sessions and one-on-one peer mentoring, ACE provides a setting in which students master the course material while developing critical thinking and problem-solving skills.<br>
  <br>
  "The ACE Honors Program is unique because it is cocurricular rather than extra-curricular," Cox-Konopelski said.<br>
  <br>
  Over the past 12 years, the ACE program has helped approximately 2,000 students succeed in introductory-level courses in biology, calculus, chemistry, and physics. ACE students earn about 5 percent more A and B grades in their courses than students at large do. Their graduation rates and participation in undergraduate research are also higher than average.<br>
  <br>
  "No personal influence is as powerful, long-lasting, and positive as that of a superlative mentor," said NSF director Rita Colwell. "The mentors receiving this award are a true national resource who play a key role in defining the quality of our nation's future human resources in science, mathematics, technology, and engineering."

  <font color="#003399">Elizabeth Irwin</font>
</h4>Elizabeth Irwin, director of Public Affairs, has been selected as one of the "People of the Century" by the Aptos Chamber of Commerce. Irwin is among 23 people, businesses, and organizations so honored for giving their time, money, and energy to make Santa Cruz County a better place to live in the 20th century. The honorees were celebrated at the chamber's 69th annual dinner and auction at Seascape Resort on October 2.
<p>
  Before coming to UCSC in 1995, Irwin was assistant dean of Community Education and director of Marketing and Communications at Cabrillo College. She has also served on the board of directors of the Cultural Council of Santa Cruz County, as vice president of the Pajaro Valley Chamber of Commerce, president of the Aptos Chamber of Commerce, and president of the Cabrillo Music Festival. In 1992 the Aptos Chamber of Commerce also chose Irwin as the organization's "Woman of the Year."

  A film by community studies lecturer Geoffrey Dunn was featured last spring in a film series presented by the Guggenheim Museum on the Philippine-American War in 1899. The film, <i>A Dollar a Day, Ten Cents a Dance: A Historic Portrait of Filipino Farm Workers in America</i> (coproduced in 1984 with Mark Schwartz) chronicles the story of Filipino immigrants who came to the U.S. in the 1920s and 30s. The Guggenheim series was titled "Empire and Memory: Repercussions and Evocations of the 1899 Philippine-American War" and featured some two dozen films on the subject, including a 16 mm piece produced in 1899 by Thomas Edison.

  <font color="#003399">EEO/AA Office launching campuswide exit interview program</font>
</h4>

<p>
  Over the past year, the number of career employees who have separated from UCSC has doubled from the previous year. To better understand the variables that affect staff employee retention, the EEO/AA Office is launching a campuswide exit interview program starting October 1. At the beginning of each month, the EEO/AA office will send an exit interview questionnaire to all career staff who have separated from the university during the previous month. The option for an in-person interview will be made available, with EEO/AA staff doing those interviews as requested.<br>
  <br>
  After one year of collecting this information, EEO/AA will issue a report with recommendations for action. The interviews will help to identify where improvements can be made to campus climate, management, and conditions of employment for staff. The interviews may help identify the campus's strengths as an employer as well. Units currently conducting exit interviews are encouraged to continue and to use the information to positively impact retention. For more information about the exit interview program, contact Lynda Tanaka at (831) 459-2686, tanaka@cats.ucsc.edu.

        <title>UCSC engineer awarded $625,000 Packard Fellowship</title>

        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_8957" align="alignright" width="180"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/1999/10/shakouri.99-10-04.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-8957" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/1999/10/shakouri.99-10-04.jpg" alt="Ali Shakouri" width="180" height="247" /></a>Ali Shakouri[/caption]
<p>
  For the sixth consecutive year, a UCSC researcher has garnered one of the nation's most prestigious honors for young faculty members: a David and Lucile Packard Fellowship for Science and Engineering, worth a total of $625,000.
</p><br>
Ali Shakouri, an assistant professor of electrical engineering in the Jack Baskin School of Engineering, will receive $125,000 per year for the next five years to support his pioneering research on semiconductor physics and optical communication systems. The Packard Foundation awards these fellowships to young scientists and engineers who show exceptional promise and creativity.<br>
<br>
Shakouri's research on the electrical, optical, and thermal properties of semiconductors has many potential applications, such as improving the performance of electronic devices, increasing the speed of fiber-optic networks, and developing novel devices with new functions and applications.<br>
<br>
As computer chips keep getting smaller and their speed of operation increases, the amount of heat they generate has become an important issue. Shakouri has been working on a collaborative project with researchers at other universities and in industry to develop new ways of cooling computer chips based on the thermoelectric effects in semiconductor devices made from ultrathin layers of crystalline materials.<br>
<br>
According to Shakouri, learning to manipulate the thermal properties of semiconductors can have additional payoffs far beyond the prevention of overheating in high-speed computer chips. Just as the diodes and transistors that make up computer circuit boards are based on the optimization and control of the electrical properties of semiconductors, and the diode lasers and detectors used in fiber-optic networks are based on control of the optical properties of semiconductors, a whole new category of electronic devices may be possible by capitalizing on the combined electrical, optical, and thermal properties of semiconductors.<br>
<br>
"We already have many useful optoelectronic devices, and there is a lot of potential to explore novel opto-thermo-electronic components," Shakouri said.<br>
<br>
Such devices might be able to operate at higher speeds or tolerate greater temperature extremes than existing devices can. For example, Shakouri plans to investigate the design of high-power, high-speed semiconductor lasers for use in fiber-optic telecommunication networks and other applications.<br>
<br>
Shakouri earned a degree in engineering from the Ecole Nationale Superieure des Telecommunications in Paris, France, and an M.S. and Ph.D. in electrical engineering from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) in Pasadena. He was an assistant research engineer at UC Santa Barbara before joining the faculty of the Jack Baskin School of Engineering in 1998.<br>
<br>
The Packard Fellowship program, established in 1988, is intended to provide support for unusually creative science and engineering researchers early in their careers, allowing them to pursue their research with few funding restrictions and limited paperwork requirements. Every year, the Packard Foundation invites 50 universities to nominate two young faculty members for the fellowships.<br>
<br>
The David and Lucile Packard Foundation, based in Los Altos, is a private family foundation created in 1964 by David Packard and Lucile Salter Packard. The Packard Foundation awards grants to nonprofit organizations in several broad program areas, including science, population, conservation, and children, family, and community.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  This year Training & Development is looking at the needs of campus managers and administrative staff. Through this assessment, the unit is aiming to identify the skills needed by staff in these categories both in current and future positions.
</p>

<p>
  According to Training & Development manager Sharon Cohen Barry, once the skills are identified, the unit will determine which new programs should be developed, as well as which programs they will continue to offer.<br>
  <br>
  As part of this year's assessment, the unit, in conjunction with systemwide training managers, has put the Management Skills Assessment Program and the Professional Skills Assessment Program on a one-year hiatus while each program is evaluated.<br>
  <br>
  Training & Development will continue to offer programs in career development, supervisory development, performance management, communication and conflict resolution, and basic computer skills.

<p>
  Shorter days and falling leaves are sure signs that autumn is on its way, and one of the annual highlights of the season is the UCSC Harvest Festival, a family-oriented day of fun that will take place this year on Saturday, October 9, from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.
</p>The musical festivities begin at 11:30 a.m. when Dance Around Molly takes the stage to entertain with their authentic Irish tunes. They will be followed by Mariposa, a local folk group enjoyed by grown ups and kids alike, and then Later Alligator, playing lively Cajun music that's sure to have the crowd on its feet.
<p>
  Other highlights include crafts for the kids, workshops, tasty food, and tours of the UCSC Farm. (See <a href="schedule.html">detailed schedule</a>)
</p>
<p>
  Ongoing activities for children include crafts, face painting, pumpkin decorating, gardening activities, and hayrides. Delicious food will be for sale, and fresh-squeezed apple juice will be available for tasting. In addition, fresh organic produce, including pumpkins, will be available for purchase, as will dried-flower wreaths and UCSC Friends of the Farm & Garden merchandise, including aprons, coffee mugs, and T-shirts.
</p>
<p>
  As always, gardeners will have a field day with opportunities to soak up information about native plants, seed saving, garden-fresh cooking, and the benefits chickens and turkeys offer home gardens. Local community organizations will have booths set up, and a display of rare-breed chickens and turkeys is bound to be a crowd pleaser.
</p>
<p>
  Admission to the festival is $3; admission is free for children 12 and under and members of the Friends of the UCSC Farm & Garden, which is cosponsoring the event with the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems.
</p>
<p>
  The Farm is located 1/4 mile up the gravel road above the Blacksmith Shop; free public parking is available across the street from the Blacksmith Shop in the Physical Plant parking lot.
</p>
<p>
  For more information about the festival, call (831) 459-3248.

        <title>Lightning sparks wild fires on Big Creek Reserve</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_8951" align="alignright" width="200"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/1999/10/fire.99-10-04.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-8951" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/1999/10/fire.99-10-04.jpg" alt="One of a selection of photos on the Big Creek Reserve fire page, showing a "water drop"" width="200" height="150" /></a>One of a selection of photos on the Big Creek Reserve fire page, showing a "water drop"[/caption]
<p>
  A lightning storm that struck the Big Sur coast in early September sparked wildfires that continue to burn in rugged wilderness areas, including parts of UCSC's Landels-Hill Big Creek Reserve.<br>
</p><br>
Reserve manager John Smiley has posted a <a href="http://www.redshift.com/~jsmiley/fire.html">Big Creek Reserve fire page</a> on the Web, with photos and detailed descriptions of how the fire is affecting the reserve. As of Wednesday, September 29, Smiley reported that the fire-fighting crew were "pretty confident that they can save the structures, unless the wind strengthens."<br>
<br>
Maggie Fusari, director of UCSC's Natural Reserves, emphasized that fire is a natural part of the reserve's ecology and is not necessarily a bad thing. Reserve staff are first concerned with the health and safety of all the people at Big Sur and next are concerned about protecting the cabins and other structures located on the reserve.<br>
<br>
"The native vegetation is adapted to periodic fires, and most of the plants on the reserve either resprout after the burn or produce seeds that will either increase their germination or only germinate after a fire," Fusari said.<br>
<br>
The Hare Fire that is burning on the reserve is part of the larger Kirk Fire Complex, which has burned a total of 62,635 acres so far in the Ventana Wilderness of the Los Padres National Forest. These fires started as a result of a lightning storm that moved through the area on September 8. Detailed information about the Kirk Fire Complex is available on the Web at<br>
<a href="http://www.ventanawild.org/fire.html">http://www.ventanawild.org/fire.html</a><br>
<br>
The Landels-Hill Big Creek Reserve is part of UC's Natural Reserve System, the largest university-operated system of natural reserves in the world, with 33 reserves throughout the state. Big Creek is one of four reserves managed by the UCSC campus.

        <title>Anthropology brings major documentary film festival to Santa Cruz</title>

<p>
  If you loved the movie <i>Buena Vista Social Club,</i> mark your calendar for October 15, when local audiences will have a chance to enjoy the poignant film <i>Black Tears,</i> a musical portrait of the octogenarian Cuban quintet La Vieja Trova Santiaguera (The Old Troubadours).
</p>The 75-minute film by Dutch director Sonia Herman Dolz captures the group performing to sellout crowds during a six-month European tour and features moving interviews with the musicians as they reminisce about the music, dance, and love that has inspired them throughout the years. Beautifully shot, the film also documents one-of-a-kind musical moments.<br>
<br>
<i>Black Tears</i> will be screened as part of the first-ever Santa Cruz Margaret Mead Film & Video Festival, which will be held October 13-24 at Louden Nelson Community Center and at the Theater Arts Center at UCSC. The festival is being presented by the UCSC Anthropology Department, the Santa Cruz City Museum of Natural History, and the American Museum of Natural History.<br>
<br>
"This festival gives us the opportunity to see new international documentary films that otherwise wouldn't make it to campus or the community," said Hugh Raffles, assistant professor of anthropology and one of the organizers of the event.<br>
<br>
The festival offers 17 of the most outstanding entries from the prestigious Margaret Mead Film & Video Festival, which is presented annually in New York by the American Museum of Natural History.
<p>
  This year's inaugural Santa Cruz festival will include films from Taiwan, Cuba, Poland, Russia, Australia, Lithuania, Congo, Belgium, Canada, and the United States. The documentary films cover topics as diverse as taxidermy, abortion, menstruation, the transformation of traditional Aborigine dreaming stories into animated films, and the razing of a rural village in Taiwan to make way for a major highway.
</p>
<p>
  The schedule also includes the Santa Cruz premiere of <i>Pepino Mango Nance,</i> a film by UCSC graduate student Gillian Goslinga that tells the story of a young Chicano composer.<br>
  <br>
  The films are offered in six programs that revolve around the themes of relocation, border crossing, resistance, loneliness, women and taboo, and Australian indigenous media.<br>
  <br>
  The Margaret Mead Film & Video Festival in New York is the largest showcase for international documentaries in the United States. Founded in 1977, the festival honors pioneering anthropologist Margaret Mead, who was one of the first anthropologists to recognize the significance of film for fieldwork.
</p>
<p>
  Screenings during the first three days of the festival, October 13-15, will take place at the Louden Nelson Community Center at 301 Center Street in Santa Cruz. The second half of the festival, October 22-24, will take place in the Media Theater at the Theater Arts Center at UCSC.
</p>
<p>
  Tickets will be available in advance at the Civic Auditorium at 307 Church Street, the UCSC Ticket Office in the Theater Arts Center, and the Santa Cruz City Museum of Natural History at 1305 East Cliff Drive. Admission is $2.50. <font color="#AA0000">Please note:</font> The presenters advise discretion in bringing children under age 12 to the screenings.<br>
  <br>
  All shows start at 7 p.m. except for the matinee show on Sunday, October 24, which starts at 2 p.m.
</p>
<p>

        <title>Farmland preservation efforts to be discussed October 7</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  Throughout the state of California, farmland is being gobbled up to make way for new housing and commercial developments. In Pajaro Valley, farmland preservationists have actively opposed efforts to annex nearly 300 acres of prime farmland that the city of Watsonville is eager to convert to industrial uses.
</p>

<p>
  Come hear the latest news about farmland preservation efforts at a free public discussion on Thursday, October 7, from 7 to 8:30 p.m. The event, "Report from the Fields: Farmland Preservation Success Stories," is being cosponsored by the UCSC Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems and the Community Alliance with Family Farmers (CAFF). It will be held at the Patagonia store, 415 River Street, in Santa Cruz.
</p>

<p>
  Speakers will include Michael Ableman, the founder of the Center for Urban Agriculture at Fairview Gardens, which is based on one of the oldest organic farms in southern California.
</p>

<p>
  Ableman, who has farmed the land since 1981, has firsthand experience in farmland preservation, having successfully raised the funds to preserve Fairview Gardens under an active agricultural and educational conservation easement. The farm, which is surrounded by urban development, produces some 100 varieties of fruits and vegetables. A well-known writer, photographer, and educator, Ableman lectures around the world.
</p>

<p>
  Also addressing the gathering will be Reggie Knox, program coordinator for the Lighthouse Farm Network of CAFF, and Sam Earnshaw, Central Coast regional coordinator of CAFF.
</p>

<p>
  "We are part of a broad coalition of groups working together to develop a long-term strategy for the Pajaro Valley that addresses economic and social needs while protecting farmlands and wetlands," said Knox. "We are pleased to be collaborating with the city and with Watsonville residents to develop creative land-use policies that will help us build an economically viable and culturally vibrant community."

<p>
  The <a href="http://arts.ucsc.edu/sesnon">Sesnon Art Gallery</a> opens its 1999-2000 exhibition season with an exhibit of work by Pulitzer Prize-winning artist Art Spiegelman in the exhibit, "CRASH! Comix and graphics by Art Spiegelman."<br>
</p><br>
Spiegelman has redefined perceptions of comics as an artistic medium, challenging the distinction between high and low art by using comics in historical and theoretical contexts. Spiegelman is the cofounder and editor of <i>RAW</i> magazine, a cutting-edge anthology of cartooning and graphic experimentalism. He is perhaps best known for his Pulitzer Prize-winning books, <i>Maus I</i> and <i>Maus II,</i> in which he portrays the life of his father (in the form of a mouse) during the Holocaust, trying to survive the brutalities of the Nazis (portrayed as cats) first in his town and then in concentration camps.<br>
<br>
The exhibit highlights Spiegelman's current work, the exploration of comix journalism and comix autobiography, as well as earlier work. A range of media will be used, from CD ROMs to a display of original sketches.<br>
<br>
The exhibition continues through Sunday, November 21. A public reception will be held on Friday, October 8, from 4 to 6 p.m. in conjunction with an exhibition in the Porter Faculty Gallery, "My Mother Threw Mine Away," curated by Joe Ferraro from Atlantis Fantasyworld.<br>
<br>
The exhibition is also running in conjuntion with a public talk by Spiegelman, which launches <a href="http://events.ucsc.edu/artslecs/">Arts & Lectures'</a> 1900-2000 season. The talk, "Comix 101," takes place on October 7 at 8 p.m. in the Theater Arts Mainstage. For ticket information or to receive an Arts & Lectures' season brochure, call (831) 459-2159.<br>
<br>
Sesnon Gallery hours are Tuesday through Sunday, from noon to 5 p.m. For more information, call (831) 459-3606.

        <title>Professor shares a laugh with 'Doonesbury' cartoonist</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 04 Oct 1999 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>8945</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  It's a fair bet that nobody got as big a kick out of Garry Trudeau's recent "Doonesbury" strips as sociology's Dane Archer.
</p>

<p>
  The strips, which can be viewed on the Web at <a href="http://dke.org/doonesbury.html">dke.org/doonesbury.html</a>, called attention to a controversy that rocked the campus of Yale University in 1967, when an expose in the student newspaper revealed a particularly heinous hazing practice taking place at the local chapter of Delta Kappa Epsilon (DKE) fraternity. Under the leadership of George W. Bush Jr., who was president of the fraternity, members branded the backsides of initiates with hot irons, scarring pledges with small deltas, the fourth letter of the Greek alphabet.
</p>

<p>
  Archer, as coeditor of the <i>Yale Daily News'</i> weekly magazine at the time, ran a lengthy article about the practice with a front-page photo of an initiate's rear. ("Forgive me for that," he quips today. "I was young.") Trudeau, who was a Yale student at the time, reproduced the photo in his cartoon strip on September 21.
</p>

<p>
  For seven days, Trudeau featured his character Roland Hedley, "chief portal correspondent" for yap.com, pursuing the Texas governor to find out whether Bush had "suffered what he was dishing out."
</p>

<p>
  "I've often wondered if news of the branding would get out," said Archer, a professor of sociology. "Garry Trudeau and I are probably the only two people who remember where that photo originated. Trudeau was just getting started in cartooning, and we published some of his first strips in the paper. He was our cartoonist."
</p>

<p>
  After the paper published the results of its investigation, Archer recalls the university undertaking its own probe of the fraternity's practices and subsequently closing the fraternity. Yale University officials could only confirm that the fraternity is currently open.
</p>

<p>
  "Obviously, Garry Trudeau remembers the incident and thinks, as I do, that the whole thing, which took place in 1967, raises a question of character," Archer said of the presumptive Republican candidate for president, whose father was also a DKE member.

        <title>Arboretum holds fall plant sale with California Native Plant Society on Saturday, October 9</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 04 Oct 1999 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_8943" align="alignright" width="200"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/1999/10/telopea.99-10-04.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-8943" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/1999/10/telopea.99-10-04.jpg" alt="Telopea plants, which boast six-inch-wide crimson flowers, are the highlight of this year's Fall Plant Sale." width="200" height="133" /></a>Telopea plants, which boast six-inch-wide crimson flowers, are the highlight of this year's Fall Plant Sale.[/caption]
<p>
  The Arboretum is holding its annual Fall Plant Sale in conjunction with the California Native Plant Society on Saturday, October 9, from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. The sale will take place at the Arboretum Eucalyptus Grove, near the intersection of Western Drive and High Street.
</p><br>
The highlight of the sale will be the Telopeas, Australian plants with crimson flowers six inches wide, which the Arboretum will be selling for the first time in many years. These spectacular plants bear the scientific name <i>Telopea speciosissima,</i> which means "most showy, seen from afar." They are best grown in east-facing or northeast-facing areas or in areas with enough shade to keep the roots moderately cool. The plants become upright narrow shrubs, six to nine feet tall, that can be pruned severely once established.<br>
<br>
The Telopeas are very difficult to find in the United States. The <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/arboretum/">Arboretum</a> has propagated a large number for this year's sale, but there is a chance they will sell out during the members-only segment of the sale. From 10 to 11 a.m., the sale will be open only to members of the Arboretum and the California Native Plant Society (CNPS). You may join the Arboretum Associates on the day of the sale.<br>
<br>
The Arboretum is joining with CNPS for the fifth year to offer a wide selection of plants at this annual sale. In addition to the Telopeas, the Arboretum will have a good selection of the exotic Proteas for sale.<br>
<br>
For gardeners on the Central Coast, fall is an ideal time to plant California native plants or South African and Australian landscaping plants. The cooler months after the last heat wave of summer passes allow plants to establish good root systems before the next dry summer season. By establishing drought-tolerant plants from California, Australia, and South Africa now, gardeners can have plants that look good for years to come.<br>
<br>
The Arboretum specializes in plants not readily available in nurseries. Several of <i>Sunset</i> magazine's "best of the new plants" have been selections that were created or imported by the Arboretum staff. The Fall Plant Sale is an opportunity to buy plants now that may show up later on the "best of the new plants" lists. Local nurseries often donate additional plants to the sale.<br>
<br>
The Arboretum is open daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. The Arboretum gift shop, Norrie's Gifts, is open Tuesdays through Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., and Sundays, 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. The Jean and Bill Lane Horticultural Library is open Wednesdays through Sundays, 1 p.m. to 4 p.m.

        <title>Alumni Association welcomes 10,000th member</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 04 Oct 1999 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_8940" align="alignright" width="192"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/1999/10/slug.logo.99-10-04.gif"><img class="size-full wp-image-8940" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/1999/10/slug.logo.99-10-04.gif" alt="" width="192" height="170" /></a>[/caption]
<p>
  The <a href="http://alumni.ucsc.edu/">UCSC Alumni Association</a> welcomed its 10,000th member this week, marking the latest milestone for an organization that has supported the university since its first class graduated in 1968.
</p>
<p>
  The newest member is Melyssa Jo Kelly, a re-entry student who graduated from UCSC with a degree in women's studies in 1996.
</p>"I joined so I could stay in touch, and make it easy for faculty and my classmates to get in touch with me," said Kelly, administrator of the violence against women programs for the San Francisco Commission on the Status of Women.
<p>
  Rob Barandas, membership and marketing director for the association, said popular benefits of membership are the free library borrowing privileges at all UC campuses, the alumni locator service that helps graduates find their old friends, and discounts at campus recreation facilities.
</p>
<p>
  "But the main reason people join is to show support for the campus, not because of any tangible benefits," said Barandas. "It's nice to get the benefits, but they want to maintain their connections to the campus."
</p>
<p>
  Barandas, a 1991 graduate of UCSC, posts a monthly printout of the number of association members on his door, framed by a UCSC Alumni Association license plate holder. By enrolling 25 percent of the 40,000 graduates for whom it has addresses, the UCSC Alumni Association is doing very well for a campus of its size and age, said Barandas. About 47,000 students have graduated from UCSC. Among UC alumni associations, the UCSC organization trails only UC Berkeley and UCLA in the ratio of graduates to members, he noted.
</p>
<p>
  The association was established in 1968 to promote, influence, and support the educational, cultural, and social life of UCSC. Its members serve the university, its colleges, and students, and members help guide the university in the future. A 24-member Alumni Council is the governing body of the association. Membership fees help support campus programs, including undergraduate scholarships.
</p>
<p>
  Annual membership dues are $35; lifetime membership is available for a one-time payment of $450, or five payments of $100/year. All graduates are offered a free one-year membership in the association to introduce them to the organization. Next year, the association will publish a comprehensive <i>Year 2000 Alumni Directory</i> that will be available for members to purchase.

        <title>Y2K: Three months and counting</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_8938" align="alignright" width="148"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/1999/09/y2k_clock_99-09-27.gif"><img class="size-full wp-image-8938" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/1999/09/y2k_clock_99-09-27.gif" alt="" width="148" height="206" /></a>[/caption]
<p>
  In the wee hours of a Saturday morning about three months from today, as people around the world are ushering in the first day of 2000, a small corps of UCSC workers will spend the first few hours of the New Year on campus...looking for bugs.
</p>
<p>
  Not the multilegged variety, but for signs of the much discussed "Y2K (or Millennium) Bug."
</p>
<p>
  Pat LeCuyer, acting assistant vice chancellor for Communications and Technology Services (CATS), doesn't expect that the corps of staff members will uncover major power or system failures during their early-morning campus checkup on January 1. But with the winter quarter starting on Monday, January 3, no one wants to take any chances.
</p>
<p>
  "My concern is not so much that we will sustain failures to our mission-critical computer systems," LeCuyer said. "We feel like we're going to be in good shape in terms of the central systems like the Student Information System (SIS) and Financial Information System (FIS)."
</p>
<p>
  "My concern is that we will have so little time before our students return to campus for the winter quarter to get a Y2K-related failure fixed should we be surprised by one," he said.
</p>
<p>
  At UCSC and elsewhere, the primary Y2K exposure comes from the decades-old industry standard of using two instead of four digits for year representation within computer programs, files, databases, and logic boards. For example, the year 1999 is represented by "99." The worry, however, has been that on January 1, 2000, the computer-represented date of 01/01/00 might be interpreted as January 1, 1900, causing computer programs that perform arithmetic operations, comparisons, or sorting of date fields to yield incorrect results.
</p>
<p>
  To avoid such problems, UCSC staff has been identifying and mitigating Y2K risks for more than two years. CATS staff, for example, have checked hundreds of thousands of lines of computer code driving operating systems, applications, and files--and made necessary corrections.
</p>
<p>
  LeCuyer has also chaired a campuswide Y2K Task Force, which has worked with 24 Y2K coordinators from across the campus to assess the campus's overall Y2K readiness. The results of that assessment: "We've inventoried almost 900 central and department-level systems--everything from major systems like SIS and FIS that serve the entire campus to the smaller control systems that power fire alarms and elevators in specific buildings," LeCuyer said. "More than 98 percent of all of our central systems and 90 percent of all systems are already Y2K compliant. And we anticipate that all of the others will be compliant by the end of the calendar year."
</p>
<p>
  Just to be on the safe side, however, campus units that have identified life-support or mission-critical systems with any Y2K exposure have been asked to develop contingency plans that could be implemented on a moment's notice in the first days of January.
</p>
<p>
  Registrar Cecilia Rodriguez heads just such a unit. And while she is confident that SIS will be fully functional, enabling the campus to handle the volume of enrollment-related tasks that are completed at the beginning of each quarter, she's taking no chances. Rodriguez's staff is busy devising a process to handle those tasks the old-fashioned way: by paper.
</p>
<p>
  The Public Information Office, working with the Task Force, has established a Y2K Web site (<a href="http://y2k.ucsc.edu">y2k.ucsc.edu</a>) with links to Task Force documents and CATS' many Web pages on Y2K mitigation. The y2k.ucsc.edu Web page will provide current information on UCSC's Y2K status between now and the New Year--and in the critical hours, days, and weeks that follow.

        <title>Dinner, picnic bring levity to the fall quarter</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  Faculty and staff will enjoy good food and conversation with their colleagues at two events planned for late October. For faculty, a buffet-style "strolling dinner" is planned for Wednesday, October 27, at University House. The dinner will start immediately following the Academic Senate meeting that day, at approximately 5 p.m. Staff are invited to a picnic at the East Field on Friday, October 22, from 11:30-1:30 p.m. The picnic will feature a variety of foods, including deli-style sandwiches, salads, cakes, and cookies. Drawing on the tradition of staff barbecues from past years, participants will have access to the OPERS pool, lockers, and towels at no charge during the event. Staff will be provided release time to participate in the picnic, but campus offices normally open during the noon hour should remain open. Staff who wish to attend the picnic are requested to RSVP as soon as possible to Jeff Rockwell via e-mail at <a href="mailto:jrock@cats.ucsc.edu">jrock@cats.ucsc.edu</a>. Offices are encouraged to e-mail Rockwell with a "head count" for people they expect to attend. Staff are strongly advised to ride the campus shuttles to the barbecue, as construction taking place on campus is expected to limit the parking available in the East Field lot. In case of rain, the picnic will be moved to Cowell Dining Hall.

  <font color="#003399">EEO/AA Office launching campuswide exit interview program</font>
</h4>
<p>
  Over the past year, the number of career employees who have separated from UCSC has doubled from the previous year. To better understand the variables that affect staff employee retention, the EEO/AA Office is launching a campuswide exit interview program starting October 1. At the beginning of each month, the EEO/AA office will send an exit interview questionnaire to all career staff who have separated from the university during the previous month. The option for an in-person interview will be made available, with EEO/AA staff doing those interviews as requested.<br>
  <br>
  After one year of collecting this information, EEO/AA will issue a report with recommendations for action. The interviews will help to identify where improvements can be made to campus climate, management, and conditions of employment for staff. The interviews may help identify the campus's strengths as an employer as well. Units currently conducting exit interviews are encouraged to continue and to use the information to positively impact retention. For more information about the exit interview program, contact Lynda Tanaka at (831) 459-2686, tanaka@cats.ucsc.edu.

<p>
  Free software enabling users of the Linux operating system to monitor their hard drives and detect predictable drive failures is available from the School of Engineering's <a href="http://csl.cse.ucsc.edu/software/smart/">Concurrent Systems Laboratory</a>. Development of the software is sponsored by Quantum Corp. of Milpitas, Calif., a leading manufacturer of hard-disk drives.<br>
  <br>
</p>The failure of a hard drive is among the most frustrating experiences for computer users, and can be catastrophic if the drive's data have not been backed up. The S.M.A.R.T. (Self-Monitoring Analysis and Reporting Technology) system monitors hard drives and warns of impending failures before they happen. Originally developed by Compaq, S.M.A.R.T. technology has become an industry standard for hard drive manufacturers.<br>
<br>
"The S.M.A.R.T. system allows the computer to talk to the hard drive and ask how it's doing by measuring various performance parameters," said Darrell Long, associate professor of computer science in the Jack Baskin School of Engineering.<br>
<br>
The software for monitoring S.M.A.R.T.-capable hard drives has been available for Windows operating systems since 1995. Now, users of the increasingly popular Linux operating system can also take advantage of S.M.A.R.T. technology.<br>
<br>
Michael Cornwell, a software engineer at Quantum, developed S.M.A.R.T. for Linux as an independent study project at UCSC. Cornwell earned his B.A. degree in computer science from UCSC this year.<br>
<br>
"Quantum has been seeing a real interest in Linux from our customers," said Ted Deffenbaugh, director of strategic and technical marketing at Quantum. "With support for S.M.A.R.T., Linux users and the open source code movement will have even higher levels of data availability."<br>
<br>
The release of this software to the open source community is an important development, said Long, who was Cornwell's adviser on the project. The open source software movement, spearheaded by the Linux operating system, is based on making the source code for software programs freely available so that other software programmers can modify it and adapt it to their individual needs. Linux, initially created by Linus Torvalds, has been further developed through the efforts of many independent programmers working on the open source code. In contrast, companies such as Microsoft consider their software's source code a trade secret to be closely guarded.<br>
<br>
As Linux has become more popular, the demand for Linux-compatible software has increased. "There are an estimated 8 million Linux users now, and it is being used on everything from personal computers to large networks and Web servers," Cornwell said.<br>
<br>
The initial Phase I release of the S.M.A.R.T. for Linux software only supports ATA, one of two standard interfaces for connecting hard drives to computers. A complete software package that supports both ATA and SCSI will be released by the end of the year, Cornwell said.<br>
<br>
Quantum's sponsorship of the project was tremendously important because of the company's leading role in the implementation of the S.M.A.R.T. system for hard-disk drives, Cornwell said. "I gained a lot of valuable insight into different aspects of S.M.A.R.T. from talking to the developers at Quantum," he said.<br>
<br>
Through the S.M.A.R.T. system, Quantum disk drives incorporate a suite of advanced diagnostics that monitor the internal operations of a drive and provide an early warning for many types of potential problems. When a potential problem is detected, the drive can be repaired or replaced before any data are lost.<br>
<br>
The S.M.A.R.T. system consists of software that resides both on the disk drive and on the host computer. The software on the disk drive monitors the internal performance of the motors, media, heads, and electronics of the drive. The host software determines the overall reliability of the drive by analyzing the drive's internal performance parameters and comparing them to predetermined threshold limits.<br>
<br>
"Any user of a computer with a hard drive should be interested in knowing when the hard drive is about to fail," Cornwell said. "When something goes wrong, as happened to me on my laptop, the S.M.A.R.T system enables you to avoid a hard drive failure and repair the drive without losing any data."

<p>
  Researchers in the Center for the Molecular Biology of RNA have taken a huge step toward solving one of the most fundamental and daunting problems of molecular biology by obtaining images of the complete structure of the ribosome, a key component of all living things. Knowing the structure of the ribosome may lead to more effective antibiotics, new insights into the origins of life, and other significant advances.
</p><br>
Ribosomes are tiny molecular machines responsible for translating the genetic code and synthesizing proteins. They are the link between the genetic instructions encoded in DNA and the protein molecules that carry out the activities of living cells.<br>
<br>
The images obtained by the UCSC researchers show how different parts of the ribosome interact with one another and how the ribosome interacts with certain molecules involved in protein synthesis. Although researchers are eager to obtain even more detailed images of the ribosome in action, these results show that the ultimate goal of understanding exactly how the ribosome works is finally within reach.<br>
<br>
"What we have at present are a few snapshots, and ultimately what we would like is a movie of the ribosome in action," said Harry Noller, Sinsheimer Professor of Molecular Biology and head of the group that obtained the new images. Their findings are reported in two papers published in the September 24 issue of the journal <i>Science.</i><br>
<br>
The potential applications of this research cover a broad range, from understanding the origins of life to developing more effective antibiotics, Noller said. Ribosomes are ancient structures that show little variation among different forms of life. Inside every living cell, tens of thousands of ribosomes churn out proteins with mind-boggling speed and precision.<br>
<br>
Most research has focused on bacterial ribosomes, which are a bit smaller than those in higher organisms. Even bacterial ribosomes are extraordinarily complex. They are composed of three different RNA molecules and more than 50 different proteins arranged in two major subunits, which join together to form the complete ribosome.<br>
<br>
To obtain images of this complex structure, Noller's group used a technique called x-ray crystallography. This involved growing crystals of purified ribosomes, shining a focused beam of x-rays through the crystals, and analyzing the resulting diffraction pattern. The complete ribosome is the largest molecular structure ever solved by x-ray crystallography. (Some virus structures of comparable size have also been solved, but their symmetry allowed scientists to extrapolate from results obtained from a small portion of the whole structure.)<br>
<br>
Noller, who directs UCSC's Center for the Molecular Biology of RNA, has been studying the ribosome for the past 30 years. His coauthors include postdoctoral researchers Jamie Cate, now on the faculty of the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and Gloria Culver, now an assistant professor at Iowa State University; visiting researchers Marat Yusupov and Gulnara Yusupova; and Thomas Earnest, director of the crystallography facility at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, one of a handful of sites with a synchrotron capable of producing the high-energy x-rays needed for crystallography of a structure as large as the ribosome.<br>
<br>
In the first and longer of the two papers, the researchers present the structure of the complete ribosome with several of the molecules involved in protein synthesis bound to it. The crystals used to obtain this structure were prepared by the husband-and-wife team of Yusupov and Yusupova, who have been working on ribosome crystallization techniques for more than ten years. The crystallographic analysis, performed by Cate, yielded a medium-resolution structure, not detailed enough to show the location of every atom but sufficient to provide valuable insights into the ribosome's mechanism of action.<br>
<br>
Cate compared the ribosome to a miniature factory where proteins are made on an assembly line. "To a large extent it has been a mystery how this assembly line is laid out, and these papers show where different pieces of equipment are on the shop floor," he said.<br>
<br>
Biologists have known the basic outlines of protein synthesis for decades. The instructions for making a protein are carried to the ribosome by a messenger RNA molecule, which has copied the instructions from chromosomal DNA, the storehouse of genetic information carried in every cell. The building blocks of proteins are carried to the ribosome by transfer RNA molecules. On the ribosome, the transfer RNAs recognize specific sequences of genetic code on the messenger RNA, and the protein building blocks are then joined together in the proper order.<br>
<br>
There are three distinct binding sites for transfer RNAs on the ribosome, and the new images show how the transfer RNAs are positioned in each of those binding sites. During protein synthesis, the transfer RNAs pass sequentially through the three binding sites, which are located at the interface between the two subunits of the ribosome.<br>
<br>
"The transfer RNAs come through as if on a conveyor belt, and we can see how the ribosome holds the transfer RNA differently in each of the binding sites," Cate said.<br>
<br>
Another major finding is the recognition of what appears to be a molecular relay mechanism that may be part of a communication pathway between the large subunit and the small subunit. One of the elements of this pathway is a coil of RNA previously identified by other researchers as a molecular "switch" that can move between two different conformations.<br>
<br>
"The ribosome appears to be a dynamic molecular machine with moving parts and a very complicated mechanism of action," Noller said.<br>
<br>
The researchers presented additional details of the connections between the two subunits of the ribosome in the second paper. That paper describes a molecular bridge in which a loop of ribosomal RNA projects from the large subunit and interacts with a protein component of the smaller subunit.<br>
<br>
"Understanding how the subunits interact is critical to understanding how the ribosome works, and for the first time we've been able to identify the protein and RNA components of a bridge between the two subunits," said Culver, who performed a series of biochemical studies to characterize the components of the bridge.<br>
<br>
"The x-ray crystallography and the biochemical experiments complemented each other beautifully to provide these very clear results," Noller noted.<br>
<br>
The papers from Noller's lab follow close on the heels of reports published last month in the journal <i>Nature</i> by two other groups who used x-ray crystallography to study the structures of each of the two major subunits of the ribosome. Cate said he was struck by how little overlap there was between the findings reported by the three groups. Whereas the <i>Nature</i> papers focused on the architecture of the individual subunits, the UCSC researchers showed how the two subunits are joined and sought to interpret the images in terms of how the ribosome functions.<br>
<br>
"It shows just how wide open this field is that three groups can come up with completely different spotlights on the problem," Cate said.<br>
<br>
Noller said future research will proceed in two main directions. One goal is to solve the structure of the ribosome at higher and higher resolutions, eventually producing an atomic model of the entire complex. The other is to determine the structure of the ribosome in different stages of protein synthesis and with different molecules bound to it.<br>
<br>
According to Yusupov, x-ray crystallography of ribosomes in different functional complexes will provide many interesting results. Interactions with antibiotics, many of which work by binding to and disrupting bacterial ribosomes, are also a promising area of research, Yusupov said. "In the future we can identify antibiotic binding sites, and that may lead to new kinds of drugs," he said.

        <title>UCSC, city of Santa Cruz reach accord on parking structure</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  The parking-structure project planned for the Science Hill area of campus cleared a hurdle in September when campus and Santa Cruz officials signed an agreement that includes a promise from the city not to sue to stop construction.
</p>

<p>
  The campus, in return, agreed to contribute $250,000 toward the mutual development of a transportation master plan for Santa Cruz; the city is contributing the same amount. The campus also agreed not to pursue in the near future the idea of an eastern access route that would connect the campus to Highway 9.
</p>

<p>
  Speaking in the office of Assembly Speaker pro Tem Fred Keeley, who facilitated discussions between the two sides, Chancellor Greenwood said the agreement ushers in a "new era of cooperation between the university and the city."
</p>

<p>
  The parking structure is expected to be completed a year from now.

        <title>Nine students receive $20,000 scholarships</title>

        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  Nine talented students from regional community colleges have been awarded $20,000 scholarships to attend UCSC. Recipients receive $10,000 scholarships for each of two years, the support of a strong academic mentoring program, and assistance finding paid summer work experience in a field that complements their studies. Now in its seventh year, the scholarship program has helped dozens of community college transfer students realize their dream of a university education. "This program makes a tangible difference in the lives of students at our neighboring community colleges," said Chancellor Greenwood. "It puts a university education within the reach of students who would otherwise be unable to attend UCSC, and that's an accomplishment of which we are all very proud." The Karl S. Pister Leadership Opportunity Awards Program was established in 1993 by former UCSC Chancellor Karl S. Pister to increase opportunities for talented community college students who want to transfer to UCSC. The scholarships recognize students who have overcome adverse socioeconomic circumstances, who have a demonstrated commitment to assisting and improving the lives of others, and who might not otherwise be able to attend UCSC for financial reasons.
</p>

<p>
  Candidates are nominated by the presidents of each of 13 regional community colleges, and recipients are selected by Greenwood in consultation with the Leadership Opportunity Awards Program Screening Committee.<br>
  <br>
  A $5.2 million endowment has been established to fund the program permanently. Named scholarships honor contributors of major gifts to the program.<br>
  <br>
  A list of this year's recipients follows, with hometowns and college affiliations.<br>
  <br>
  For more information about the scholarship program or any of the recipients, call the UCSC Public Information Office at (831) 459-2495.

<p>
  <b>October 15 concert planned in celebration of Khan's appointment</b>
</p>
<p>
  Sarode master Ali Akbar Khan, considered to be one of the world's greatest living musicians, has been named Distinguished Adjunct Professor of Music at UCSC.
</p>A "national living treasure" of India, Khan is regarded as the most accomplished interpreter of Indian classical music alive today. Khan accepted his UCSC appointment this week. His first formal activity with UCSC will be a public concert in the campus's Music Center Recital Hall on Friday, October 15, at 8 p.m. (See below for details.)<br>
<br>
"We feel very privileged to have the opportunity of collaborating with such an extraordinary artist," said Edward Houghton, dean of the Arts Division. "Khansahib is not only an outstanding musician and dedicated teacher but also the heir and principal exemplar of a long and distinguished musical tradition. He will be a remarkable resource for our students and for our expanding programs in the arts and cultures of India."<br>
<br>
"This is a very unique collaboration between the university and my college," Khan said. "I'm very happy we will be working together. In my family, the knowledge and tradition of this music is very important and I want to be able to pass that on to future generations. My family learned this music originally in the 16th century at the time of Emperor Akbar. This is a wonderful thing that's going to happen with the university--this connection is an important way of keeping this music alive."<br>
<br>
Through the Ali Akbar College of Music in San Rafael and a branch in Switzerland, Khan has overseen the instruction of more than 15,000 students since 1967. Khan learned to value the teaching of music from his father, Acharya Allauddin Khan, one of India's greatest musicians and teachers.<br>
<br>
"My father taught me from the beginning how to learn, how to teach, and how to compose. I started learning with my father when I was only three and he continued to teach me every day for 15 hours a day for more than 20 years, up until he was 100 years old. From him I learned the importance of teaching others."<br>
<br>
Khan, 77, is a preeminent master of classical North Indian music. Khan is admired by both Eastern and Western audiences for his brilliant compositions and his mastery of the beautiful and complex 25-string sarode. His performances and recordings of Indian music are legendary, and today he is unquestionably one of the most respected and acclaimed Indian musicians in the world.
<p>
  Over the decades Khan has performed for more than 8 million people, recorded more than 95 albums, and received accolades across the globe. Some of his most recent honors include a National Heritage Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts, a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship, and five Grammy Award nominations.<br>
  <br>
  As distinguished adjunct professor, Khan will present occasional concerts, master classes, and workshops, both on his own and with associates. He will advise the Arts Division in the development of courses and resources in the classical music of India and facilitate a regular flow of outstanding visiting performers.<br>
  <br>
  The October 15 concert will feature Ustad (master) Ali Akbar Khan, Pandit Swapan Chaudhuri on the tabla, and Ustad Ali Akbar Khan's son, Alam, on the sarode.
</p>
<p>
  <font color="#AA0000">Tickets for the concert</font> are $30 for adults, $25 for seniors and students with identification, and $10 for UCSC students with identification.
</p>

        <title>Training & Development to assess needs of campus managers, administrative staff</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 27 Sep 1999 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  This year Training & Development is looking at the needs of campus managers and administrative staff. Through this assessment, the unit is aiming to identify the skills needed by staff in these categories both in current and future positions.
</p>

<p>
  According to Training & Development manager Sharon Cohen Barry, once the skills are identified, the unit will determine which new programs should be developed, as well as which programs they will continue to offer.<br>
  <br>
  As part of this year's assessment, the unit, in conjunction with systemwide training managers, has put the Management Skills Assessment Program and the Professional Skills Assessment Program on a one-year hiatus while each program is evaluated.<br>
  <br>
  Training & Development will continue to offer programs in career development, supervisory development, performance management, communication and conflict resolution, and basic computer skills.
</p>

<p>
  Other programs that will be offered through Training & Development this year include a Brown Bag Lunch Series on balancing work with the rest of one's life, and--pending funding approval--the second year of the pilot UCSC Management Development Program.
</p>

<p>

        <title>Construction continues in 1990-2000</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 27 Sep 1999 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>

        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  The following is an update on some of the major construction projects planned for the campus during the current academic year. The listing includes some of the expected impacts the projects may have on members of the campus community.<b><br>
  <br>
  Bay Tree Bookstore expansion and Graduate Commons:<br></b>Work will continue on exterior and interior walls, and mechanical, electrical, and plumbing systems will be installed for the 6,600-square-foot commons and 30,000-square-foot bookstore. The commons will offer office and recreational space for graduate students and space that will be occupied by the Whole Earth Restaurant. The new Bay Tree Bookstore building will feature an expanded selection of books, supplies, and services, and its third floor will feature office space for an expansion of Student Services, four conference rooms, and two outdoor decks. A pedestrian plaza is also planned. The projects, totaling $13.5 million, are expected to be completed during spring 2000. Hagar Drive, near the project, will remain one way, northbound, throughout construction. There will be occasional traffic delays due to construction vehicles. Construction noise in immediate area (Whole Earth Restaurant and Bookstore) will be experienced.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Interdisciplinary Sciences Building:<br></b>Construction is expected to start late this fall on the new Interdisciplinary Sciences Building, which will be built as an addition to the eastern end of Natural Sciences 2. The building will provide 34,137 assignable square feet of teaching, laboratory, research, office, and support space for the Environmental Studies, Astronomy, and Physics Departments. Construction on the $16.5 million project is expected to be completed by winter 2001. There will be traffic delays on the service road to the Science Library, Earth and Marine Sciences, and Natural Sciences 2. Pedestrian paths will be rerouted along the construction site. Temporary parking impacts will be experienced.<br>
  <br>
  <b>OPERS Fitness Center:<br></b>Interior finishing work, landscaping, and road resurfacing continues for the new 10,600-square-foot weight-training and fitness center for the Office of Physical Education, Recreation, and Sports. Construction on the $4 million facility is expected to be completed and exercise equipment installed in late fall.<br>
  <br>
  <b>College Nine Apartments:<br></b>Construction is continuing on the College Nine Apartments, located north of the existing Colleges Nine and Ten academic buildings. The $20.76 million project will provide housing for 280 undergraduate students. Traffic delays at access road to Social Sciences 1 and 2 due to construction deliveries. Construction-related noise expected.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Core West Parking Structure:<br></b>Preliminary site work has been done. Bids were received August 24, and completion of construction is scheduled for October 2000. Short-term construction impacts include loss of 66 parking spaces in Lot #112 and up to 16 parking spaces in Lot #113 that will be used for construction staging. Temporary noise impacts during construction could be experienced at nearby science buildings (Natural Sciences 2, Baskin Engineering, and Sinsheimer Labs) and at the Graduate Student Apartments. Noise mitigation measures such as restricted hours of operation will be required to minimize noise impacts. Some pedestrian circulation could be subject to temporary adjustments to accommodate construction. Project includes improved and/or new pedestrian, bicycle, and transit facilities.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Center for Ocean Health:<br></b>Construction of the site work portion of this Long Marine Laboratory project is expected to start this fall. The building will consist of office and laboratory space for the Institute of Marine Sciences and other campus units involved in marine research. The project is partially funded by a gift from the Packard Foundation. Several of the existing modular office units will be removed to make way for the construction. Construction traffic should be expected in the vicinity of the existing facilities and the Long Marine Lab access road.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Long Marine Lab infrastructure improvements:<br></b>A project to extend sewer and natural gas underground piping to the Long Marine Lab is expected to begin in the fall and be completed by approximately January 2000. Traffic delays will occur along the length of the access road to the Long Marine Lab as work progresses. The road will remain open to traffic throughout construction.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Improvements to Arts Facilities:<br></b>Construction completed.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Seymour Marine Discovery Center:<br></b>Construction completed.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Road resurfacing and repair projects:<br></b>Physical Plant will construct retaining walls and repair and resurface several campus roads this fall. These include McLaughlin Drive, from the bridge east of Science Hill to Heller Drive; Steinhart Way, from the McLaughlin intersection to the bookstore parking lot; and Heller Drive, from the College Eight entrance to near the McLaughlin Drive intersection. The work is scheduled to begin September 27 and end November 19. During the road repair projects there will be one-way traffic at the various work locations on Heller, Steinhart, and McLaughlin. There will be flagperson traffic control at these locations and delays up to 3 minutes should be expected to allow traffic to pass from the opposite direction.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Roof-repair projects, renovations:<br></b>Physical Plant plans roof work for Hahn Student Services (8/19/99-10/18/99), the Communications Building (9/27/99-10/19/99), the Central Garage (9/30/99-11/14/99), and the East Field House dance studio and activity building (10/4/99-12/4/99). In addition, crews will renovate restrooms in the Crown College academic building and replace windows in Porter College Building D. For more information about the Physical Plant projects listed above (road and roof projects), call Henry Salameh at (831) 459-3365 or send e-mail to <a href="mailto:salamehh@cats.ucsc.edu">salamehh@cats.ucsc.edu</a>.

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  The Science Matters Book Club, which meets each month at the Central Branch of the Santa Cruz Public Library, holds its meeting for next month on Sunday, October 17, from 2 to 4 p.m. Mike Dalbey, a lecturer in biology at UCSC, will lead a discussion of Jared Diamond's Pulitzer Prize-winning book <i>Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies.</i><br>
  <br>
  The book club is open to the general public and focuses on nontechnical science books. Each discussion is led by a member of the local scientific community with expertise in the subject of that month's book. Meetings are usually on the third Sunday of each month.<br>
  <br>
  The book club is sponsored by the Santa Cruz Public Libraries, the UCSC Science Library, the Cabrillo College Library, the Association for Women in Science-Monterey Bay, the Capitola Book Cafe, and the Santa Cruz City Museum of Natural History. The Capitola Book Cafe offers a 10 percent discount to members of the book club for the monthly selections.<br>
  <br>
  "This book club was created to provide a forum for readers of lay science books to be able to ask questions of professionals in the field," said Victoria Welborn, reference librarian at the UCSC Science Library. "It also provides a forum for scientists to discuss their work with nonscientists."<br>
  <br>
  For more information about the Science Matters Book Club, contact Victoria Welborn at (831) 459-2816 or <a href="mailto:welborn@cats.ucsc.edu">welborn@cats.ucsc.edu</a>. Information is also available on the Web at <a href="http://www.santacruzpl.org/science">www.santacruzpl.org/science</a>.

<p>
  Beat the traffic blues and the high price of gasoline by riding your bicycle to campus on Thursday, October 7, the first-ever Bike to Work/School Day to be held in the fall in Santa Cruz County.<br>
</p><br>
Bike to Work/School Day has been an annual event in the spring since 1988. The new Bike to Work/School Day takes place during the annual California Rideshare Week, October 4-8. Organizers are expecting both events to continue annually.<br>
<br>
As during the spring event, cyclists can enjoy a free breakfast from 6:30 to 9:30 a.m. on October 7 at sites throughout the county. One of the sites is located at the UCSC Student Center at The Bike Co-op, where Beckmann's muffins, Noah's Bagels, Martinelli juice, Jamba Juice, and Peet's coffee will be on the menu.<br>
<br>
The sites also feature free bike fixes, commuter massages, and the opportunity for cyclists to win one of three prizes: a trip around the world, a Patagonia all-weather cycling jacket, or a $50 gift certificate from Bugaboo Mountain Sports.<br>
<br>
In addition to UCSC, other breakfast locations include: the Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium, The Buttery, and Java Junction at the Gateway Shopping Plaza in Santa Cruz; Simpkins Family Swim Center in Live Oak; Cabrillo College in Aptos; Le Boulanger in Scotts Valley; and Nook Cafe in Watsonville. New Leaf Community Markets in Capitola, Felton, and Westside Santa Cruz also offer breakfast locations (in Santa Cruz the site is also sponsored by Beckmann's Bakery).<br>
<br>
Bike to Work is sponsored by The Spokesman Bicycles, Monterey Bay Unified Air Pollution Control District, Santa Cruz County Regional Transportation Commission, and many other businesses and organizations in Santa Cruz County, including UCSC's Transportation and Parking Services.<br>
<br>

        <title>Replacing SIS</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 27 Sep 1999 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
  <b>Project planners soliciting faculty comment on new Academic Information System</b>
</p>

<p>
  When four UCSC offices purchased the Student Information System (SIS) almost 15 years ago, the relationship between computers in general and their users was often tenuous. Computers back then were slow, the training required to use the more complicated programs was extensive, and the results were predictable: frustrated users all too often decided the effort wasn't worth the trouble.
</p>

<p>
  One of the campus's primary database systems, SIS, was a product of those times: Its overly complicated menus and screens provided only users-in-the-know with direct access to important information about students and their academic records.
</p>

<p>
  "SIS has been very successful for what it was designed to do," said Mark Cianca, director of communications and systems development for Student Affairs. "But it was purchased a year before relational databases became available. The reality is, unless you have an absolute need to use SIS, you don't use it."
</p>

<p>
  Today, people on campus expect, want, and many times need immediate access to information. As the campus has grown, for example, it has become more important than ever for faculty and academic support staff to know precisely how many students are enrolled in courses during those critical early days and weeks of each quarter. And students, who have grown up on computers, expect to be able to go online to get everything from their course schedule to important financial aid information.
</p>

<p>
  That's why Student Affairs is spearheading a campuswide effort to replace SIS with a state-of-the-art and newly named Academic Information System (AIS). With the support of Executive Vice Chancellor John Simpson, who allocated $500,000 in one-time and $100,000 in ongoing funds to support the project during this year's budget process, Cianca is leading a group that is designing SIS's replacement.
</p>

<p>
  "As project sponsors, we intend to identify a new Academic Information System to serve the entire campus enterprise," said Francisco Hernandez, vice chancellor for Student Affairs.
</p>

<p>
  The 26-person faculty and staff project team, working with Marketect, an outside firm, this past summer, already has prepared a survey and assessed nearly 100 users about the functions they would like to see in the new AIS.
</p>

<p>
  This fall, the project team will expand that outreach to include many more faculty users. "We will engage faculty in focus groups, department meetings, and one on one," Cianca said. "We will be asking them: 'What do you want the new system to do for you?'"
</p>

<p>
  That feedback will be included in the Request for Proposals, expected to be distributed to prospective vendors during the winter quarter.
</p>

<p>
  Cianca's team, meanwhile, is monitoring the commercial world in an effort to ensure that the new system spans the desires of the users and the realm of the doable. "We don't want to 'blue sky' our new system in a vacuum," Cianca said. "We need to specify what features we want the new system to have <i>and</i> make sure that it's something that vendors really can provide us."
</p>

<p>
  According to the project schedule, the new AIS would be online in the 2003 academic year.
</p>

        <title>Music Department makes sound investment</title>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_8913" align="alignright" width="200"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/1999/09/piano.99-09-20.200.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-8913" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/1999/09/piano.99-09-20.200.jpg" alt="Anatole Leikin and Maria Ezerova tinkle the keys of the Music Department's new Steinway pianos.

<p>
  If the three piano faculty in the Music Department seem a little more upbeat than usual these days, it might have something to do with the recent arrival of two beautiful Steinway concert pianos, now ensconced in the Recital Hall.
</p><br>
The Steinway Model D concert grands arrived on campus August 31 after a long process that involving research, fund-raising, and even an expedition to New York by piano faculty. But, according to Music Operations Manager Tom Listmann, the work has been well worth the results.<br>
<br>
"We've purchased two world-class pianos to go with our top-class Recital Hall," he said, noting that the pianos, valued at some $80,000 each, are among the most expensive musical instruments the department owns.<br>
<br>
Before the Steinways arrived, UCSC pianists struggled with three pianos far older than most of the students who played on them--a Steinway and two Bosendorfers.
<p>
  "The pianos that were in the hall before were not adequate," said Mary Jane Cope. A lecturer in music at UCSC, Cope is one of three music faculty members who teaches piano. Cope and her colleagues, associate music professor Anatole Leikin and lecturer Maria Ezerova, are reveling in the rich sounds of the new pianos.<br>
  <br>
  "Before, it was a matter of making due with what we had," Cope says. "But with this extraordinary hall we need the instruments that go with it. Those pianos were serviceable but never sounded very good. We've even had visiting pianists refuse to play on them in the past."<br>
  <br>
  But, because of their cost, obtaining the pianos was not just a matter of logistics. Ultimately, the Music Department was able to purchase the pianos thanks to a substantial gift from Santa Cruz County residents Mary and Richard Solari.<br>
  <br>
  Once the funds were available, Leikin and Ezerova traveled to the Steinway factory in New York to select the pianos. "Every piano is different," Listmann explains. "They all have different action, a different feel, a different tone. And a Steinway D is the premiere concert piano in the world. Because it's such a significant investment, you want someone who knows what they're doing to go and pick them out." Along with other considerations, Leikin and Ezerova made sure to select pianos with compatible sounds.<br>
  <br>
  "This is a really sound investment," Cope notes. "These instruments, with proper care, are going to last us a long time."<br>

        <title>Gary Griggs to head newly formed UC Marine Council</title>

<p>
  The University of California has established a Marine Council to help coordinate marine research on the 10 UC campuses and provide information on ocean-related issues, university President Richard C. Atkinson announced last week.<br>
  <br>
  Gary Griggs, professor of earth sciences and director of UCSC's Institute of Marine Sciences, will serve as the council chairman.<br>
</p><br>
The new systemwide organization will facilitate research, education, and public service programs among the UC campuses, as well as programs involving private marine-related industries, private colleges, and marine-related not-for-profit organizations.<br>
<br>
The Marine Council will also provide advice to local, regional, and state governmental agencies pertaining to California's ocean-related issues and concerns. One of the new organization's first assignments, at the request of Sen. Dede Alpert (D-San Diego), will be to appoint a committee of UC scientists to review the scientific information on a proposal to study decommissioning alternatives for offshore oil and gas facilities.<br>
<br>
"The University of California has marine research and education capabilities that are unparalleled in the world," said Atkinson. "The University of California Marine Council will help bring those resources to the service of local, state, and federal agencies, as well as to other public and private entities."<br>
<br>
California's l,000-mile coastline plays an important role in the state's economy. The state's six major ports have a combined economic impact of $3.4 billion annually, and a 1994 study concluded that seven ocean-dependent industries (fishing, mariculture, kelp and sea vegetable harvesting, offshore oil and natural gas production, mineral production, port activities, and coastal tourism and recreation) annually contributed $17 billion to the state's economy.<br>
<br>
"California is a coastal-dependent state, yet the economic value of its marine resources is often underappreciated," Griggs said.<br>
<br>
In California, as in other coastal states, human activities have led to significant modifications of the coastal zone's ecological systems, seriously impacting their ability to sustain themselves, Griggs noted.<br>
<br>
For example, nearshore waters receive wastewater from domestic, industrial, and agricultural drainage. Contaminated sediments have increasingly begun to restrict dredging of major ports, through which 95 percent of the state's foreign trade must pass. Furthermore, many of the state's fisheries have collapsed, and species that were once economically valuable are now endangered.<br>
<br>
"California's ocean issues must be addressed in ways that not only contribute to scientific understanding of natural processes and human-induced changes, but also are useful to the legislators, policy makers, and managers who must make decisions affecting the long-term health of the ocean," Griggs said.

        <title>Violent collisions between galaxies fuel star formation, according to new study</title>

<p>
  When the universe was about one-tenth of its current age, more than 10 billion years ago, the precursors of massive galaxies such as our own Milky Way were being built from smaller galaxies that collided and merged, triggering violent bursts of star formation. This scenario, one of two competing views of young galaxies proposed by cosmologists, is supported by a recent analysis of supercomputer data led by UCSC researchers.<br>
</p><br>
The new study sheds light on the nature of the most distant galaxies observed by modern telescopes. These galaxies, called "high-redshift galaxies" because their light has been strongly shifted toward longer (redder) wavelengths by the expansion of the universe, have presented a challenge to cosmologists since they were first detected in the early 1990s.<br>
<br>
The high-redshift galaxies are very faint because of their great distance from the earth, but astronomers have analyzed the light from them and determined that they actually shine very brightly and are dominated by young, hot stars. They are also small compared to similarly bright galaxies in the nearby universe. These observations indicate a very high rate of star formation, and the challenge is to explain how these young galaxies accumulated enough mass to burn so brightly.<br>
<br>
"The mystery is that these very luminous galaxies are so far away that the light we see today left them when the universe was only 10 to 15 percent of its current age, and one wonders how so many bright galaxies had already formed so early in the evolution of the universe," said Tsafrir Kolatt, a postdoctoral researcher and lead author of a paper describing the new findings.<br>
<br>
In the paper, which has been posted on the <a href="http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/ApJ/journal/issues/ApJL/v523n2/995412/995412.html">Internet</a> and will be published in the October 1 issue of <i>Astrophysical Journal Letters,</i> Kolatt and his coauthors explain the observed properties of these distant galaxies in terms of the formation and evolution of structure in the early universe. Their results suggest that the high-redshift galaxies offer a glimpse of the universe at a stage when the large-scale structure of the cosmos was still forming.<br>
<br>
Coauthors Joel Primack, professor of physics, and Sandra Faber, University Professor of astronomy and astrophysics, have been collaborating since the 1980s on efforts to understand the formation of galaxies, clusters of galaxies, and other large-scale structures in the universe. The other coauthors include James Bullock and Patrik Jonsson at UCSC; Rachel Sommerville, Yair Sigad, and Avishai Dekel at Hebrew University in Jerusalem; and Andrey Kravtsov and Anatoly Klypin at New Mexico State University (NMSU).<br>
<br>
The paper, entitled "Young galaxies: What turns them on?," evaluates two competing scenarios that have been proposed to explain the origins of high-redshift galaxies. Both scenarios incorporate the standard features of modern cosmology, including a universe dominated by dark matter, mysterious particles that make up at least 90 percent of the mass of the universe. In this standard model of the cosmos, galaxies form within large halos of dark matter.<br>
<br>
According to one explanation of high-redshift galaxies, they sit in the middle of very massive dark-matter halos. The gravitational pull of the dark matter feeds gas into the center, where it condenses into stars. Kolatt calls this the "central quiescent" scenario, because it describes a steady rate of star formation proceeding over an extended period of time. For this scenario to work, however, the galaxy must have a huge supply of gas to maintain a high rate of star formation.<br>
<br>
The alternative view, championed by Primack and his collaborators, is the "collisional starburst" scenario, in which collisions between small galaxies trigger intense but relatively short-lived bursts of star formation. When two galaxies collide, clouds of gas get funneled toward the center of the larger galaxy, and the gas condenses to form new stars. Through this mechanism, relatively small galaxies can generate very high rates of star formation.<br>
<br>
To test these two scenarios, the researchers used supercomputers to simulate the behavior of matter over billions of years in a representative chunk of the universe. The results of the simulation provided strong support for the collisional starburst scenario.<br>
<br>
Cosmologists rely heavily on such supercomputer simulations to test their theories of how the universe evolved. These simulations track the interactions of millions of particles of matter, starting with the initial conditions shortly after the Big Bang and proceeding according to the standard laws of physics and the latest theories regarding the nature of dark matter and other critical factors. Each simulation generates a representation of the universe that can be compared with current observations.<br>
<br>
The simulation used in this study, developed by Kravtsov and Klypin at NMSU, provided an unprecedented level of resolution, enabling the researchers to analyze the interactions of relatively small clumps of matter and to detect collisions and mergers. Supercomputers were needed not only for the simulation itself but also for the analysis of the output from the simulation. The researchers used computers at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington, D.C., and the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the University of Illinois.<br>
<br>
"This project is right at the edge of what's possible with the biggest, fastest computers available," Primack said.<br>
<br>
Both the simulation and its analysis, led by Kolatt and Bullock, were innovative, Primack added. "The simulation provided such high resolution that it was possible to find every lump of dark matter in the simulation volume and to tell whether one dark matter halo merged with another; nobody has ever done this before halo by halo, looking at every particle in every halo," he said.<br>
<br>
The researchers then used data from earlier simulations, performed at UCSC, that showed what happens when two galaxies collide. Those results enabled them to calculate the star formation rates that would result from the mergers of dark matter halos and their associated galaxies. "For each individual collision in the simulation, we had to calculate how many stars would form, how long they would shine, and what colors would be observed in the light from them," Kolatt said.<br>
<br>
The results showed that the observed properties of the high-redshift galaxies are best explained by the collisional starburst scenario. "The simulation gave us the right numbers [of high-redshift galaxies], the right clustering properties, and the right brightnesses to explain what we actually see with the telescopes," Bullock said.<br>
<br>
Most of the collisions in the simulation occurred in or near relatively massive dark matter halos, resulting in strong clustering of the starbursts in space. "We believe that what we're seeing in these high-redshift galaxies is the build-up of structure in the universe, and that this process generates stars with high efficiency," Bullock said.<br>
<br>
The central quiescent scenario did not fare so well, because the simulation did not generate enough galaxies of sufficient mass to account for the evolution of the number of high-redshift galaxies observed, Kolatt said.<br>
<br>
In addition to presenting results that match current observations, the authors make predictions that can be tested by further observations of high-redshift galaxies. A key test that can differentiate between the two scenarios is how the number of galaxies changes with increasing distance. At higher and higher redshifts, the number of galaxies observed should fall off much faster for the central quiescent model than for collisional starbursts. Another important test will be precise measurements of the masses of high-redshift galaxies, which Faber hopes to obtain within the next year.<br>
<br>
"We suspect that we will find the galaxies are small, and that will confirm that these objects are bright but low mass, meaning they must be undergoing a starburst," Faber said.

<p>
  <b>First day of instruction is Thursday, September 23</b>
</p>
<p>
  The first day of classes in the 1999-2000 school year at UC Santa Cruz is Thursday, September 23. Students, however, began moving into on-campus
</p>housing at UCSC on Thursday, September 16; the official "move-in" days were scheduled to be completed on Saturday, September 18.
<p>
  The following information has been compiled about the 1999-2000 year at UCSC:
</p>
<p>
  <b>ENROLLMENT:</b>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>UCSC is expecting an opening-day enrollment of approximately 11,400 students, 419 more students than were officially enrolled last fall (10,981). Enrollment totals become official following the third week of instruction.
  </li>
  <li>Of the 11,400 students, approximately 10,335 are expected to be undergraduates; 1,065 are expected to enroll in graduate studies.
  </li>
  <li>Of the undergraduates expected to enroll, approximately 3,350 will be new students (freshmen and transfer students). The total number of new students this year is 82 more than the total number of new students who enrolled last fall (3,268).
  </li>
  <li>These 3,350 new undergraduates were admitted from among 18,475 applicants for undergraduate admission.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <b>PROFILE OF NEW FRESHMEN:</b>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Approximately 2,450 of the 3,350 new undergraduates expected will be freshmen.
  </li>
  <li>Of the total number of freshmen expected, 805 identified themselves as African American, Chicano, Latino, American Indian, Asian/Asian American, or Filipino/Filipino American. A three-year summary prepared by the UC Office of the President indicates that the ethnic profile of incoming freshmen at UCSC has become increasingly diverse since 1997, when 708 students identified themselves as belonging to one of the six groups mentioned above. (Fall 1997 was the first quarter in which the University of California was prohibited from considering ethnicity in admissions decisions.)
  </li>
  <li>The two most popular majors among freshmen who have already declared are biology (186) and psychology (181). The Jack Baskin School of Engineering, beginning its third fall, attracted 212 freshmen who declared in the following majors: computer science (130), computer engineering (60), electrical engineering (15), and information systems management (7).
  </li>
  <li>Nearly one-half (47.9 percent) of the expected freshmen come from two regions of the state: the San Francisco Bay Area (31.0 percent) and the Monterey Bay-Silicon Valley (16.9 percent). More than a quarter (26.2 percent) come from the Los Angeles-South Coast region of the state.
  </li>
  <li>Among the freshmen expected to enroll at UCSC this fall are 46 Regents Scholars. Among the most academically accomplished high school graduates, these students will receive UC's most prestigious scholarship, which covers all university fees for four years. The number of Regents Scholars who have accepted UCSC's offer to enroll has nearly tripled since 1995, when 16 students enrolled. This year's Regents Scholars have an average grade-point average of 4.2 and average SAT scores of 1428. (Three other new students, transferring to UCSC this fall, qualified for the same scholarship; among new and continuing students, UCSC's student body now includes 176 Regents Scholars.)
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <b>HOUSING UCSC STUDENTS:</b>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>To help offset a shortage of rental housing in the surrounding community, UCSC has increased its housing capacity by 943 bed spaces over the past three years--from 4,088 in fall 1996 to 5,031 this fall. (That total does not include accommodations for some 250 students who will live in Family Student Housing and 50 who will reside in the campus's RV Park.)
  </li>
  <li>Of the 943 bed spaces created in the past three years, 224 were added for this academic year, including spaces for 100 students who will live in a block of 53 rooms UCSC has leased from the Holiday Inn on Ocean Street and for 94 students who are expected to occupy 54 new apartments in the University Town Center on Pacific Avenue. (An additional 12 bed spaces in the center will be occupied by English Language International Program students affiliated with UCSC Extension.)
  </li>
  <li>In all, the campus will be housing 47 percent of its student body in university-sponsored housing, the highest percentage of any UC campus. (San Diego, next highest, houses 35 percent of its students.)
  </li>
  <li>In addition to students who will reside in university-sponsored housing, 234 UCSC students are making plans to reside in rooms provided by 21 local motels participating in the Slug Housing Partnership Program. In its third year, this program links students with local motels, which rent rooms to students on a monthly basis during the academic year (when there is less tourist demand for rooms).
  </li>
  <li>Later in the 1999-2000 academic year, 280 additional on-campus bed spaces (a net increase of 109) will open for students upon the completion of the College Nine Apartments. That project will replace the temporary housing for 171 undergraduates provided nearby in UCSC's Village. (The campus plans to reopen the Village elsewhere on campus next fall.)
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <b>NEW PROGRAMS FOR UCSC STUDENTS:</b>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Jack Baskin School of Engineering is launching the Department of Electrical Engineering this fall. The first class of undergraduates majoring in electrical engineering will be starting their junior year this fall.
  </li>
  <li>The campus has also launched new undergraduate pathways in environmental biology (biology major), environmental chemistry (chemistry/biochemistry major), environmental geology and ocean sciences (earth sciences major), and electronic music (music major).
  </li>
  <li>This is the first quarter in which UCSC can begin conferring degrees in its newly approved M.A. program in environmental studies. The new degree--awarded enroute to the Ph.D.-- joins environmental studies' bachelor's degree and Ph.D. offerings.
  </li>
  <li>Two new Ph.D. programs--in environmental toxicology and politics--have also been approved for fall 1999.
  </li>
  <li>UCSC's Film and Video Department, offering one of the campus's fastest growing majors, has been renamed the Film and Digital Media Department to reflect the changing nature of the field.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <b>ECONOMIC IMPACT:</b>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The largest employer in Santa Cruz County, UCSC brings in a substantial amount of money from outside county borders, most of which is spent in the county. During the 1997-98 year, UCSC was responsible for two-thirds of a billion dollars of economic activity in Santa Cruz County through spending by its faculty, staff, students, out-of-town visitors, and the university itself. (The 1997-98 totals are the most current figures available.)
  </li>
  <li>Actual spending by the university and its employees, students, and visitors totaled $297.3 million; when calculated by an economic multiplier formula, the total jumps to $666.0 million. (The economic multiplier is a calculation used by economists to measure not just the actual dollars spent, but the value of those dollars when they are spent again. In essence, the economic multiplier shows the ripple effect of each dollar spent in an economy.)
  </li>
</ul>

        <title>History professor appointed to National Endowment for the Humanities</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 20 Sep 1999 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>8905</wp:post_id>

        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_8904" align="alignright" width="180"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/1999/09/castillo_pedro.99-09-20.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-8904" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/1999/09/castillo_pedro.99-09-20.jpg" alt="Pedro Castillo" width="180" height="252" /></a>Pedro Castillo[/caption]
<p>
  A UCSC historian is one of five people to be named by President Clinton to serve on the 26-member board of the National Endowment for the Humanities. Pedro Castillo, an associate professor of history, was named as one of five new members to serve on the National Council on the Humanities, the advisory board of the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH). The nominees were identified in an announcement released by the White House on September 8. Their appointments will be made official following Senate approval.
</p><br>
The National Council on the Humanities advises NEH Chairman William Ferris on policies and programs and grant allocations. Members serve six-year terms.<br>
<br>
Castillo is well prepared for the new duties he will take on, having served as a member of the California Council for the Humanities, an NEH-affiliated program, since last January. Among his priorities as an NEH council member will be to support research in nontraditional subject areas examining such issues as race, class, and gender.<br>
<br>
"In the last few decades, studies in the humanities have broadened out from the traditional Western canon. I want to encourage these inclusive perspectives that emphasize the significance of the histories and cultures of marginalized gender, ethnic, and class groups," he said.<br>
<br>
Castillo is co-founder and a former director of UCSC's Chicano/Latino Research Center. His teaching and research focus on the history and politics of Mexican Americans in the U.S. His most recent book is <i>The American Nation</i> (Prentice-Hall, 1998), a textbook on American history that has been adopted by a number of school districts for their junior high school curricula. Along with his academic work, Castillo is extensively involved in the local community.<br>
<br>
"I feel very strongly that faculty should relate their work at the university to the community," he said. Castillo serves on the board of trustees of the Community Foundation of Santa Cruz County; on the board of the Pajaro Valley Health Trust; and as chair of the planning commission for the city of Watsonville. He served as a Clinton delegate in the 1992 and 1996 Democratic National Conventions and is considering serving as a delegate again for the 2000 convention.<br>
<br>
The approval process leading to the White House announcement of Castillo's nomination involved an FBI background check and took a year and a half from the time he was invited to submit his name until the announcement. The process will not be completely finalized until the Senate approves the Clinton appointees. But, Castillo said placidly, "Some people have told me that this is moving relatively fast."<br>
<br>
The NEH is a federal agency with an annual budget of more than $110 million. Funds are used to support research, education, museum exhibitions, documentaries, preservation, and other activities in the humanities.<br>
<br>
The other four Clinton appointees are Linda Lee Aaker, an attorney for an Austin, Texas, law firm; Edward Ayers, a history professor at the University of Virginia; Peggy Prenshaw, a faculty member in the Louisiana State University's Department of English; and Theodore Striggles, an arts and intellectual property lawyer in New York.

        <title>Faculty, staff invited to test-drive the 'car of the future'</title>
        <pubDate>Mon, 20 Sep 1999 00:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
        <wp:post_id>8903</wp:post_id>
        <description></description> 
        <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>[caption id="attachment_8902" align="alignright" width="200"]<a href="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/1999/09/car.99-09-20.jpg"><img class="size-full wp-image-8902" src="http://dev-ucsc-news.pantheonsite.io/wp-content/uploads/1999/09/car.99-09-20.jpg" alt="Wes Scott poses beside the EV1 that is on loan to UCSC for the next few weeks.

<p>
  What do you call a car with no engine, gas tank, or tailpipe? An EV1 (electric vehicle 1)--and you can test-drive one for the next few weeks at UCSC's Fleet Services office near the base of campus. Any interested faculty and staff can take the car "out for a spin," whether their interest is job-related or merely personal, said Wes Scott, Fleet Services manager and director of Transportation and Parking Services. "We're just exposing people to the electric car."
</p>The sleek, silvery-blue vehicle has been turning heads on campus since it arrived on loan from the California Environmental Protection Agency in early September. With its rear wheels partially covered by aluminum side panels, the two-seat coupe has a futuristic look.<br>
<br>
When the vehicle is turned on (using an electronic code panel, not a key), the differences between the EV1 and an ordinary car become more apparent. Because the battery-powered car has no engine, there's no engine noise, just a quiet whir or hum as the vehicle rides the campus hills.<br>
<br>
From the electronic wrap-around dashboard to the aluminum body panels to the battery charger above the car's front grille, everything in the EV1 has been reconstructed to reflect that it is an electric car, said Scott.<br>
<br>
The California Environmental Protection Agency has loaned the EV1 to the campus until October 3. The vehicle has been taking a tour of city and county government agencies and educational institutions in the local area.<br>
<br>
Electric vehicles, because they rely on electrical power rather than fossil fuels, are being touted as "vehicles of the future" that will help reduce pollution and smog in California and other states.<br>
<br>
Automobile manufacturers are under mandate to make electric cars 10 percent of all vehicles sold in California by 2003--amounting to about 100,000 electric vehicles a year. The mandate is part of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990.<br>
<br>
The <a href="http://www.gmev.com/">EV1</a> is designed and manufactured by General Motors and sold by Saturn dealerships. The car can drive 50-90 miles per charge depending on the driver's driving style and other factors. A full battery charge takes about three hours to complete.
<p>
  Fleet Services currently has no plans to purchase EV1s or other electric vehicles as part of the campus's fleet, said Scott. "As nice as it would be, it's not practical for us yet in terms of the costs and benefits," he said.
</p>
<p>
  However, he added, if individual units want to lease an EV1 directly from Saturn, Fleet Services would definitely support that decision.<br>
  <br>
  For more information or to schedule a test-drive, call Wes Scott at (831) 459-4289.<br>
