Williams studies the physical and chemical properties of minerals and melts under the high pressure and temperature conditions of planetary interiors. He conducts experiments using a range of high-pressure/high-temperature techniques and couples his experimental results with theoretical calculations and seismic observations. Williams is the 50th winner of the MSA award and the eighth from the UC system. More information about the award is available on the <a href="http://www.minsocam.org">MSA's Web site</a>.
