  The University Events Office has redesigned UCSC's Campus Calendar on the Web. In addition to a cleaner look and simpler interface, the <a href="http://events.ucsc.edu/calendar/">redesigned calendar</a> boasts new features to help sponsors of meetings, performances, lectures, and other campus functions plan and carry out their events, said Karen Hilker of University Events. With the new calendar:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Event sponsors and others can enter information about their events directly onto the Web calendar;
  </li>
  <li>Listings can be updated or corrected by sponsors at any time;
  </li>
  <li>Sponsors can indicate whether they want additional publicity from the listing, such as an on- or off-campus print calendar entry;
  </li>
  <li>Users can list events for planning purposes only and indicate that the event shouldn't be searchable on the Web calendar;
  </li>
  <li>Users can retrieve information via improved "search" and "help" functions.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The benefits of placing a listing in the new calendar are threefold, said Hilker.<br>
  <br>
  First, the listing can help generate publicity for the event through the Web, on-campus publications, or outside media. Second, the calendar can help event planners across campus coordinate their events. Finally, the listings give University Events a "heads up" about the event so the office can provide assistance when needed.<br>
  <br>
  "We'll contact people if there are issues we can help them with, such as signage for the event, parking, or increased shuttle services," said Hilker.<br>
  <br>
  Event sponsors are encouraged to list information about their event as soon as possible, even if the information is incomplete, Hilker added.<br>
  <br>
  University Events uses the calendar information to generate several publicity opportunities, Hilker said. Event information may be included in calendar listings for <i>Currents,</i> <i>The Good Times,</i> KZSC, or the campus cable channel, or it can be printed on a weekly flyer that is distributed campuswide. Event sponsors may also request that their event not be publicized at all.<br>
  <br>
  To enter information onto the Web calendar, event sponsors must obtain a password from the University Events Office. For more information, call (831) 459-5390 or send e-mail to <a href="mailto:calendar@cats.ucsc.edu">calendar@cats.ucsc.edu</a>.
