  The activities and accomplishments of UCSC's Educational Partnership Center are attracting the attention of some high-profile individuals. Most recently, state schools chief Delaine Eastin visited the center and remarked that the resource "stands as an example for other universities, not just in the state of California, but for the rest of the nation."

  Eastin's comments came during a tour of Santa Cruz County in October. Eastin, the state superintendent of public instruction, has visited the sites of educational partnerships that were established by local schools and the university before, but this was her first visit to the center since it moved to its off-campus location across the street from the district office of the Santa Cruz city schools.

  The EPC is the primary resource for teachers and administrators interested in forging partnerships with UCSC. Its goal is to improve higher education opportunities for all children. Eastin toured the center with Francisco Hernandez, vice chancellor for student affairs, and EPC director Carrol Moran. A special exhibition of artwork created by students of local partner schools was on display for the event. Also in attendance were State Senator Bruce McPherson, J. Michael Thompson, associate vice chancellor for outreach, admissions and student academic services, and parents and teachers of children who submitted work for the exhibition.

  The following day, former San Jose mayor Susan Hammer visited the center as a representative of Synopsis Silicon Valley Science &amp; Technology Championship, which encourages participation in local and regional science fairs. Moran highlighted some of the university's science and math outreach initiatives, including the L.A. Basin Program's Magical School Bus tour and the California Math and Science Summer Program. Hammer was joined on her tour by Gary Robinson, president of Synopsis Silicon Valley.
