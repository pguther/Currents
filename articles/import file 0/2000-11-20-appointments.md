  The UCSC-based Center for Research on Education, Diversity &amp; Excellence (CREDE) has appointed Yolanda Padron as the first codirector of the center. Padron is a professor of curriculum and instruction at the University of Houston and a CREDE researcher. She specializes in resiliency among English language learners. As codirector, Padron will oversee the creation of working groups of CREDE researchers, policy makers, and teachers.

  "We're excited and happy Yolanda has joined our leadership team," said CREDE director Roland Tharp, a professor of psychology and education at UCSC. "She's a distinguished researcher, and her excellent work helps us broaden our institutional base and strengthen our regional affiliations."

  UCSC was selected by the federal Department of Education in 1996 to administer CREDE, a national center focused on the needs of students whose education is at risk due to factors such as limited English proficiency, race, poverty, and geographic location. CREDE's goals include identifying the most effective instructional standards for at-risk students and helping to shape federal educational policy to support their needs.<br>
