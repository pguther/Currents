By Mayor's Proclamation, October 10 was declared to be "UC Santa Cruz Students, Faculty, and Staff Day" in the city of Santa Cruz.
<p>
  The proclamation, given to Chancellor Greenwood at the City Council meeting that night, recognizes the "dedication and valuable contributions" UCSC's students and employees make to the community.<br>
  <br>
  The proclamation made particular note of a recent survey that determined that UCSC students, faculty, and staff performed approximately 895,000 hours of community service during summer 1998 and the 1998-99 academic year.
</p>
<p>
  According to the proclamation, that is the equivalent of work that would be done by 429 full-time employees in the community.<br>
