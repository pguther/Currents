Dizikes's book profiles the jockey who changed horse racing by riding in a crouch--the first competitive rider to do so. Dizikes, whose book on opera won the prestigious National Book Critics Circle Award, tells the story of this world's most famous turn-of-the-century jockey. An early review states, "A true gem of a book--a page-turner that is nonetheless full of understated wisdom."

  <b>Judit Moschkovich,</b> an assistant professor of education at UCSC, has contributed chapters to two new books. The first book, from the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, addresses issues of diversity in teaching mathematics. Moschkovich's chapter is entitled "Learning Mathematics in Two Languages: Moving from Obstacles to Resources," which appears in <i>Changing Faces of Mathematics (Vol. 1): Perspectives on Multiculturalism and Gender Equity</i> (Reston, VA: National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, 2000).

  Moschkovich also coauthored a chapter with Mary Brenner, an associate professor of education at UC Santa Barbara, for a collection of writings by math and science education researchers describing the methodologies they use to conduct research. Their chapter, entitled "Integrating a Naturalistic Paradigm into Research on Mathematics and Science Cognition and Learning," appears in the new book <i>Handbook of Research Design in Mathematics and Science Education</i> (Mahwah, N.J.: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 2000).<br>
