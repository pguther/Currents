  Some of the most stunning reproductions of the work of William Blake, Marcel Duchamp, and many other artists was produced in Paris between the 1940s and 1980s by a small but eminent publishing house named the Trianon Press. Established by Arnold Fawcus and operated by Fawcus and his wife, Julie, who continued the business after Arnold's death, the press quickly gained an international reputation for excellence for its exquisite publications.<br>
</p><br>
In the early 1980s, Julie Fawcus designated UCSC as the home for the press's materials. The acquisition of the Trianon Press Archive was widely considered one of the major achievements in the history of Special Collections, which houses the rare and valuable materials of the University Library.<br>
<br>
An exhibition on display in McHenry Library through December presents some of the treasures of the archive.
<p>
  Exhibition coordinator Maureen Carey and several other library staff had their work cut out for them in selecting which items to display from the extensive archive. To get a sense of the breadth of the archive, it helps to know that it arrived in two massive shipments. The first, which came in 1983, was packed in a 900-cubic-foot container that weighed some five tons. A second, similar shipment arrived in 1988.<br>
  <br>
  The Trianon Press Archive includes manuscripts, proof copies, variant editions, plans, design work, correspondence, unpublished artworks, maquettes, negatives, color decompositions, guide sheets, and stencils. The unrivaled set of the press's collection of its own works numbers more than 70 volumes, many of which are the publisher's unnumbered deluxe copies.<br>
  <br>
  The exhibit features insights into the personalities of the Trianon Press, some of the productions of the press, and a display of volumes demonstrating the techniques of the facsimile reproduction used to create the beautiful volumes of the archive.<br>
  <br>
  A <a href="http://bob.ucsc.edu/library/exhibits/trianon/tpexh.html">virtual exhibit</a> of the archive has been posted and will remain online indefinitely. The exhibit contains text, illustrations, and photographs on the press and its founder as well as links to the William Blake Archive hypermedia archive, an oral history of Julie Fawcus (produced by UCSC's Regional History Project staff), and many other sites.
