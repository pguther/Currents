<p>
  Communications and Technology Services (CATS) is imposing limits on incoming message sizes and server storage for users of "@cats.ucsc.edu" e-mail addresses.
</p>
<p>
  The limits are necessary, according to a letter from CATS, due to an increasing load on the "cats-po-1" server that holds mail for users with "cats" e-mail addresses. CATS plans a hardware upgrade in fall quarter 2000, which is expected to address the problem at that time.
</p>
<p>
  Effective August 31, CATS will enforce these limits:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>A 5 MB limit on incoming message sizes destined for cats e-mail addresses. This size limit would not affect e-mail destined for departmental e-mail servers (for example, @biology.ucsc.edu or @cse.ucsc.edu) nor would it affect outgoing mail.<br>
    <br>
  </li>
  <li>A 7 MB limit on server storage of read messages for active mail readers. This is for mail stored on the server. This limit will not affect users who download all their mail to their desktop systems or to their timeshare accounts via "pine."
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  For more information, please see an <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/cats/sc/help/news/2000/00.08.18.email.shtml">article</a>, "CATS introduces operational limits on e-mail," on the CATS web site.<br>
  <br>
  Faculty, staff, and students with questions or problems may contact CATS through the Information Resource Center at 459-HELP, Monday-Friday, from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., excluding the lunch hour (noon-1 p.m.) and holidays. You can also send e-mail to <a href="mailto:infocat@cats.ucsc.edu">infocat@cats.ucsc.edu</a>.
