  Dear Colleagues,
</p>
<p>
  The Senate leaders and Office have received many inquiries regarding the status of the mail ballot on mandatory grades. Although somewhat premature, this note is to inform the Senate that all necessary materials for the ballot have already been collected and given to the Committee on Rules, Jurisdiction, and Elections (RJ&amp;E) for review. After any required changes and final approval by RJ&amp;E, another week is then needed for the Senate Office to print and prepare the ballots before distribution to all Senators. Assuming no unanticipated delays, Senators can expect to receive the ballots well before mid-October and a due date roughly two weeks later. We are optimistic that the final count by RJ&amp;E will be completed before the first regular Senate meeting scheduled for 9 Nov 2000.<br>
  <br>
  Respectfully yours,<br>
  <br>
  David Koo<br>
  Secretary, Santa Cruz Division
