  If your idea of a barbecue is burgers and ribs, come expand your horizons and enjoy the grilled bounty of the UCSC Farm &amp; Garden at a benefit dinner on Thursday, September 21, at the Merrill College Provost's House. Cost is $20 per person, which includes dinner, herbal tea, beer, and dessert. The festivities begin at 5:15 p.m. with a tour of the Alan Chadwick Garden by Garden Manager Orin Martin. The dinner of flavorful organic grilled vegetables will be prepared by chef Robert Morris of Blacks Beach Cafe. Diners will see just how easy it is to turn their garden bounty into a delicious grilled meal. The event is sponsored by the Friends of the UCSC Farm &amp; Garden and the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems at UC Santa Cruz. The cost of the dinner for members of the friends group is $15; memberships will be available at the event. Reservations are required.
