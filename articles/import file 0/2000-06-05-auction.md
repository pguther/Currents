  Special meals, fly-fishing adventures, and Hawaiian vacations are among the items to be auctioned off at Long Marine Lab's 15th annual Whale of an Auction. Enjoy a catered buffet and sample fine wines, champagne, and caviar while bidding on a grand array of offerings available nowhere else. The fun begins at 6 p.m. in the Porter College Dining Hall on Friday, June 16. All proceeds support the public education programs at the Seymour Center at Long Marine Laboratory. The auction items donated so far include wetsuits, fine wines, natural history tours, a private sail for 40 on the Team O'Neill catamaran, a romantic stay at La Casa de Espiritus Alegres in Mexico, and a VIP birthday party at Long Marine Lab's new Seymour Marine Discovery Center. Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood is offering a private dinner for 12 at University House. Also up for bid will be special behind-the-scenes tours of the Monterey Bay Aquarium, Sea World, Ano Nuevo State Reserve, and the Seymour Center. The annual event, sponsored by the Friends of Long Marine Lab, raises tens of thousands of dollars for the lab's efforts to inform schoolchildren and the general public about the Monterey Bay marine environment and marine research at UCSC. The Seymour Center at Long Marine Lab is dedicated to educating people about the role scientific research plays in the understanding and conservation of the world's oceans. All programs and daily operations of the Seymour Center depend on community support. Tickets for the auction are $40 in advance ($35 for members) and $45 at the door. To order tickets call (831) 459-2883. Donations to the auction or to the lab's education programs are welcome. For more information call (831) 459-2784.
