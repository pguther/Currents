  UCSC's growth mirrors what's happening at campuses statewide, as the UC, California State University, and Community College systems gear up to serve an unprecedented number of new students in the state. At the UC system alone, it is estimated that space will be needed for 63,000 additional academically eligible students by the year 2010.<br>
  <br>
  As one of the state's public campuses, UC Santa Cruz is preparing to do its part to provide for those students. Enrollment at UCSC last fall was 11,300, and the campus's Long-Range Development Plan, adopted in 1988, projects growth to 15,000 students by the year 2005.<br>
  <br>
  As UCSC considers how it might accommodate its share of UC's additional 63,000 students, one scenario under discussion would have UCSC grow by an additional 1,900 students--to 16,900--by the year 2010.<br>
