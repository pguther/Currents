<h4>
  <font color="#003399"><b>Diversity dialogue group leaders</b></font>
</h4>
<p>
  <img align="right" border="0" height="169" src="../art/diversity_dialog.220.jpg" width="220" alt="">Small groups of campus staff have been meeting twice a month this year to discuss topics related to diversity. In these "diversity dialogue groups," individuals talk, listen, and learn about perceptions of differences and the fears that keep people apart. This year more than 30 people participated in diversity dialogue groups led by six staff members who underwent training to become group leaders. This year's leaders, pictured right, are (l-r) Pat Clark (Physical Plant), Lynda Tanaka (EEO/AA), Candace Ward (TAPS), Kathleen Hughes (OPERS), and Ricki Carr (Accounts Payable); not pictured: Kristin Rowe (Crown College). The groups are a project of the Diversity Education Program in the office of Equal Employment Opportunity/Affirmative Action.
