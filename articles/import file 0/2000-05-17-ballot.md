  The following letter was distributed to members of UCSC's Academic Senate today (May 17, 2000) by Roger Anderson, senate chair:

  Dear Colleagues:<br>
  <br>
  Last week, after receiving inquiries from Senators regarding the exact language of the legislation as amended and passed at the 23 Feb 2000 Senate meeting; the accuracy of the unapproved minutes; and the legitimacy of the legislation included with the mail ballot on grading, Secretary David Koo requested a ruling on the validity of the mail ballot from the Committee on Rules, Jurisdiction, and Election (RJ&amp;E). Counting of ballots is pending until a written ruling from RJ&amp;E is issued.<br>
