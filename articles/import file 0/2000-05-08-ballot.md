<p>
  A "mail ballot" has been distributed asking all 588 members of UCSC's Academic Senate to weigh in on the proposal to implement UC's conventional grading system for entering UCSC students in fall 2001. The request for such a ballot was made by 27 senate members and had been expected in the wake of the senate's 154-77 vote in February to place UCSC's grading policies in line with other UC campuses.

<p>
  Mary-Beth Harhen, director of the senate office, said ballots are due by 5 p.m. on Friday, May 12. They must be received in the senate office (125 Kerr Hall) by that time. Any member of the senate not receiving a mail ballot--they were distributed the week of April 24--should contact the senate office by phone (831) 459-2086) or by e-mail (<a href="mailto:senate@cats">senate@cats</a>). Information on the vote is also available on the senate Web site at (<a href="http://senate.ucsc.edu/mailball/grading">senate.ucsc.edu/mailball/grading</a>).
</p>
<p>
  The grades resolution will be decided by a simple majority, and the outcome of the vote should be known prior to the next senate meeting, scheduled for May 31. At that meeting, senators are scheduled to discuss the campus's Narrative Evaluation System. The May 31 meeting, which will take place in Classroom Unit 2, begins at 2 p.m.
