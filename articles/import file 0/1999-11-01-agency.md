<p>
  Gov. Gray Davis has signed SB 645, a bill passed by the Legislature<br>
  requiring "agency shop" at the University of California and California<br>
  State University. The new law takes effect Jan. 1, 2000, and will result in<br>
  mandatory paycheck deductions for union-represented UC employees who do not currently pay union membership dues.<br>
  <br>
  The bill states that, "as a condition of continued employment," UC<br>
  employees who are in a bargaining unit exclusively represented by a union<br>
  must either join the union and pay its dues or pay a "fair share" fee to<br>
  the union. This fee would help cover the union's costs for negotiation,<br>
  contract administration and related activities.<br>
  <br>
  The amount of the "fair share" fee will be determined by each of the<br>
  University's unions. The bill states that the fee shall not exceed the<br>
  union's regular membership dues.<br>
  <br>
  UC faculty who are eligible for Academic Senate membership are exempt from<br>
  the bill.<br>
  <br>
  The University opposed the union-sponsored measure in the Legislature,<br>
  arguing that UC employees should have the opportunity to vote on any<br>
  "agency shop" arrangement before it is put into place. UC's view did not<br>
  prevail in the legislative process, however. The University now is<br>
  committed to fulfilling its legal obligations to implement the new law and<br>
  will be working with UC's unions on the details of implementation.<br>
  <br>
  According to the legislation, the "fair share" deductions are to begin<br>
  "upon notification to the employer by the exclusive representative," but no<br>
  sooner than Jan. 1. UC will be discussing the implementation timeline with<br>
  each of its unions and is currently examining the payroll processing<br>
  changes necessary to implement the "fair share" deductions. Additional<br>
  information about this process will be provided as it becomes available.<br>
  <br>
  The bill allows an employee "who is a member of a bona fide religion, body<br>
  or sect that has historically held conscientious objections to joining or<br>
  financially supporting public employee organizations" to instead pay an<br>
  amount equivalent to the "fair share" fee to a "nonreligious, nonlabor<br>
  charitable fund." The union and the University may designate a list of such<br>
  charitable funds to which conscientious objectors may direct their<br>
  contribution.<br>
  <br>
  Employees who are unsure if they are in a bargaining unit represented by a<br>
  union and thus affected by the new law should contact their supervisor or<br>
  their local Office of Labor Relations. Those with questions about the<br>
  details of implementation, including the amount of a union's "fair share"<br>
  fee or the procedures for conscientious objectors, should contact their<br>
  union directly.<br>
  <br>
  Under the legislation, the "agency shop" arrangement may be rescinded by a<br>
  majority vote of all employees in a bargaining unit if at least 30 percent<br>
  of the employees in that unit petition for such a vote. The election would<br>
  be administered by the state Public Employment Relations Board.<br>
  <br>
  Thirteen unions represent more than 60,000 UC employees in 31 bargaining<br>
  units. These unions and their corresponding bargaining units are:
