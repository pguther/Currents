  Transportation and Parking Services (TAPS) is conducting UCSC's Spring 2000 Transportation Survey. Designed to assess the travel patterns and habits of faculty, staff, and students, TAPS will use the survey results to help plan new transportation programs and infrastructure improvements to better accommodate the needs of the campus community, said Larry Pageler, campus transportation planner.

  The survey, which originally had a deadline of May 19, can now be completed on or before May 26. As an incentive, respondents who complete the survey by the deadline and provide an e-mail address or phone number are eligible to win one of five $100 cash prizes.

  The survey will also be used to provide a "baseline" for comparison of future traffic conditions and a means of measuring the success of UCSC's various Travel Demand Management (TDM) programs, he said.<br>

  It's been five years since UCSC participated in this type of commuter survey, and even longer since student commuters were included in the respondent pool. The ten-question survey asks respondents to describe their campus commute trips for each day of the previous week, May 7-11.<br>
  <br>
  This is also TAPS' first online survey, a step that dramatically reduces data entry time while conserving paper. If successful, TAPS hopes to conduct several more online surveys during this calendar year to address other specific transportation and parking issues. In order to accommodate staff and students without Internet access or who are having difficulty accessing the online survey, printed copies of the Spring 2000 Transportation Survey are available by calling TAPS at 459-2190.<br>
