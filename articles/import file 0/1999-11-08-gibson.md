  Margaret Gibson, a professor of education and anthropology, has received a federal grant of nearly $500,000 to expand a research project at Aptos High School that is exploring the role of peer influence in achievement among students of Mexican descent. Gibson's latest infusion of support comes from the U.S. Department of Education/Office of Educational Research and Improvement. The three-year grant for $495,489 will enable her to follow her research subjects at Aptos High through their graduation in 2002. It will also allow Gibson and her team of researchers to expand their scope and conduct some comparative work at several other high schools beginning next year. Gibson's study, which began last year, is looking closely at students' informal relationships with each other, as well as with teachers and other school personnel, to learn how peers affect students' identities and orientations toward schooling. The Spencer Foundation provided a grant for $459,500 to support the initial project, which was a two-year study based at Aptos High, where nearly half of the freshman class is of Mexican descent. The National Science Foundation also provided a grant of about $50,000 for the first year. The project has implications for schools that are trying to find more effective ways to meet the needs of all students, said Gibson, who is eager to identify positive interventions that cut through the ambivalence, resistance, or sense of alienation that can prevent students from being engaged. Aptos High is recognized for its strong academic programs, yet student performance reflects disturbing national and state patterns of disproportionately low academic achievement among students of Mexican descent. In 1996, only 20 percent of Aptos High seniors of Mexican descent who graduated had completed advanced math and science classes, compared to 74 percent of white seniors.
