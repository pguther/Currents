</h4>
<p>
  In honor of his 60th birthday, linguistics professor Jorge Hankamer received a festschrift from dozens of colleagues, friends, students, and former students. The festschrift is traditionally a volume of writings by different authors that honors a specific person. This particular publication, masterminded by Linguistics Department faculty and staff, is electronic and consists of roughly 45 "squibs" (short papers on linguistics) and birthday greetings; the site even includes digital movies and a watercolor jpeg. <a href="http://ling.ucsc.edu/Jorge">Festschrift web site</a>.
