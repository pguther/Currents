  Faculty and staff will enjoy good food and conversation with their colleagues at two events planned for late October. For faculty, a buffet-style "strolling dinner" is planned for Wednesday, October 27, at University House. The dinner will start immediately following the Academic Senate meeting that day, at approximately 5 p.m. Staff are invited to a picnic at the East Field on Friday, October 22, from 11:30-1:30 p.m. The picnic will feature a variety of foods, including deli-style sandwiches, salads, cakes, and cookies. Drawing on the tradition of staff barbecues from past years, participants will have access to the OPERS pool, lockers, and towels at no charge during the event. Staff will be provided release time to participate in the picnic, but campus offices normally open during the noon hour should remain open. Staff who wish to attend the picnic are requested to RSVP as soon as possible to Jeff Rockwell via e-mail at <a href="mailto:jrock@cats.ucsc.edu">jrock@cats.ucsc.edu</a>. Offices are encouraged to e-mail Rockwell with a "head count" for people they expect to attend. Staff are strongly advised to ride the campus shuttles to the barbecue, as construction taking place on campus is expected to limit the parking available in the East Field lot. In case of rain, the picnic will be moved to Cowell Dining Hall.
