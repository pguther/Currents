  The Northern California chapter of the Achievement Rewards for College Scientists (ARCS) Foundation has provided $80,000 in scholarships this year for ten UCSC students. The 2000 ARCS scholars were honored at the foundation's annual luncheon last month at the St. Francis Hotel in San Francisco. The ARCS Foundation is a national organization that provides scholarships and fellowships for the country's most promising science, medical, and engineering students. The foundation is the most generous provider of annual student awards to the UCSC campus. The 2000 ARCS scholars represent the Science Communication Program and the Departments of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Computer Science, Earth Sciences, Ocean Sciences, and Physics. Six UCSC graduate students received $10,000 ARCS scholarships: Anouk Shambrook and Kurtis Williams (astronomy and astrophysics); Terrence Furey (computer science); Glenn Spinelli (Earth sciences); Myra Finkelstein (ocean sciences); and Joshua Gray (physics). Four students in the Science Communication Program each received a $5,000 ARCS scholarship, which was matched by a donation from a private donor.
