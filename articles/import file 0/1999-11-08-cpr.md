</p>Susan Willats knows firsthand how important training in cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can be.<br>
<br>
Willats was working at Natural Sciences 2 in July when a fellow Business and Administrative Services staff member ran into her office and asked if she knew CPR. A Summer Session student, who wishes to remain anonymous, had collapsed in a nearby hallway. The young woman's classmates were standing nearby, not knowing what to do.<br>
<br>
"It was such an unreal situation," Willats recalled. "I'd taken several CPR classes and had never been called upon to use any of that information. I was amazingly calm, maybe because the situation felt so unreal."<br>
<br>
The student's heart was beating, but she had stopped breathing. When Willats opened the victim's airway and began mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, the woman's lungs responded, "like they suddenly remembered what they should be doing," Willats said.<br>
<br>
When the young woman stopped breathing for a second time, Willats resuscitated her again.<br>
<br>
It wasn't until paramedics took the student away on a gurney that Willats felt the impact of what had happened. "That's when I got shaky," she said.<br>
<br>
Willats--whose office was moved into Natural Sciences 2 just the week before--was thankful she'd had CPR training. "You're not given the opportunity very often to make such an incredible difference in someone's life," she said.<br>
<br>
Willats had taken a CPR class through the UCSC Fire Department in 1987 and a refresher course in 1989. Four years ago, she had also participated in a pediatric CPR course at Dominican Hospital.<br>
<br>
She encourages others to take CPR. "You never know what you're going to find around the next corner."<br>
<br>
CPR classes are available locally from the American Red Cross at (831) 462-2881 and at Dominican Hospital at (831) 462-7709. The American Red Cross also offers courses in first aid.<br>
<br>
