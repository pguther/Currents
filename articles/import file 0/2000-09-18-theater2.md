<h4>
  Writer/Director/Actor/Composer<br>
  October 28: <i>Romeo Sierra Tango</i>
</h4>
<p>
  Eckert, the child of two opera singers, began performing at the age of five and never stopped. He writes, composes music for, performs, and frequently directs his own work, which has drawn unabashed praise from even the most jaded New York theater critics. Eckert has performed in every style imaginable, from, as he says, "the wildest avant-garde to most traditional opera--straight Shakespeare, bent Shakespeare, sung Shakespeare, Verdi, Puccini, Mozart, and Brecht." His own creations include solo pieces, full-length plays, musicals, and opera. <i>Romeo</i> is Eckert's own radical take on the character from the Shakespeare play.

  "The purposes of theater are manifold. There are many levels of approach, and certainly entertainment is part of the quotient. But entertainment is a broad category. If you use the word 'fun,' well, for some people fun is going to the bowling alley while others would like to sit down and read Greek tragedy. And entertainment in Greek tragedy is a chorus coming in and telling you that Clytemnestra has slaughtered Agamemnon--it's not exactly <i>Pet Detective</i>. So there are real different conceptions of fun.<br>
  <br>
  What I like in theater is to have a variety of experiences--I like comedy and I like tragedy and I like them together. Sheer fun is important too, and I'm not above a pratfall. If a double take works, fine. Vaudeville? Song and dance? Great. But I also like intellectual turns. I like to stand things on their head and challenge the accepted visions of things. I like intellectual gymnastics. So the piece will go from a simple relationship with fun to a more complicated relationship with fun. I'm after an audience that wants to go to all those places.<br>
  <br>
  One thing I would say is that theater tends to be treated as if it's similar to, say, cinema. I think people tend to forget how old this medium is. It's an older art form than practically anything except maybe painting, which goes back to cave painting. I'm drawn by the sense of being an active participant in this ancient and venerable practice. It makes live theater an unbeatable event."
