<p>
  The <a href="http://arts.ucsc.edu/sesnon">Sesnon Art Gallery</a> opens its 1999-2000 exhibition season with an exhibit of work by Pulitzer Prize-winning artist Art Spiegelman in the exhibit, "CRASH! Comix and graphics by Art Spiegelman."<br>
</p><br>
Spiegelman has redefined perceptions of comics as an artistic medium, challenging the distinction between high and low art by using comics in historical and theoretical contexts. Spiegelman is the cofounder and editor of <i>RAW</i> magazine, a cutting-edge anthology of cartooning and graphic experimentalism. He is perhaps best known for his Pulitzer Prize-winning books, <i>Maus I</i> and <i>Maus II,</i> in which he portrays the life of his father (in the form of a mouse) during the Holocaust, trying to survive the brutalities of the Nazis (portrayed as cats) first in his town and then in concentration camps.<br>
<br>
The exhibit highlights Spiegelman's current work, the exploration of comix journalism and comix autobiography, as well as earlier work. A range of media will be used, from CD ROMs to a display of original sketches.<br>
<br>
The exhibition continues through Sunday, November 21. A public reception will be held on Friday, October 8, from 4 to 6 p.m. in conjunction with an exhibition in the Porter Faculty Gallery, "My Mother Threw Mine Away," curated by Joe Ferraro from Atlantis Fantasyworld.<br>
<br>
The exhibition is also running in conjuntion with a public talk by Spiegelman, which launches <a href="http://events.ucsc.edu/artslecs/">Arts &amp; Lectures'</a> 1900-2000 season. The talk, "Comix 101," takes place on October 7 at 8 p.m. in the Theater Arts Mainstage. For ticket information or to receive an Arts &amp; Lectures' season brochure, call (831) 459-2159.<br>
