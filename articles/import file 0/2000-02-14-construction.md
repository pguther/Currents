  In order to inform members of the UCSC community of the impacts of construction on campus, <i>Currents</i> is now posting monthly updates on any construction projects that affect transportation and parking. In addition, this update includes information on the Mission Street widening project, due to start in March.
</p>
<h3>
  Interdisciplinary Sciences Building
</h3>
<p>
  Expect traffic delays on <b>Steinhart Way</b>, the service road to the Science Library, Earth and Marine Sciences, and Natural Sciences 2. The loading dock to Natural Sciences 2 will be closed. Pedestrian paths will be rerouted along the construction site, and the pedestrian bridge to the Cowell Health Center will be closed. Construction will continue through fall 2001.
</p>
<h3>
  Core West Parking Structure
</h3>
<p>
  Materials and concrete delivery trucks will travel up <b>Heller Drive</b>, turn right onto <b>McLaughlin Drive</b>, and right onto <b>Steinhart Way</b>. Expect traffic delays on these roads in the project area probably through the summer.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Parking Lot 114</b> in front of Thimann Labs and across from the parking structure is available only to cars with A and B parking permits. Parking permits are enforced 24 hours every day.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Parking Lots 112 and 113</b> by Sinsheimer Labs and McLaughlin Drive are permanently closed.<br>
  <br>
  In order to compensate for these lost parking spaces, the <b>North Remote Parking Lot</b> is now reserved for cars with A and B parking permits and is no longer available for remote parking permits. <b>New shuttle service</b> between the North Remote Parking Lot and Science Hill is now offered. The Day East Remote Core route serves these areas every 15 minutes between 7:30 a.m. and 6 p.m. weekdays. The Express Night Core route provides drop-off service to the North Remote Lot weeknights after 6 p.m. <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/taps/maps.html">New maps and schedules</a> are available at the TAPS Web site.
</p>
<h3>
  Bay Tree Bookstore expansion and Graduate Commons
</h3>
<p>
  There will be occasional traffic delays due to construction vehicles in the immediate area. Expect construction noise. The short section of <b>Hagar Drive</b> between Steinhart Way and McLaughlin Drive continues to be a one-way street. This project will continue through summer 2000.
</p>
<h3>
  College Nine Apartments
</h3>
<p>
  <b>Parking Lot 164</b> across from the Village and close to Social Sciences 2 is available only to cars with A and B parking permits. Parking permits are enforced 24 hours every day.

  The first major stage of construction on <b>Mission Street from Chestnut Street to Otis Street and possibly to Rigg Street</b> is slated to begin in March and continue through October. Northbound underground work, consisting of drainage, water, and sewer work, will occur through July.<br>
