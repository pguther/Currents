  UCSC received a visit last week from a welcome guest--Eastman Kodak Company representative Pamela Zeh.
</p>Zeh was welcomed by Film and Digital Media professor and department chair Eli Hollander, who took her on a tour of Film and Digital Media facilities in the Communications Building. Zeh looked in on a film studio and screening, editing, and equipment rooms as well as several classes in progress.<br>
<br>
Zeh also met with facilities manager Paul Wrangell and later presented a plaque to Arts Dean Edward Houghton. The plaque recognized the academic excellence of UCSC's film program and marked the gift of $2,000 in film supplies from Kodak to UCSC.<br>
<br>
"Kodak's gift is a nice addition to our resources," said Hollander. "Because of this grant, we are able to introduce students to 16mm film in the introductory production class. It's an exceptional opportunity for them to be able to work with film at that level and shows them an important dimension in the field that they might not otherwise experience until much later in their course of studies."<br>
<br>
Kodak's support extends beyond the grant. In addition, the company will provide students with such resources as textbooks and access to training films. Zeh will return to UCSC several times over the course of the year to conduct sessions with Film and Digital Media students.<br>
<br>
This is the second year in a row that UCSC has received a grant from Kodak, which is based in Rochester, N.Y.
