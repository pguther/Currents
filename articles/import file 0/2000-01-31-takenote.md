</h4>
<p>
  <img align="right" border="0" height="123" src="../art/thumbsup.1.gif" width="106" alt="">Human Resources is once again sponsoring the popular Thumbs Up Award Program for staff. It is the only recognition program in which all staff and administrators are eligible to participate, and everyone who is nominated receives a certificate of appreciation and a small gift. Awards can be given to an individual staff member, a team, or a faculty member in an administrative role for providing special service to the campus community. Every nominee is a winner.
</p>
<p>
  The nomination process this year will be similar to last year. Staff will be able to submit a maximum of five nominations via the Web during three weeks in March, and staff who do not have access to the Web will be able to send written nominations to Susan Taylor, c/o Chancellor's Office. The 2000 Thumbs Up Award announcement and detailed guidelines will be mailed to all staff, via campus mail, during February.

  Work will continue on the new <b>Bay Tree Bookstore and Graduate Commons Buildings</b> through summer 2000. There will be occasional traffic delays due to construction vehicles.
