  The Ocean Sciences Department has awarded the 1999-2000 Ocean Sciences Outstanding Student Achievement Award to graduate student Scott Shaffer. The award recognizes overall scientific excellence, achievement, and promise coupled with outstanding service to the scientific and public communities. The $100 award is made possible by the generosity of anonymous donors. Shaffer received his Ph.D. in biology this year, just three years after completing his M.S. degree in marine sciences. Professor of biology Daniel Costa and associate professor of biology Terrie Williams served as his coadvisers for both degrees. "[Shaffer] has been an excellent student, an outstanding citizen, and has tremendous potential as an academic and representative of UCSC," Costa said. "He is without question one of the finest students to come out of my laboratory." Shaffer's research for his master's thesis examined the diving behavior of beluga whales. His thesis was published in and made the cover of the <i>Journal of Experimental Biology</i> in December 1997. For his Ph.D. thesis, Shaffer studied the physiology of flight in two species of albatross. Both of these projects involved collaborations with other institutions: The beluga whale research was carried out at the U.S. Navy research laboratory in San Diego, and the albatross studies at two French Antarctic stations in collaboration with the French Antarctic Research Program. In both cases, according to Costa, Shaffer served as a superb ambassador for UCSC's programs, impressing his collaborators and paving the way for other UCSC students to work with these institutions. Shaffer has presented his research at various scientific meetings and recently received the award for "Best Student Paper" at the Pacific Seabird Group meeting in February. He has also given public lectures, most recently to the Northern California Chapter of the Audubon Society. Shaffer also serves as a graduate student representative to the Chancellor's Animal Research Committee. In addition to his considerable skills as a researcher, Shaffer is an accomplished teacher. He was the senior teaching assistant in Costa's Marine Mammal Biology class and was responsible for creating several new laboratory sections for that course. He also gave several lectures to the class and will be teaching <i>Marine Mammal Biology</i> this summer.
