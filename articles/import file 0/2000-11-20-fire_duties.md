  Like fire departments nationally, the vast majority of the 500 calls fielded annually by the UCSC Fire Department are not fire-related. About 80 percent are emergency medical services, or EMS, calls. Other calls include nuisance and false alarms, elevator rescues, hazardous materials spills, cave rescues, and water vacuuming to clean up leaks and flooding. The bulk of each workday is spent performing nonemergency fire-prevention services. With the exception of historic structures like the Blacksmith Shop, every building on campus is equipped with a fire alarm. "Early warning" systems, including alarms and fire and heat detectors, alert the campus's emergency dispatcher of potential problems. In addition, UCSC boasts many well-designed buildings that incorporate fire-rated walls, doors, windows, and utility shafts. Although smoking remains the most common cause of fires nationally, the biggest cause of fires on campus is candles, which UCSC policy technically allows only as decorative items. Some calls, like cave rescues, are due to UCSC's terrain. Others reflect the unique population of a college community. The range of medical calls at UCSC varies from sports injuries and muscle cramps to alcohol or drug-related calls and suicide attempts. Bicycle accidents are all too common, said Captain Mike Quinton. "Last year, a woman crashed her bike on the dirt road near the Farm," he said. "Her helmet was literally split in two. When the paramedics got there, they said, 'We told you to get a helmet.' It turned out she'd been in a bike accident in town the week before without a helmet. This time she had one, and it saved her head." Lots of the work is routine, including conducting safety inspections, servicing campus fire extinguishers and hydrants; providing campus CPR and first aid training; inspecting fire alarms, sprinklers, and smoke detectors; and conducting public education programs. Additionally, firefighters spend dozens of hours each year in training programs so they'll literally be ready for anything. "In the 30 years I've been a firefighter, we've added so many skills--hazardous material spills, releases, and response training; confined space rescues; and emergency medical response," said Quinton, who lately has been studying the hazards of cutting into electric cars to rescue victims of vehicle accidents. "That's the thrill of this job--the inventory of skills, knowledge, and education we have to maintain. You could never train enough." And every now and then, something truly bizarre happens. "We got a call one weekend that an aircraft was down over by Oakes College," said Quinton. "On the way over, I was trying to get more information, but it turned out the pilot of this two-seater plane had deliberately landed on the grass there. He was fine--he said he'd had carburetor trouble. When he wanted to take off, I pointed out that his 'runway' was full of gopher holes and rocks, but he did it anyway. That was something." UCSC firefighters work ten 24-hour shifts per month, rotating through four spare bedrooms and sharing meals in a combined kitchen/living area at the campus Fire Station near the Crown-Merrill Apartments. In addition to the obvious risks of fighting fires, on-the-job hazards lurk in unexpected places, such as on the scene of automobile accidents. Firefighters have suffered broken arms when air bags activated as they tried to rescue trapped motorists, said Quinton. Nevertheless, Quinton said he feels safer responding to calls today than when he became a firefighter three decades ago, largely because of advancements in the protective gear firefighters wear and the availability of more sophisticated firefighting and medical tools. The origins of the UCSC Fire Department lie in the ashes of the most spectacular fire the campus has experienced. In April 1971, Hahn Student Services burned to the ground, leaving only the concrete walls behind. With the flames went all of the registrar's historical records and admissions data. The fire, which broke out in the middle of the night, was caused by an extension cord that had become frayed by foot traffic in what was then the Chancellor's Office. The building lacked any early warning systems--no alarm, no fire detectors, no sprinklers. And the campus lacked a fire department. By the time a resident in town noticed the plume of smoke and called the city fire department, the building was completely engulfed by flames. Later that year, the UCSC Fire Department was established. The current station, located near the Crown-Merrill Apartments, opened in 1975 when that area was considered the center of what was then planned as a 27-college university.
