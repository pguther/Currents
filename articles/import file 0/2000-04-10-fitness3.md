  A recent spring day found chemistry professor Gene Switkes on the tennis courts with no hint of the back injury that sidelined him in February. Switkes attributes the speediness of his recovery in part to the use of equipment in UCSC's new Wellness Center.
</p>"People get 'old-age' backs--or middle-aged backs--where they periodically get a twinge," said Switkes. "The center gives you a chance to work it out rather than just sit and wait."
<p>
  After straining his back, Switkes checked in briefly with center director Ryan Andrews and modified his workout routine to emphasize the use of machines that would aid his recuperation. He started out slowly and gradually added weight until he was back in form. "It's a good way to work out a soreness," said Switkes, who focused on stretching and strengthening his back without straining it.
</p>
<p>
  Switkes's commitment to exercise didn't waiver during winter's wet weather. He maintained his regular workout schedule, hitting the Wellness Center two to three times a week and augmenting those sessions with tennis and jogging when the weather cooperated.
</p>
<p>
  Now that he's back on the courts returning serves from regular partner Dean Fitch and others, Switkes has noted improved stamina. "I don't seem to score any more points against Dean, but I'm less tired afterwards," he said.
</p>
<p>
  A fringe benefit of working out in the new Wellness Center is the opportunity it provides to interact informally with chemistry graduate students, many of whom are "finding their way down there," said Switkes. "It's a nice common denominator."
</p>
<p>
  Switkes has become more familiar with the electronic gadgetry on the center's state-of-the-art exercise machines, and he is a regular on the cross-trainer, the stationary bicycle, and the "pecs, legs, and abs" machines. "The abs machines on the first and second floors appear to be the most popular in the whole place," he notes. "I think it's a clear sign of society's vanity." Switkes steers clear of the machines that focus heavily on back muscles, and he prefers to jog outdoors on the track than use the treadmill. After all, he adds with a good-humored nod to vanity, "We've got to work on our tans!"<br>
