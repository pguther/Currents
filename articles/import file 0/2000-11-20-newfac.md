</p>Professor of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology<br>
<br>
John Thompson studies how interactions among species organize the earth's biodiversity over broad geographic landscapes. His long-term goal is to understand how coevolution between plants and animals connects biological communities both locally and globally. He is also concerned with how humans are reshaping the ecology and evolution of species interactions by fragmenting landscapes and introducing new species. Thompson's work combines ecological, genetic, molecular, and evolutionary approaches to address questions on how evolution and coevolution affect ecological processes. Thompson received his B.A. in biology from Washington and Jefferson College and his Ph.D. in ecology from the University of Illinois, Urbana. Before joining the UCSC faculty, he was a professor of botany and zoology at Washington State University.<br>
