  When the Lula Washington Dance Theatre performs in Santa Cruz on April 15, it will be the second visit here this academic year. And, in a very dancelike act of symmetry, the company will perform a piece conceived, in part, during the previous visit. That visit was sponsored by UCSC's Arts &amp; Lectures program, which is presenting the upcoming performance.
</p>The company, which celebrates its 20th anniversary this year, is one of southern California's best-known African American dance troupes. Choreographer Lula Washington has developed a distinctive style for her company that is athletic and theatrical. Washington also uses her pieces to voice social and political themes--previous pieces have addressed such events and issues as the Rodney King beating, Washington's nephew's gang-related murder, abortion, and abused women.<br>
<br>
The company's distinction comes not only from its political sensibilities and supercharged dance styles, but from the music it uses. Washington grew up listening to Motown and the blues, and she uses the music she loves in her work--Ray Charles, Marvin Gaye, Tina Turner, B. B. King, Bobbie Blue Bland, Etta James, Smokey Robinson, Duke Ellington, and Bob Marley are among the musicians whose work she has used.<br>
<br>
But this past year, Washington decided it was time for a change. And so, while much of the Santa Cruz show will be trademark Washington, a new piece--"Rites 2000"--features classical music by Vivaldi, Stravinsky, Chopin, Bach, and John Tavener. "Rites" is the piece that Washington developed in Santa Cruz and in other community workshops around the country. It was also made possible, in part, through a commission by seven organizations, including UCSC's Arts &amp; Lectures.<br>
<br>
"I've never used classical music before and it was a personal challenge for me, a way to move into the new millennium," says Washington of her uncharacteristic choice. "I had already decided I wanted to experiment with classical music and my first thought was Stravinsky's 'Rite of Spring.' It's a great piece, but I couldn't connect with it, the music didn't work for me. But when I started thinking in a slightly different direction, it began to work. In fact, when I found the right music, it helped me to create and civilize the stories."<br>
<br>
Washington and company members (who include her husband, executive director Erwin Washington, and her daughter, critically acclaimed dancer Tamica Washington) have been working on the piece in their Los Angeles studio, but many of their ideas, and even some of their movements, have been culled from school and public workshops.<br>
<br>
"Lula has been interviewing community groups of all sorts to help her form this piece," says Martin Wollesen, director of Arts &amp; Lectures at UCSC. "In our area she visited high schools in Santa Cruz and San Jose with some of her dancers. They interviewed the students about their dreams and aspirations for the new millennium and had them create their own dance piece based on how they saw themselves." (The Santa Cruz- and San Jose-area outreach was made possible by support from UCSC's Outreach, Admissions, and Student Academic Services program.)<br>
<br>
When it comes to bringing arts into the community, Arts &amp; Lectures and the Lula Washington Dance Theatre share the same vision. "We are interested in bringing arts to students of all ages in the community, many of whom may ultimately wind up attending UCSC," Wollesen explains. Many of Arts &amp; Lectures' featured performers and speakers conduct workshops during their stay in Santa Cruz, working with everyone from UCSC students to kindergartners to the general public.<br>
<br>
As well known as the company is for performance, the Lula Washington Dance Theatre is also renowned for its outreach activity. Washington's company supports youth ensembles, and company members also teach after-school and weekend classes to low-income children. The troupe also performs in public schools in L.A. and across the country, and a program Washington established in 1983, "I Do Dance Not Drugs," continues to help redirect at-risk youth.<br>
<br>
"I like kids," Washington says. "I have a lot of fun with them. I feel like you can learn from anybody. I started very late and wanted to be part of something that would give back to kids at a younger age. There are not enough professional dancers who enjoy working with younger kids and to bring that enrichment to their lives makes such a difference."<br>
<br>
"We're hoping that the outreach will motivate the kids to want to come and see the show and seek out dance as an alternative way of using their time and energy and a way of exploring the possibilities of telling their own stories."<br>
<br>
Washington didn't begin her dance career until she was 22 (and then, only after actively lobbying the UCLA dance department to admit her, despite her age). But, because of her teaching efforts, many other promising dancers have been able to begin their careers at a much younger age, and former students have gone on to perform with Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, Donald Byrd Dance Theatre, Dance Theatre of Harlem, and on Broadway.<br>
<br>
Along with the performance, the troupe will conduct a master class with UCSC dance students as well as a community workshop. For workshop information, call (831) 459-3861. For tickets to the performance, call (831) 459-2159.
