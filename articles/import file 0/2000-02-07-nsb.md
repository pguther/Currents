  As chair of the National Science Board's Committee on Communication and Outreach, Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood played a leading role in a recent symposium on "Communicating Science and Technology in the Public Interest." Leaders of public affairs, news media, and information technology organizations shared their views at the symposium, organized by the National Science Board and held at the Beckman Center in Irvine on February 2 and 3. The symposium generated a serious discussion on the current environment for science and engineering communications; public attitudes and the role of the media; the impact of new information technologies; and effective science and engineering communication and outreach practices. The discussions will help shape the future direction of <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/nsb/start.htm">National Science Board</a> and National Science Foundation activities in communicating science, engineering, and technology. The National Science Board is the governing body for the National Science Foundation and also serves as national science policy adviser to the President and the Congress.
