  <font color="#003399">Public hearing on the Draft EIR on relocation of the modular student housing complex</font>
</h4>
<p>
  <font color="#000000">A public hearing on the Draft EIR on the relocation of the modular student housing complex (the Village) will be held on Friday, March 10, from 6 to 8 p.m. at the Barn Theater. The proposed project would relocate 17 modular housing units and 2 support units from the north campus--where Colleges Nine and Ten residence halls will be built--to the Lower Quarry. The relocated modular housing units would provide bed spaces for approximately 153 students. The project also includes the installation of an additional modular support unit, the construction of a storage shed, and the relocation of the modular Agroecology Office/lab complex from the northern part of the Lower Quarry to the southern part of the Lower Quarry.<br>
  <br>
  At the public hearing, campus planners will provide a description of the project and its environmental effects, and members of the public will be invited to give oral comments on the Draft EIR for the project. Call Christine Aldecoa at (831) 459-4407 for additional information or to request accommodations for persons with disabilities.</font>

</h4>
<p>
  Fredric Lieberman, professor of ethnomusicology, and Mickey Hart, rhythm maestro and pulse behind the Grateful Dead, will appear at Bookshop Santa Cruz on Thursday, March 9, at 7:30 p.m. to celebrate their new book <i>Spirit into Sound: The Magic of Music.</i> The book is a collection of quotes and thoughts on the power of music that spans millennia and mindsets--featuring everyone from Ayatollah Khomeini to Gustav Mahler to Janis Joplin to Plato, who says, "Music training is a more potent instrument than any other, because rhythm and harmony find their way into the secret places of the soul." This is the third book Lieberman and Hart have coauthored. Bookshop Santa Cruz is located in downtown Santa Cruz at 1520 Pacific Ave. For more information on the book signing, call (831) 423-0900.
