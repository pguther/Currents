  Transportation and Parking Services With construction on and off campus creating traffic congestion and the Core West Parking Structure still four months from completion, Transportation and Parking Services (TAPS) is stepping up its efforts to mitigate these impacts with new and expanded programs. "Not only is TAPS focusing on the short-term parking and transportation needs of the campus," said Wes Scott, TAPS director, "but we're developing innovative commute-alternative programs that are vital for the future of the campus and the community." In response to the anticipated parking crunch this fall, TAPS and the Santa Cruz Seaside Company are providing a free park-and-ride lot near the Boardwalk for UCSC faculty, staff, and students. Two hundred parking spaces will be available weekdays between 7 a.m. and 10:30 p.m. To get people between the lot and campus, TAPS is providing free shuttle service during the morning and afternoon commute hours. Those using the lot must display a parking permit that can be obtained at no cost through the TAPS Sales Office. To replace parking spaces lost to construction in the Science Hill area, the North Remote parking lot has been designated for "A" and "B" parking only, and attendant-assisted parking in the lot will add 25 spaces to the 70-space lot. People who don't want to make the short walk between the lot and Science Hill may ride a TAPS shuttle, which is providing service at 20-minute intervals between 7:30 a.m. and 6 p.m. weekdays. After 6 p.m., the Express Night Core will drop off passengers at the lot on request. "TAPS programs will be in full swing this fall," said Scott. "We're expanding some of our most popular ones." TAPS newest program, the Bike Trailer, has proven so popular that a second trailer has been added to the weekday service. In mid-September, the Bike Trailer began operating at 15-minute intervals between 6:45 and 10 a.m. Cyclists can catch a ride with their bicycle from the Marcelo's Restaurant parking lot at Mission and Bay. Then, passengers can unload bikes at the Physical Plant Metro stop, at Cowell Circle, and at the Baskin Engineering loading dock. Fourteen bikes can be carried on each run. In October, TAPS will begin operating two new commuter vanpools. These new vans, supported by a grant from the Monterey Bay Unified Air Pollution Control District, are the campus's first compressed natural gas vehicles. The commuter vanpools will serve the Aptos/Soquel and the Live Oak/Eastside Santa Cruz areas. These vanpools will cost $17.50 per month, one-third the monthly rate of an "A" parking permit. In addition to the new TAPS offerings, UCSC continues to offer bus service. During the academic year, Santa Cruz Metro operates numerous direct and express transit services to UCSC. The areas served include West and East Santa Cruz, Watsonville, and the San Lorenzo Valley. These transit services--and all other Metro routes in Santa Cruz County--are free to UCSC faculty, staff, and students. Free bus passes are available through the TAPS Sales Office. In addition, October 2-6 is California Rideshare Week. Now in its 18th year, this statewide promotion encourages commuters to improve traffic congestion, reduce air pollution, and decrease parking demand by carpooling, bicycling, vanpooling, riding the bus, or walking. "This is a great time to try alternatives," said Scott. "UCSC's commute programs are low cost or free, and people may find they really like them." People who pledge to use a transportation alternative during California Rideshare Week become eligible for prizes that include a trip around the world.
