<p>
  The American Cancer Society has awarded a $50,000 postdoctoral fellowship to Yael Mandel-Gutfreund to support her research in the lab of assistant professor of chemistry and biochemistry Lydia Gregoret. Mandel-Gutfreund's research involves characterizing the proteins that bind to RNA and DNA, which is important to understanding how the genetic machinery of cells works and what components may fail in diseases such as cancer.
