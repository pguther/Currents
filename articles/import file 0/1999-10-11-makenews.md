  During a summer visit to Australia, linguist <b>Geoffrey Pullum</b> was interviewed for two 15-minute nationally broadcast radio talks for ABC Radio National--one on why "bad" dialect doesn't make you a bad person but bad spelling does (at least if you're a sign-maker), and the other on what rule of word formation the Toni Braxton song <i>Un-break My Heart</i> violates in lines like "un-cry these tears." Pullum has done six such radio talks in Australia now, all as part of a regular program called <i>Lingua Franca,</i> which is devoted to language issues (<a href="http://ling.ucsc.edu/~pullum/locker/radiotalks.html">transcripts of the shows)</a>.
