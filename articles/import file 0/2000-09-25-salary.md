  Many university employees will enjoy slightly bigger paychecks November 1, when a systemwide salary augmentation program kicks in.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The University of California received a special one-time allotment of $19 million in the state budget to increase salaries of lower-paid employees. The augmentation, as well as regular annual merit increases for employees who are not represented by unions, takes effect October 1 and will appear in November paychecks.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "This is good news," said Willeen McQuitta, director of staff human resources at UCSC. "The university is recognizing that lower-paid staff, particularly, deserve an across-the-board salary boost, in addition to the merit increases."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Eligible employees who earn $40,000 or less will receive an additional 2 percent salary increase. Those who earn between $40,000 and $80,000 will receive a 1 percent salary increase. All nonrepresented clerical employees will receive a 2 percent salary increase, regardless of their current salary. These increases will be applied to salaries before annual merit increases are calculated.<br>
</p>
<p>
  In addition, nonrepresented clerical staff who receive a performance rating of "met expectations" or better will receive an additional 1 percent after the merit process.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Increases for union-represented employees must be negotiated before they can be implemented, and talks are under way between the university and union representatives, said McQuitta.
