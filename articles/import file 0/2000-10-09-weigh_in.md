<p>
  This week we're launching a new feature: <b>Weigh In and Win!.</b><br>
  <br>
  <b>Tell us what you think:</b> Each week, you will have the chance to give your opinion on a topic in the news, of general interest, or something just for fun. You may respond with simply a "yes," "no," or "unsure." Or you may elaborate on your response. The following week, the tally of yes's, no's, and unsures will be provided, along with a sampling of the narrative responses. Responses will appear without author names.
</p>
<p>
  <b>Win a handsome Currents coffee mug:</b> Five names will be drawn at random each week from all the respondents to win a mug. In order to receive a mug, participants must be UCSC staff, faculty, or students, and they must submit their name and campus e-mail address on the response form. Only one mug per person, please. Winners' names will be listed the following week.
