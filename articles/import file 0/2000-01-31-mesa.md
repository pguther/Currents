  The MESA Engineering Program at UCSC has received a grant of $8,000 from Pacific Bell as part of an effort by MESA and Pacific Bell to bridge the "digital divide." The partnership is assisting educationally disadvantaged students to attain engineering and computer science degrees. The grant, designed to help further develop the MESA Engineering Program's board and to improve the academic advising within the program, is one of several grants from Pacific Bell to MESA programs throughout California. <a href="http://natsci.ucsc.edu/Acad/Mesa/Main/main.htm">MESA</a>, which stands for Mathematics, Engineering, Science Achievement, is a statewide program administered by UC that assists more than 22,000 educationally disadvantaged students to succeed academically in math and science. "Working with MESA is a form of enlightened self-interest," said David Morse, vice president of Pacific Bell's Billing Products Organization. "The MESA Engineering Program is a richly producing educational model designed to meet the special requirements of disadvantaged students who want to excel in the math- or science-based fields. These students will make great customers and great employees for Pacific Bell. It's a win-win situation for all involved," Morse said. The MESA Engineering Program is a partnership between MESA and four-year institutions including campuses of the University of California and the California State University, as well as private universities. The program supports students at these institutions to successfully attain degrees in engineering or computer science.
