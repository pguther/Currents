<p>
  The parking-structure project planned for the Science Hill area of campus cleared a hurdle in September when campus and Santa Cruz officials signed an agreement that includes a promise from the city not to sue to stop construction.
</p>
<p>
  The campus, in return, agreed to contribute $250,000 toward the mutual development of a transportation master plan for Santa Cruz; the city is contributing the same amount. The campus also agreed not to pursue in the near future the idea of an eastern access route that would connect the campus to Highway 9.
</p>
<p>
  Speaking in the office of Assembly Speaker pro Tem Fred Keeley, who facilitated discussions between the two sides, Chancellor Greenwood said the agreement ushers in a "new era of cooperation between the university and the city."
</p>
<p>
  The parking structure is expected to be completed a year from now.
