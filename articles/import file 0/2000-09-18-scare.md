<p>
  Brush the cobwebs off your creativity and create a seasonal sensation for the first-ever scarecrow contest that's being held in conjunction with the UCSC Farm's annual Harvest Festival on October 14.
</p><br>
The contest is open to the public, and the Center for Agroecology is extending a special invitation to UCSC staff, faculty, and students to create scarecrows that will be a centerpiece of the festival. Entries by individuals and teams of up to four campus members are encouraged.
<p>
  The annual Harvest Festival is a family-oriented event that features live music, events for children, food, gardening workshops, and an apple tasting of heirloom varieties.<br>
  <br>
  The scarecrow contest will begin at noon and will be judged by a panel of campus faculty and community members. Winners will be announced at 1 p.m.<br>
  <br>
  Everyone who enters the contest will receive free admission to the festival. Prizes will be awarded as follows to each creator or member of a winning team: First prize is a Farm &amp; Garden T-shirt and a box of mixed fruits and vegetables; second prize is a box of mixed fruits and vegetables; third prize is a bouquet of fresh-cut flowers and a Farm &amp; Garden coffee mug.<br>
  <br>
  Pre-entry registration is required by calling John Fisher at 459-3248 or sending<br>
  him e-mail at <a href="mailto:johnfish@cats.ucsc.edu">johnfish@cats.ucsc.edu</a>.<br>
  <br>
  All scarecrows must be dropped off at the UCSC Farm's back gate by 5:30 p.m. on October 13. Please be sure to attach a list of the name of each team member.<br>
  <br>
  The height of each scarecrow should not exceed seven feet, six inches, nor should it be less than five feet.<br>
  <br>
  For display purposes, please build your scarecrow on a pole and leave at least two feet below so the scarecrow can be freestanding after it is set in the ground.<br>
  <br>
  Near the end of the festival you may take your scarecrow home or donate it<br>
  to the Farm.<br>
