  Eileen L. Brooks, assistant professor of economics at the University of California, Santa Cruz, died Wednesday, February 1, at Dominican Hospital after a lengthy battle with cancer. She was 33 years old. No services are planned.

A 1994 graduate of Massachusetts Institute of Technology, she earned an M.Litt. from Oxford University in international relations in 1996.
</p>
<p>
  At UCSC, Brooks taught courses in international trade, international economics, and advanced quantitative methods. An affiliate of College Nine, she was a member of the Santa Cruz Center for International Economics (SCCIE) and served as seminar coordinator for the center last year. She was also a member of the Economics Department's International Trade Search Committee and the Computer Committee. In 2004, Brooks organized the 11th Annual Empirical Investigations in International Trade meeting.

  In addition to her academic work, Brooks was a short-term policy consultant for the World Bank in 1997 and neural networks intern for State Street Bank in 1998.
</p>
<p>
