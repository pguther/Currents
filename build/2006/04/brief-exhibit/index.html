  A traveling exhibit, "Interrupted Life: Incarcerated Mothers in the United States," is on display through April 24 at the <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/wmcenter/">UCSC Women's Center</a> and the Porter College Faculty Gallery.
</p>
<p>
  The largest work at the Women's Center, titled "Centerpiece," is a series of collages, each made up of images women in prison created in response to the question What does it mean to be a mother? Using words and photographs from newspapers and magazines as well as original drawings and lettering, these pieces tell a poignant story of love, loss, guilt, and the pain of separation.
</p>
<p>
  The show, curated by historian Rickie Solinger, opened in March at the California Women's Facility at Chino and will travel around the country for the next three years.
</p>
<p>
  On Tuesday, April 11, there will be a talk by community studies professor Nancy Stoller followed by a panel discussion with representatives from Inside Out Writing Project, Justice Now, Friends Outside, Gemma, Critical Resistance, Legal Services for Prisoners with Children, and the ACLU Drug Law Reform Project. The program is from 7 to 9 p.m. at the Women's Center and is preceded by a reception beginning at 6:30 p.m. The event is free and open to the public.
</p>
<p>
  On Thursday, April 20, there will be a free public workshop on the work of the group Critical Resistance. The mission of the group is to end the prison industrial complex. Beginning with a 6:30 p.m. reception, the workshop will run from 7 to 9 p.m. at the Women's Center.
</p>
<p>
  The Women's Center is located in the Cardiff House on campus and is open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday. The Porter College Faculty Gallery is located in building D222 and is open from noon to 5 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday. For more information, contact Roberta Valdez, director of the UCSC Women's Center at (831) 459-2169.
</p>
<p>
  "Interrupted Life" is sponsored by the UCSC Women's Center in collaboration with Porter College and the ACLU-Santa Cruz Chapter.
