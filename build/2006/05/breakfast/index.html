<p>
  Stevenson Event Center took on a festive air Wednesday as a crowd of 1,200 sampled strawberries, scones, and scrambled eggs at the annual Staff Appreciation Breakfast.
</p>
<p>
  Chancellor Denton formally welcomed staff members to the gathering and thanked the Staff Advisory Board, which cosponsors the event with the Chancellor's Office.
</p>
<p>
  Denton also cited the extra efforts of Dining Services workers, who got up early to produce the bountiful breakfast buffet.
</p>
<p>
  The ingedients for the breakfast included 25 flats of strawberries, 325 pounds of potatoes, 160 pounds of eggs, 1,584 pancakes, 2,100 pieces of bacon, and 102 gallons of coffee.
</p>
<p>
  From the reactions of the crowd, their hard work did not go unnoticed.
</p>
<p>
  "Cooking eggs for the masses can be hard. These were really good," said June Taylor, Academic Human Resouces coordinator for the School of Engineering.
</p>
<p>
  "The strawberries were incredible," said Joyce Smith, a payroll assistant in Academic Human Resources. "Those were the best I've had this season. I'm thinking of going back in for more."
</p>
<p>
  Drawings for prizes every half hour and music by a student jazz trio added to the celebratory mood.
</p>
<p>
  Ed Titus of the Staff Advisory Board said the breakfast is the Staff Advisory Board's most popular event. "I've only gotten positive feedback from staff," he said. "When we first started it five years ago, we only had about 800. Every year, it gets a little larger."
</p>
<p>
  There was a sad note to this year's breakfast, though. The crowd went quiet briefly after staff member David Silva-Espinoza asked for a moment of silence to honor <a href="http://currents.ucsc.edu/05-06/05-15/memorial.asp">Mary Melville</a> of Financial Administrative Services and Transactions, who died in an automobile accident May 6.
