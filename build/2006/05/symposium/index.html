  UCSC's University Center became a sea of research Friday as more than 100 graduate students shared their work with curious townspeople and members of the campus community.
</p>
<p>
  The occasion was the Graduate Research Symposium, featuring oral and computer presentations as well as detailed posters by more than 100 graduate students.
</p>
<p>
  "It's great to see the students sharing their excitement about their research," said Lisa Sloan, vice provost and dean of Graduate Studies. "I'm also very pleased that this year we had visitors from town come to experience what our graduate students are doing."
</p>
<p>
  Irma and Peter Andrews of Aptos were impressed with how well the students explained their research to a wide audience.
</p>
<p>
  "It's good to get a picture of what they're doing," said Irma Andrews, a retired math teacher. "The variety of subjects surprised me."
</p>
<p>
  "A lot of them were fascinating," said Peter Andrews, a retired accountant. The couple said they found anthopology student Rosa E. Ficek's research on the Pan American Highway especially interesting because they had traveled the highway themselves.
</p>
<p>
  Now in its second year, the Graduate Research Symposium is designed to recognize and promote the outstanding and diverse research being carried out by graduate students from all disciplines. A list of the student presentations at the symposium is available <a href="http://graddiv.ucsc.edu/news_and_events/view_news.php?id=39">online.</a>
