<p>
  The Philosophy Department and Stevenson College will present a lecture by renowned Australian philosopher and ethicist Peter Singer on Thursday, May 11, at 4 p.m. in UCSC's Quarry Amphitheater.
</p>
<p>
  Singer will speak about his new book: <i>The Way We Eat: Why Our Food Choices Matter</i> (Rodale Books; May, 2006). Admission is free and open to the public.
</p>
<p>
  The author of <i>Animal Liberation</i> and coauthor of <i>Animal Factories</i>, Singer was named by <i>Time</i> magazine last year as one of 2005's "100 Most Influential People." He is often described as the world's leading ethicist, and <i>The New Yorker</i> once wrote that Singer "may be the most controversial philosopher alive." His theories have set off passionate debates that have been reflected today in arguments about abortion, stem-cell research, and euthanasia.
</p>
<p>
  A professor of bioethics at Princeton University, Singer was the founding president of the International Association of Bioethics, and founding coeditor of the journal <i>Bioethics</i>. His works have appeared in 20 languages, and Singer is the author of the major article on ethics in the current edition of the <i>Encyclopedia Britannica</i>.
</p>
<p>
  The <i>Economist</i> noted that "Singer's influence extends to the world beyond the ivory tower partly because he writes with such lucidity and quiet passion about genuinely pressing questions." And the <i>New York Times Book Review</i> noted that "No other living philosopher has had this kind of influence."
</p>
<p>
  The event is cosponsored by KUSP, the Environmental Studies Department, and the Forum on the Environment--a new venture at UCSC initiated by Victoria Kamsler, a visiting professor this spring in the Philosophy Department from the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J.
</p>
<p>
  "The Forum will be videoconferencing in distinguished experts from around the world on environmental subjects," Kamsler noted. "It will meet weekly, and a local faculty member will act as interlocutor with our videoconferenced guests, who will take questions from our audience. The Forum will be podcast, and it has been designated as a pilot project for Media Services Webcasting," she added.
</p>
<p>
  Parking is available at the East Remote Parking Lot for $5 with a free shuttle to the event. For more information, call (831) 426-1774, <a href="mailto:vkamsler@ucsc.edu">vkamsler@ucsc.edu</a>.
