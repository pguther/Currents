<p>
  Whether you're an apple aficionado or a pumpkin devotee, the annual Harvest Festival at UCSC is a fun and festive way to celebrate the changing of the seasons.
</p>
<p>
  With live music, hayrides, farm tours, crafts for the kids, and a gardening workshop, there will be something for everyone at the UCSC Farm on Saturday, October 7, from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.
</p>
<p>
  Admission is free for kids 12 and under and for members of the Friends of the UCSC Farm &amp; Garden; adult admission is $5; UCSC students pay $3 with ID.
</p>
<p>
  Three bands will provide live music throughout the day, while youngsters will enjoy storytelling, face-painting, and pressing apples to make fresh juice. The annual apple tasting is a crowd pleaser, as are the cooking demonstration and an herb walk led by local herbalist and acupuncturist Darren Huckle. As always, campus and community groups will have booths set up for browsing, and a number of local farmers will be selling their produce as part of the "Buy Fresh, Buy Local" campaign. See below for the full schedule of events.
</p>
<p>
  Bakers will want to note that prizes in the fifth annual Apple Pie Bake-Off (see below for entry rules) include wine from Bonny Doon Winery, a gift certificate to Gabriella Cafe, a gift certificate to Spa Fitness, and cookbooks and rose care books from the Friends of the Farm &amp; Garden. Also new this year is a bread making workshop and demonstration.
</p>
<p>
  The Harvest Festival is sponsored by the UCSC Center for Agroecology &amp; Sustainable Food Systems; proceeds benefit the Friends of the UCSC Farm &amp; Garden. Major business sponsors include New Leaf Community Markets; Stonyfield Farm, through their Profits for the Planet Fund; Christiansen Associates Organic Gardens &amp; Design; the UCSC Food Systems Working Group; and Jacob's Farm/Del Cabo.
