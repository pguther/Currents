<p>
  A distinguished group of writers, editors, and critics will converge on the UCSC campus November 10 and 11 for a bilingual conference on Latino literature, "Latino Literature/La Literatura Latina: Writing, Publishing, Reading."
</p>
<p>
  In addition to a series of academic panels, the conference will feature eight nationally recognized writers who will read from their works in two evening sessions titled "Latina/o Writers Read." Admission is free and the public is encouraged to attend.
</p>
<p>
  "It is rare to find a conference about Latino literature of this magnitude," noted associate professor of literature Juan Poblete, who organized the event along with his colleagues in the UCSC Literature Department, professor Norma Klahn and associate professor Kirsten Silva Gruesz. "This is not something that happens on a regular basis for the Latino community or for those who are interested in Latino literature."
</p>
<p>
  "In fact you don't find many conferences on Latino literature at all in the U.S.," Poblete added. "It's usually just a small part of conferences on minority literature featuring one or two Latino writers."
</p>
<p>
  Poblete said that the conference was organized to explore the variety and diversity of Latino literature, noting that it is an umbrella term covering writing that spans a broad range of possibilities--from Spanish to English with all the hybrids in between, such as Spanglish. "We don't want to homogenize Latino literature or obscure that there are multiple projects and a wide spectrum of writers that fall under that heading," he explained.
</p>
<p>
  Poblete added that the conference will also include the participation of editors and booksellers.
</p>
<p>
  "We have a full panel on Saturday morning about the process of publishing and circulation," said Poblete. "We will discuss questions such as: What makes a book Latino? What gets published and distributed? What are the constraints that publishing companies and nonprofits are faced with when trying to publish Latino literature?"
</p>
<p>
  Another panel will talk about the audiences for Latino literature, discussing the possibilities of opening up the perception of the genre from just fiction to other forms of writing such as nonfiction, screenwriting, radio, and television writing. Panelists will also examine the history of Latino literature in the U.S. "There is a long tradition of Latino writing that goes against the popular perception that it is the 'new kid on the block,'" noted Poblete.
</p>
<p>
  Guest writers and panelists at the conference will include:
</p>
<p>
  <strong>* Francisco Goldman</strong>, author of three award-winning novels, <i>The Long Night of White Chickens</i>, <i>The Ordinary Seaman,</i> and recently, <i>The Divine Husband</i>.

A graduate of UC Santa Cruz, Grande was named a PEN Center USA Emerging Voices Rosenthal Fellow in 2003.
