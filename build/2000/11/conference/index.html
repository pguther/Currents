  <h1>UCSC hosts statewide conference for beginning teachers</h1>

  
  <p class="date">Jennifer McNulty</p>
  

  <p>
  For the first time, beginning teachers from across the state have the opportunity to meet for a daylong professional conference that will offer tips on issues such as classroom management, curriculum development, student assessment, and technology, all in the context of recognizing and celebrating the contributions new teachers make to schools.
</p>
<p>
  UCSC's New Teacher Center is inviting all new teachers in California to attend the gathering, "In Celebration of New Teachers: The Key to the Future," on Saturday, November 18, at the San Mateo Marriott Hotel in San Mateo. Cost is $85 per person, which includes two meals, refreshments, and entry to all sessions and the postconference reception. Space is limited, and advance registration is required; no on-site registration will be available. Register on the web at <a href="http://www.newteachercenter.org/btc.html">www.newteachercenter.org/btc.html</a>, or call Peggy Young at (831) 459-4323 or (831) 454-9749 for more information.<br />
</p>
<p>
  Keynote addresses will be delivered by Crystal A. Kuykendall and Ellen Moir. Kuykendall, whose talk is titled, "The Key to Bringing Out the Best in All Students," is an expert on student motivation, equality and equity in education, and teacher behaviors that support the achievement of all students. She began her career as a classroom teacher and has held positions as a university instructor, executive director of the National Alliance of Black School Educators, and director of urban and minority relations for the National School Boards Association. She was appointed by President Jimmy Carter as chairperson of the National Advisory Council on Continuing Education and is the author of four books, including <i>From Rage to Hope: Strategies for Reclaiming Black and Hispanic Students.</i><br />
</p>
<p>
  Moir is the executive director of the New Teacher Center at UC Santa Cruz. "Luckily, we are starting to recognize that great teachers are not born but developed over time," said Moir. "There's a lot we can do to facilitate that development, and we need to recognize that good teachers need time, careful training, and ongoing support to become the mentors for the next generation of beginning teachers."<br />
</p>
<p>
  During the conference, more than two dozen concurrent professional development sessions will address the needs and interests of teachers at the elementary and secondary levels. Topics will include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>enhancing the classroom environment
  </li>
  <li>increasing parental involvement
  </li>
  <li>making algebra accessible
  </li>
  <li>integrating science and language development for English language learners
  </li>
  <li>narrowing the literacy gap for secondary students
  </li>
  <li>intervention strategies that build resiliency in students
  </li>
  <li>bringing history and social science to life
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The day will end with a closing celebration and a reception with entertainment. For a full schedule of events, visit the conference web site at <a href="http://www.newteachercenter.org/btc.html">www.newteachercenter.org/btc.html</a>.<br />
