  W. Jackson Davis, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, has been appointed to serve on the selection committee for the recently established <a href="http://www.heyerdahlaward.com/">Thor Heyerdahl International Maritime Environmental Award</a>. He will be in distinguished company on the committee, with fellow members including Prince Philip of Great Britain, Mikhail Gorbachev, and International Red Cross president Astrid Heiberg.<br />
  <br />
  Davis has been a United Nations representative and negotiator in the area of international environmental issues for the past 15 years, serving as a consultant to Pacific Island countries and the UN Alliance of Small Island States. He has been involved in negotiating international treaties and conventions on the oceans, the climate, and biodiversity.

  The Heyerdahl Award was established in 1999 by <a href="http://www.heyerdahlaward.com/aboutheyerdahl/">Thor Heyerdahl</a> and the Norwegian Shipowners' Association. The award is intended to inspire the worldwide maritime community to strive to improve the global environment. It will be presented for the first time in May 2001 at an international shipping conference in Oslo. The award consists of a statuette, a diploma, and a $100,000 prize.
