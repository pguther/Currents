  UC Santa Cruz received $24.3 million in private support during the fiscal year that ended June 30, according to the campus's Development Office. The support includes $6 million from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute. The fiscal year 1999-2000 marked the fourth consecutive year the campus has received record-breaking levels of private gift support. "The sustained increase in private philanthropic support is testimony to the continued excellence of UCSC's programs in the arts, engineering, humanities, and natural and social sciences," said Chancellor Greenwood. "In particular, recognition from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, in the form of two investigator appointments, lifts the campus to an entirely new level in regard to biomedical and engineering research." David Haussler, professor of computer science and director of the Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering, was selected as a full investigator for the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI), and Yishi Jin, assistant professor of biology, was selected as an assistant investigator. The two are among 48 scientists selected nationwide for the prestigious appointments. With the addition of the HHMI awards, this year's fundraising total at UCSC was 31 percent more than that received the previous year, when nearly $18.5 million was contributed to campus programs, scholarships, and fellowships. In addition to major gifts, UC Santa Cruz receives gifts from many individual donors who provide significant support to the campus annually. Campus supporters gave $1.4 million through UCSC's Annual Giving program this past year, with $1.1 million coming through the Telephone Outreach Program. These donors are primarily alumni and parents, with matching funds from corporations. Trustees of the UC Santa Cruz Foundation, which supports UCSC through its private fundraising efforts, gave over $930,000 to the campus this past year. Ronald P. Suduiko, vice chancellor for University Relations, credited a number of sources for the fundraising achievements this past year. "Our success is due to the generosity and personal support of donors who include many alumni, parents, and friends of the university; the excellence of the university as exemplified by the work of our faculty, staff, and students; and the commitment of our University Relations team," he said. The bulk of the funding this past year came from the following sources: foundations, 32 percent; individuals, 26 percent; and the business sector, 11 percent. Other sources included institutions and community and campus organizations, totaling 31 percent. Major private gifts or grants received by UCSC during the past year included:
