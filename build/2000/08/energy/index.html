<p>
  Most of us are familiar with conserving water. But there's a new kind of drought in California, calling for a new method of conservation.
</p>
<p>A drought of electricity has hit the western states, and it’s expected to last through 2001, said Bob Dunn, campus energy manager at Physical Plant.<br />
<br />
“There’s a shortage of capacity on peak days,” said Dunn. “The power plants just can’t make enough energy to meet demand.”<br />
<br />
Several factors contribute to the energy shortage. The state’s strong economic growth and the deregulation of the power industry both play a role. In addition, few power plants have been built in the past decade. Many are now planned, but the lengthy approval and construction process means that most will not be operating before 2002.<br />
<br />
The shortage of capacity is felt most often during the summer months, when people turn on air conditioners to ward off the heat.<br />
<br />
Several heat waves this summer have pushed demand for power to emergency levels. In June, the <a href="http://www.caiso.com">California Independent System Operator</a> (CAISO), which manages the state’s electric grid, ordered rotating block outages in portions of the Bay Area because of extreme heat conditions and limited resources.<br />
<br />
Similar curtailment has occurred in southern California more recently–and more often.<br />
<br />
The block outages are necessary in order to maintain electric service to customers that provide essential public safety services, such as hospitals and fire stations, according to <a href="http://www.pge.com/all.html">Pacific Gas and Electric Company</a>.<br />
<br />
In general, the System Operator has asked that all Californians work harder to conserve energy.<br />
<br />
UCSC is taking a number of measures to voluntarily reduce its energy consumption, said Dunn. Physical Plant staff are experimenting with raising the thermostats on air conditioning units for the science buildings. The group is also developing additional strategies for energy savings, including a formal curtailment policy.<br />
<br />
“We already try to run as lean as we can,” said Dunn, “and it’s hard to squeeze any more out.”<br />
<br />
In the meantime, faculty and staff can do a number of things to help reduce the campus’s energy consumption. The following are energy conservation tips from Pacific Gas and Electric:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Turn off PCs, monitors, printers, copiers, and lights every night, every weekend, and when they're not in use. If you can't turn off the whole computer, turn off the monitor and the printer.
  </li>
  <li>Clean dusty diffusers and lamps every 6-12 months for improved light output.
  </li>
  <li>Close shades or blinds during early morning and late evening to reduce solar insulation heat gain.
  </li>
  <li>Set thermostats at 78 degrees Fahrenheit for air conditioning and 68 degrees Fahrenheit for heating.
  </li>
  <li>When possible, use laptop computers--they consume 90 percent less energy than standard desktop computers.
  </li>
  <li>When possible, use ink-jet printers--they consume 90 percent less energy than laser printers.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  In addition, said Dunn, faculty and staff can help by:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>switching off unnecessary lighting in their offices
  </li>
  <li>turning off any personal electronic devices, such as coffee pots or hot plates, when they're not in use.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  These conservation measures may seem small, but collectively they can make a difference, said Dunn.<br />
  <br />
  "Any reduction in our use of electricity will help the situation," he said.<br />
  <br />
  The campus is the largest employer--and the largest energy user--in Santa Cruz County. The campus draws 6.5 megawatts during peak times, an amount equal to 0.4 percent of the power produced by the Moss Landing Power Plant.<br />
  <br />
  For its new construction, the campus has exceeded the state standard for energy conservation. It's also the lowest energy user of all nine UC campuses, but Santa Cruz's mild climate certainly plays a role in that distinction, said Dunn.<br />
  <br />
  If UCSC's power pipeline is cut during an electricity emergency, the campus's cogeneration plant--which produces half the power used by the campus--will continue to supply electricity to the natural sciences buildings where it is needed for laboratory experiments and for reasons of public safety, said Dunn. Administrative buildings, housing, and other academic buildings must rely on emergency generators.
