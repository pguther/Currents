<p>
  At lunchtime, staff member Barbara Cool Lee wraps up her work in the Kresge Faculty Services Center and heads out to her other office--the passenger seat of her '92 Toyota pickup. Once there, she opens her laptop computer and writes.
</p>
<p>Lee has completed two manuscripts this way in the past seven years. And, in April, she learned that her latest manuscript has earned her a spot as one of five finalists in the national “Golden Heart Awards” competition sponsored by the <a href="http://www.rwanational.com/golden_heart2.stm">Romance Writers of America</a>.</p>
<p>
  Lee's manuscript, titled "In Deep Water," is being considered in the "Romantic Suspense/Gothic" category for unpublished authors. The winner will be named at the organization's annual conference, which will be held in July in Washington, D.C.<br />
  <br />
  Lee heard the news with mixed feelings. "I was thrilled, but one of my first thoughts was, 'There's no way I can go,' " she recalls. "I didn't see how I could scrape together the money for airfare and hotels. But people in the business and friends were telling me that I couldn't miss this opportunity."<br />
  <br />
  While Lee tried to figure out how to finance her trip, a plot was hatched by colleagues Julie Brower and John Jordan to help her on her way. The two sent out a letter to some 50 faculty and staff asking for donations to help send Lee to Washington.<br />
  <br />
  Nearly 40 people responded, donating a total of $1,500--enough to cover the conference registration, airfare, hotel, and meals. "People were thrilled to contribute," says Brower, undergraduate adviser for the Literature Department. "We even had donations from people who were out of the country and one from a faculty member who no longer works here."<br />
  <br />
  "Barbara has been so helpful to so many people," says Jordan, a professor of literature and chair of the Literature Department. "She has a lot of computer expertise and many of us have projects we've taken to her. She is the one, locally, who bails us out. We're all in her debt and it was nice to have some way other than verbal thanks to acknowledge that. Plus, we all feel a lot of respect for someone who dedicates her life to writing, and were pleased to be able to support that work."<br />
  <br />
  The check was presented to Lee at a gathering in the Faculty Services Office in honor of her birthday. The unsuspecting Lee showed up expecting the usual cake and candles and instead got the surprise of her life. "I opened up the envelope and saw the check," she remembers. "I was shocked. I burst into tears."<br />
  <br />
  "When she opened the card," Brower says, "her eyes started to water. We got a chair under her right away. She was definitely looking weak in the knees."<br />
  <br />
  "I was so touched that so many people participated," Lee says, adding with a laugh, "Now I have the conference dates memorized because I am really going to go."<br />
  <br />
  As a finalist, Lee will have special opportunities to meet with publishers and agents. The honor gives her work credibility that is already prompting queries from editors.<br />
  <br />
  Lee's story is set on a lighthouse island based loosely on Point Sur. The main character is a woman who goes to the island to oversee a remodeling of the lighthouse. The woman has epilepsy and has lived a very sheltered life as a result. She decides to take on the lighthouse project as a way of establishing her independence. One night a wounded man washes ashore. He turns out to be a good guy, Lee says, but of course that's not immediately apparent. Lee describes him as a sweetheart, adding, "He's fictional, so he doesn't sit around drinking beer and watching television."
</p>
<p>
  Do the characters fall in love? "Of course!" Lee laughs.<br />
  <br />
  Lee wrote this manuscript on a laptop, but her previous manuscript, which has a similar setting and shares some storylines, was penned by hand. Lee, who has worked at the university since the mid-1980s, says she took a year's leave at one point to try and dedicate herself full-time to her writing. "I thought you needed to have large blocks of time to write. But you don't. It's like exercising, where you create this pattern. No matter what I'm doing at work, working on a database or whatever, I know that when I get in the passenger seat, I focus on my book. I go every day. On rainy days I take an umbrella and on sweltering days I roll down the window."<br />
  <br />
  Lee is already planning her next book, which she says has a "Sam Spade" feel to it. Like the others, it will have a level of suspense to it and, of course, a happy ending. But, as recent events have proved, romance fiction isn't the only place where happy endings occur.
