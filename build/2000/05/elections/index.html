  <h1>Undergraduates reject fee increases, elect new SUA officers</h1>

  Undergraduates rejected every initiative placed before them in the recent student election, while graduate students voted overwhelmingly to increase their fees to cover the costs of adding vision and dental insurance to their health coverage. (<a href="http://elections.ucsc.edu/elections/results2000.html">Complete election results</a>) Undergraduate turnout was 23.8 percent, and graduate turnout was 42.9 percent, for a combined campus turnout of 25.5 percent. All seven undergraduate initiatives were rejected by voters, including four OPERS-related proposals that would have increased student fees to fund additional physical education classes, intercollegiate athletics, recreation and intramural programs, and staffing and equipment. "It's difficult to get the two-thirds majority that's necessary to pass a ballot initiative," said John Holloway, executive director for student development and community service. "A number of measures got more than 50 percent, but they missed the two-thirds mark. For the second year in a row, undergraduates have rejected almost every proposed fee hike on the ballot." Holloway noted, however, that Measure H, which would have repealed a student fee that supports the student-run JunXion Pizza Co-op, also went down to defeat by a wide margin. Graduate students, on the other hand, approved Measures I and J to add vision and dental care to their health plans by margins of 86 to 14 percent, and 85 to 15 percent, respectively. The failure of Measure E, which would have increased student fees to support transportation on campus, has implications for the entire campus community, noted Wes Scott, director of Transportation and Parking Services (TAPS). "That means there will be less money for the shuttle system on campus," said Scott, who has continued to offer full shuttle service despite running at a deficit for two years. Students also rejected a proposal to create a new fee to cover the Student Union Assembly's (SUA) systemwide association fee, which is about $15,000 annually, said Holloway. Lauren Williams was elected chair of the SUA, while Jenny M. Jiang was elected UC Student Association representative for the campus. Matt Becker was elected campus office director of SUA, and Susie Vilayvanh was elected Lobby Corps director. The new officers will take their seats this fall, said Holloway. The results of the undergraduate opinion poll showed broad support for a proposal to move the Student Center to the location of the present Bay Tree Bookstore.

  Students also voiced support for discontinuing the campus's contract with Sodexho-Marriott Services because it is the leading financial investor in private-for-profit prisons, having the Student Regent selected by student representatives rather than by the UC Regents, adding a campuswide commencement ceremony on the East Field each June to the individual college ceremonies and receptions, and paying a $5 per quarter fee per student that would fund a free late-night ride service.<br />
  <br />
  Several items on the poll addressed the Narrative Evaluation System (NES) and proposed modifications to the existing system. Students expressed strong support for the current system.<br />
  <br />
  Opinion-poll topics are drafted by the SUA, Student Affairs, and Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs Francisco Hernandez, said Holloway. The results provide a "cross-section" of student opinion on subjects of interest to the campus community, he said.<br />
