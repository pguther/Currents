<p>
  A new map of UCSC, illustrating the campus with unprecedented clarity, made its debut at last month's Banana Slug Spring Fair. The new campus map differs from its predecessors in several important ways: It is detailed enough to show all paved pedestrian and bike paths, it shows the topography of the campus, and it has been produced in color.<br />
  <br />
</p>
<p>The poster-size map was created by cartographer Cherie Northon, using existing maps, aerial photos, and fieldwork to check for accuracy.<br />
<br />
The map, the first of a new series of UCSC maps, was produced under the direction of a campus committee headed by Susan Willats of the Office of Planning and Analysis.</p>
<p>
  Work on the new maps commenced two years ago, Willats said. "I'd been wanting to create an accessibility map of the campus since I started working here in 1986," she said. "But there was no accurate base map with sufficient detail to start with."
</p>
<p>
  So Willats approached Tom Vani, vice chancellor of Business and Administrative Services, with a request to create a new campus map; Vani gave Willats the go-ahead. "The timing of my request was good because several members of the senior administration were relatively new to the campus, and they had experienced difficulty finding their way around campus," said Willats.<br />
  <br />
  Willats's map committee comprised staff from many of the campus units that use maps as part of their operations. Representatives from Housing, the Conference Office, University Events, Public Affairs, Transportation and Parking Services (TAPS), Physical Planning and Construction, and Printing Services met periodically to define and redefine the scope of the map project. Committee members also considered funding options and provided feedback on various draft versions of the campus map. Initial funding was provided by Housing, TAPS, Admissions, Public Information, and University Relations. The Division of Social Sciences and the Arboretum have provided subsequent funding.<br />
  <br />
  In addition to the initial poster version of the campus map, there will also be a folded version with locator maps for all off-campus sites (including Long Marine Lab, Lick Observatory, the MBEST Center, and all UNEX locations). In addition, there will be new "cluster" maps of all residential areas, a parking map, black-and-white maps in two sizes, and a Web version of the campus map. Work on these maps is continuing and is expected to be completed by December.<br />
  <br />
  The maps are now available at the <a href="http://www.bookstore.ucsc.edu/">Bay Tree Bookstore</a> for $8.95 each; campus units get a 10 percent discount.
