</p>
<p>
  UCSC Extension's English Language Institute has welcomed to Santa Cruz a group of 25 Egyptian educators in a 20-day global training program focused on the methodology and curriculum development of English for Specific Purposes.
</p>
<p>
  The program, which started July 3, will continue until July 28 at UCSC Extension's University Town Center location in downtown Santa Cruz.
</p>
<p>
  The general goal of the English for Specific Purposes (ESP) program--focusing on English for academic purposes--is to produce a cadre of skilled and knowledgeable ESP teachers and trainers. These people will implement training approaches and teaching methodologies for other teachers and trainers and develop educational programs and curriculum tailored to Egyptian educational institutions.
</p>
<p>
  Participating in the ESP training workshop are English teachers from universities and institutes throughout Egypt who will be completing a three-part program. The program includes a one week pre-departure workshop in Cairo, a four-week training in Santa Cruz implemented by UCSC Extension, and a two-week follow-up training with ESP teachers in Cairo.<br />
  <br />
  "This is a very exciting and rewarding program for us to be working with a group of individuals who not only are determined to gain a good foundation of what is good teaching but decide what approaches are best adapted and sustained in their particular learning and cultural environment," said Susan Miller, director of the English Language Institute.<br />
  <br />
  UCSC Extension has a long tradition of offering top quality continuing education programs with over 3,000 courses annually and 55,000 enrollments. It is the premier provider of professional development programs with six classroom centers in Silicon Valley and the Central Coast.
</p>
<p>
  UCSC Extension's International Programs include language and cultural enhancement as well as specialized contract training programs for groups from around the world. The University Town Center, where the ESP Course Design and Materials Development for ESP Trainers Program is held, offers fully equipped state-of the-art classrooms, a computer laboratory with Internet access, and administrative offices.
</p>
<p>
  The English for Specific Purposes program is funded by USAID and administered through the Institute of International Education, AMIDEAST and the Career Development Center in Cairo.<br />
