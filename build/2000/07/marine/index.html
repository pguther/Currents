<p>
  A variety of fun and informative programs are available on a drop-in basis for summer visitors to the <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/seymourcenter/">Seymour Center</a> at Long Marine Lab. The summer drop-in programs offered during July and August complement the aquariums, exhibits, 87-foot blue whale skeleton, and other features visitors can enjoy year-round at the Seymour Center. No reservations are needed to take part in the summer drop-in programs, and there is no charge for the programs aside from the center's regular entrance fee.
</p>
<p><br />
In the Creature Feature program, focused activities with live animals in the seawater lab reveal amazing facts about marine creatures. Sea cucumbers, nudibranchs, and sea squirts are among the animals visitors can see and study. Seaside Storytelling brings marine science alive for kids through interactive storytelling. The Sea Crafts program offers a creative way for kids to learn about ocean inhabitants through art projects they can take home.<br />
<br />
The 25-minute Kid Tour, focusing on whales and dolphins, is specially geared for children ages 5 to 10 and their family members. Tour space is limited, so arrive early to sign up.<br />

  The Seymour Center is dedicated to educating people about the role scientific research plays in the conservation of the world's oceans. With exhibits focusing on the work of researchers in the <a href="http://natsci.ucsc.edu/ims/">Institute of Marine Sciences</a>, which operates Long Marine Laboratory, the center gives schoolchildren and the general public an inside look at the workings of a world-class marine research laboratory.
</p>
<p>
  The center features exhibit galleries, aquariums, teaching laboratories, classrooms, a conference hall, a unique gift and book store, and unsurpassed vistas of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary.<br />
  <br />
  Long Marine Lab is located at the end of Delaware Avenue in Santa Cruz, just past Natural Bridges State Beach. From Santa Cruz, take Highway One (Mission Street) north; turn left on Swift Street; turn right on Delaware Avenue; follow Delaware to the lab entrance at the end of the road.<br />
  <br />
  Visiting hours are Tuesday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Sunday from 12 to 5 p.m. Admission fees are $5 for adults and $3 for seniors (age 60 and older), students, and children ages 6 to 16; admission is free for children age 5 and under. For more information, call (831) 459-3800.
