  <font color="#003399">Science Media Fair April 6</font>
</h4>
<p>
  All science faculty, staff, and students are invited to attend a Science Media Fair on Thursday, April 6, from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. in Room 123 and the Bubble Room on the Main Floor of Sinsheimer Labs. Refreshments will be served. The event, hosted by UCSC Media Services and the Science Library, will offer informative presentations by a SciFinder expert from <i>Chemical Abstracts,</i> faculty on campus, and staff from Media Services and the Science Library.<br />
  <br />
  The purpose of the fair is to provide outreach and information exchange among science researchers and to publicize California Digital Library (CDL) databases; new science Web databases, such as Web of Science; library research, and teaching tools created by science faculty and University Libraries. A list of presentations and demonstrations will be announced at a later date. For more information, contact Wei Wei at (831) 459-3582 or wwei@cats.ucsc.edu.

</h4>
<p>
  Congressman Sam Farr will be the guest speaker at the third annual spring conference for Monterey Bay teachers and educators on Saturday, April 1. The event, "Setting the Standard in Science Education: A Celebration of Science Education," takes place from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. at Hartnell College in Salinas.<br />

</p>
<p>
  The conference will showcase the work of educators who have been participating in Life Lab's five-year LASERS project, the Language Acquisition in Science Education in Rural Schools program.

  <font color="#003399">UCSC ranked 11th in Peace Corps volunteers this year</font>
</h4>
<p>The <a href="http://www.peacecorps.gov/news/jan00feature.html">Peace Corps’ annual list</a> of colleges and universities with the largest number of volunteers serving overseas puts UCSC in the number 11 spot along with UC Davis. Last year UCSC was 22nd in the rankings. UCSC has 60 volunteers serving this year. The only other UC campus with more graduates in the Peace Corps is UC Berkeley, with 71 volunteers.</p>
<p>
  The Peace Corps will be recruiting 400 more volunteers this year, with plans to expand the program to 10,000 volunteers over the next few years. If you would like to find out more about opportunities in the Peace Corps, plan to attend one of two informational meetings in April. The first will be held on Wednesday, April 5, from 7 to 8:30 p.m. at Louden Nelson Community Center in downtown Santa Cruz, and the second on Thursday, April 6, from 1 to 2 p.m. at Oakes College, Guzman Lounge. Extensive information on the Peace Corps, including the experiences of current and past volunteers, is available on the <a href="http://www.peacecorps.gov/volunteer/index.html">Peace Corps' Web site.</a>

  <font color="#003399">Help get the word out about the Census in Beach Flats</font>
</h4>
<p>
  On Sunday, April 2, the Beach Flats Community Center and La Familia Center will be holding an event at the Beach Flats Park with food, music, and information about the Census. The Census is a very important opportunity to be counted for funding of community programs. Due to fear of incarceration or deportation many undocumented individuals do not fill out their Census forms. Others do not fill out the form because they simply cannot understand what it says. Volunteers are needed from 1 to 6 p.m. to help serve food, collect Census forms, and for set up and clean up at the event. Spanish speakers would be useful but are not a must. For more information, contact Carmen Rojas at crojas3892@hotmail.com.
