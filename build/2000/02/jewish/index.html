<h3>
  Kitty Klaidman The Past Purged: Hidden Memories of the Holocaust
</h3>
<p>
  UCSC Porter College Hall Gallery<br />
  Through February 27<br />
  Exhibition Hours: Monday through Friday: 10 a.m.-1 p.m. and 4 p.m.-7 p.m.<br />
  <br />
  Kitty Klaidman has been exhibiting her work since the mid-1960s in New York, London, Paris, Los Angeles, Washington, and other cities in Europe and the U.S. She currently has work in a traveling exhibition called "Witness and Legacy," which is touring museums throughout the country. Much of her work has been concerned with depicting physical fragments that prod us to remember the best and the worst of our history and culture. The UCSC exhibit draws on Klaidman's own history as a child in wartime Czechoslovakia, when she and her family were forced to hide in a dark, confined space for a year, but from which they emerged alive thanks to courageous Slovak farmers who hid them at the risk of their own lives. A later group of paintings in this exhibition commemorates the American dead at Normandy.

<h3>
  "Love": Jewish student art show
</h3>
<p>
  UCSC Porter College Bridge Gallery<br />
  Through February 27<br />
  Exhibition Hours: Monday through Friday: 10 a.m.-1 p.m. and 4 p.m.-7 p.m.<br />
  <br />
  Santa Cruz Hillel presents it first collaborative Jewish student art exhibition. Ten UCSC students have come together to present their artistic interpretations on the theme of Love. Artwork ranges from installation and performance to traditional mediums such as printmaking, painting, and photography. The interpretations on the theme of love vary from personal relationships to the love of creating art itself. The students come from a variety of academic disciplines and years of study with two things in common: their connection to Judaism and their love for art.

  "Contemporary Jewish Art: 1960-Present"
</h3>
<p>
  Nancy Berman, Director and Curator of the Skirball Museum in Los Angeles<br />
  Tuesday, February 22, 7 p.m., Baskin Arts Seminar Room<br />
  <br />
  In 1969, Berman was named assistant curator of the Judaica Department of the Jewish Museum in New York, a position she held until 1972. While at the Jewish Museum she participated in the excavation of the sixth-century Beth Sh'ean Synagogue in Israel, acting as liaison between the archeologists and student volunteers. When the Hebrew Union College relocated its collection of artwork, Judaica, and antiquities to the Los Angeles campus in 1972, Berman accepted the position of curator of the new Hebrew Union College Skirball Museum. In 1977 she was named director for the museum. Since 1989 she has been a member of the steering committee of the Arts Consortium, a seven-member group representing multicultural arts organizations in Los Angeles.
