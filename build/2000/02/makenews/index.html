  <b>David Cope</b>'s Experiments in Musical Intelligence was the subject of a story on CNET about recently developed computer programs that can be used to make music. Cope was also featured in a segment on ABC's <i>World News Now.</i> The two-minute segment used a short clip from a film by Porter academic preceptor <b>Bob Giges</b> on Cope titled <i>Bach Lives!...At David Cope's House.</i> Because the film was used, UCSC conductor <b>Nicole Paiement</b> also made a cameo on the air. <b><br />
  <br /></b>Anthropologist <b>Nancy Chen</b>'s expertise in qigong and Falun Gong is well known among journalists, the most recent of whom talked with her while reporting an article for the <i>New York Times</i> about cancer patients in China who are trying to harness the invisible forces of qigong to fight their disease.

  <b>Brent Haddad</b> of environmental studies is fielding calls about his new book on water policy. He was interviewed by a reporter with American News Service and appeared on KSCO Radio. Next up is KUSP Radio, where he'll appear on March 27 at 12:30 p.m.

  Last week's vote on mandatory grades attracted coverage from the local media, including the <i>Santa Cruz County Sentinel</i> and KCBA-TV, as well as beyond the local area. The <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> joined the <i>San Jose Mercury News</i> in covering the story, and both papers quoted several faculty members and instructors, including <b>Bob Ludwig</b>, <b>George Brown</b>, <b>Geoffrey Pullum</b>, <b>Dan Linger</b>, <b>Barbara Rogoff</b>, <b>Tim Fitzmaurice</b>, <b>Peter Euben</b>, and <b>Martha Zuniga</b>. KQED Radio's coverage included interviews with <b>Daniel Press</b>, <b>Barry Bowman</b>, and <b>Roger Anderson</b>.

  In a <i>Metro Santa Cruz</i> story on UCSC alum Marti Noxon, women's studies scholar <b>Bettina Aptheker</b> was credited as being the inspiration for an episode of <i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer,</i> the WB channel show about a teenager who fights forces of darkness in the halls of her high school by day and in the vampire world by night. Aptheker herself isn't a vampire expert, but she does know a lot about goddesses, and Noxon, who writes for the hit show, said themes in an episode called "The Wish" were inspired by Aptheker's class lectures on goddesses.<br />
  <br />
  The intensive news coverage of the discovery by astronomer <b>Anthony Misch</b> of a manuscript by Johannes Kepler persisted when <i>National Geographic</i> magazine ran a half-page story in its January 2000 issue.<br />
