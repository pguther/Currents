  <h1>Campus closure exceptions outlined</h1>

  
  <p class="date">Public Information Office</p>
  

  <p>
  <br />
  In addition to the scheduled 2000-01 holidays of December 25, 26, and 29,<br />
  and January 1, and the weekend days of December 23, 24, 30, and 31, much of the campus will be shut down on December 27 and 28.<br />
  <br />
  For safety reasons, police and fire units will be on duty throughout the shutdown period. In case of emergency, people on campus should call the campus emergency number, 911. Minimal custodial service will be provided for those facilities that remain open. Building and Utility Services personnel will be on standby.<br />
  <br />
  The following campus units have arranged to be open and/or have limited staff available during all or part of the shutdown. Except where noted, these arrangements cover the non-holiday weekdays (December 27 and 28) during the shutdown period. For security reasons, buildings will not be routinely unlocked. Therefore, faculty and staff will need building keys or must make special arrangements to ensure access to their buildings.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Arboretum will be open.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>The Bay Tree Bookstore will be staffed to unload, price, and shelve textbooks. It will not be open for sales during the break.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Communications and Technology Services will provide limited computer support services. Campus network problems should be reported on the IRC help phone, 459-4357. Telephone service during this period will be the same as the campus normally provides on weekends and holidays. For details about these and other CATS services, see the web site at <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/cats/sc/help/news/2000/00.11.20.campusclosure.shtml">http://www2.ucsc.edu/cats/sc/help/news/2000/00.11.20.campusclosure.shtml.<br /></a>
  </li>
  <li>The Graduate Division Admissions Section will be staffed to process applications.<br />
    <br />

  <li>The Housing, Dining and Child Care Services Information Technology department in the Housing Administration Building will remain open to complete miscellaneous projects.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>KZSC will be in operation per FCC regulations.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>The McHenry and Science Libraries will be open for circulation only on December 27 and 28 from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.<br />

    <br />

  <li>Mail Services (Baskin Engineering) will have limited staffing to sort incoming mail. U.S. mail and items delivered by other carriers which do not require a signature will be delivered to all colleges according to the normal schedule; proctors will sort the mail in the evenings. Deliveries requiring signatures will not be accepted; students expecting such deliveries should contact the carrier to arrange pick-up.
  </li>
  <li>Natural Sciences laboratory buildings and the trailers surrounding science buildings will be kept operational to support ongoing research.<br />
    <br />

  <li>OPERS will have facilities open for scheduled maintenance and for sports practices and events.<br />

    <br />

  <li>At every college, utilities will be provided to residence halls, apartments, guest suites, faculty apartments, and college houses.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  All campus units closing during this shutdown period are urged to make sure that computing equipment and refrigerators are shut down for maximum energy savings. If disposing of food from refrigerators, please place it in dumpsters to avoid pests and spoiled food in buildings. If you are working during the closure, please be sure to turn off lights, computers, and other electrical equipment upon leaving the area. Also, make sure doors are locked when you leave. To avoid fire hazard risks, please do not use electric space heaters during the shutdown.<br />
  <br />
  Please note that buildings tend to take a significantly longer time to warm up after a shutdown even though the heating systems are on. You are encouraged to dress warmly when working in buildings that have been closed. The Heating Plant requests your cooperation and patience during the first week of January as buildings are brought back to their normal temperatures.<br />
  <br />
  To contact Business and Administrative Services, call (831) 459-3778.
