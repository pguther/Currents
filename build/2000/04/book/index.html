<p>
  A large crowd gathered April 13 to celebrate the winners of the 34th annual Book Collection Contest. The contest, which is sponsored by the Friends of the UCSC Library, has three sections: one for UCSC students, one for area high school students in 9th and 10th grades, and one for area high school students in 11th and 12th grades. In each category there is a first- second- and third-place winner (this year, at the high school level, there was a tie in one of the third-place categories and an honorable mention).
</p>
<p>Contest entrants at the university level are eligible only if they actually own a collection of 25 or more books, but high school students need only imagine their collection–describing a set of books and other materials that reflects a passionate interest. Contest entrants submit a bibliography and an essay describing the special value of their collection. The high school students need only imagine a collection that reflects a passionate interest and submit an annotated bibliography and an essay describing the special value of their collection. The winners’ collections and winning essays are on display at the McHenry Library at UCSC.<br />
<br />
At the awards ceremony winners were awarded a certificate, cash prizes, and the high school students also received a bookstore gift certificate for use by their high school library.<br />
<br />
Also at the awards ceremony, the Friends of the UCSC Library dedicated a bench in memory of Candy Coonerty who was a Friends board member and a great supporter of the library.<br /></p>
