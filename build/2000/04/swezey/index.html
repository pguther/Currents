  Growing apples the new, old-fashioned way--organically--just got a whole lot easier for this important California crop. Recently available from the University of California is the <i>Organic Apple Production Manual,</i> a concise, 72-page compendium of more than 20 years of state-of-the-art UC research and grower experience.<br />
  <br />
</p>
<p>“This is an indispensable resource for current or potential producers of organic apples,” said coauthor Sean L. Swezey, associate director of UCSC’s Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems and director of the Sustainable Agriculture Research and Education Program (SAREP). “Modern apple production is a highly technical undertaking to begin with. Producing apples organically requires even more vigilance and ingenuity to deal effectively with pest control, soil fertility, and postharvest handling and other management challenges.”<br />
<br />
The manual covers a review of the organic apple industry, including trends in production and markets, supply and price, certification requirements, and other state and federal regulations. Individual chapters explore orchard management, disease and pest management, harvest and postharvest operations, marketing considerations, and economic performance. Published by the UC Division of Agriculture and Natural Resources (ANR), the <i>Organic Apple Production Manual</i> is illustrated with 20 color photographs and 19 tables, contains an extensive index, and lists a comprehensive bibliography of related publications for apple growers.<br />
<br />
Organic and conventional growers alike will find a wealth of information on issues of common concern. Conventional growers considering the transition to organic production and certification will learn why it’s important to make the shift carefully and incrementally. Guidelines on what records to keep, who to contact, and what to expect during the transition are also included.<br />
<br />
Many of the basic agronomic practices are the same for both organic and conventional apple production systems. These are well documented in two other ANR publications–<i>Commercial Apple Growing in California</i> (ANR Publication 2456) and <i>Integrated Pest Management for Apples and Pears,</i> 2nd edition (ANR Publication 3340). Together with the <i>Organic Apple Production Manual</i> these publications comprise an essential reference kit necessary for anyone considering organic apple production.<br />
<br />
California is emerging as one of the nation’s leading apple producers with approximately 10 percent of the total, exceeded only by Washington state. The increase is due in large part to plantings of Granny Smith and Fuji varieties in the San Joaquin Valley during the last 15 years. Of the roughly 36,000 acres of apples grown in California, a small but increasingly significant percentage are grown organically. The future is bright for this growing market segment. Demand for organically grown apples has increased since the Alar scare of 1989. Many supermarkets responded then by adding organically grown apples and they’re a staple in consumer cooperatives, natural food stores, specialty produce stores, farmers’ markets, and other direct-marketing outlets.</p>
