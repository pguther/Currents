  <a href="mailto:mckenna@cats.ucsc.edu"><br /></a> Educators are invited to attend a two-day symposium on teacher quality that is being sponsored by UCSC's <a href="http://newteachercenter.org">New Teacher Center</a> on January 27-28. The gathering, "Keeping the Dream Alive: A Quality Teacher for Every Child," will focus on teacher quality and educational equity, with an emphasis on new teacher support and development of the teaching profession. The meeting will take place at the Doubletree Hotel in Monterey. Among the nationally prominent presenters are Kati Haycock, director of The Education Trust in Washington, D.C., who will deliver the opening keynote address, entitled "Good Teaching Matters," on January 27. Also presenting will be Sharon Feiman-Nemser, professor in the Department of Teacher Education at Michigan State University, who will discuss how mentor teachers combine support and assessment; Enid Lee, a Toronto-based education consultant who will deliver the morning keynote address entitled "Teaching for Transformation," on January 28; and Terry Janicki, a consultant with the California Commission on Teacher Credentialing, who will participate in a panel presentation on teacher induction called "The State of Affairs." Fees are $250 per person, including reception, meals, and materials. Hotel accommodations and parking are additional. To register, or for more information, call the New Teacher Center at (831) 459-4323. The UCSC-based New Teacher Center, located in downtown Santa Cruz, is a national resource dedicated to teacher development and the support of programs and practices that promote excellence and diversity in America's teaching force. The nation's schools will hire at least two million new teachers over the next decade, yet more than one-third of all new teachers leave the profession within the first three years. The New Teacher Center encourages schools to invest in innovative induction practices that provide the support beginning teachers need to become highly skilled, committed, and caring professionals.
