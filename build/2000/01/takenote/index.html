  <font color="#003399">Calendar to be distributed to faculty and staff</font>

<p>
  The campus's Imaging, Printing, Mail, and Temporary Staffing (IPMTS) unit has produced a Year 2000 calendar for all faculty and staff.

  <font color="#003399">Thumbs Up Award Program 1999-2000</font>
</h4>
<p>
  <img align="right" border="0" height="123" src="../art/thumbsup.1.gif" width="106" alt="" />Human Resources is once again sponsoring the popular Thumbs Up Award Program for staff. It is the only recognition program in which all staff and administrators are eligible to participate, and everyone who is nominated receives a certificate of appreciation and a small gift. Awards can be given to an individual staff member, a team, or a faculty member in an administrative role for providing special service to the campus community. Every nominee is a winner.
</p>
<p>
  The nomination process this year will be similar to last year. Staff will be able to submit a maximum of five nominations via the Web during three weeks in March, and staff who do not have access to the Web will be able to send written nominations to Susan Taylor, c/o Chancellor's Office. The 2000 Thumbs Up Award announcement and detailed guidelines will be mailed to all staff, via campus mail, during February.

  <font color="#003399">Construction Update</font>
</h4>
<p>
  Construction will start on the <b>Interdisciplinary Sciences Building,</b> a new addition to the eastern end of Natural Sciences 2, in early February and last through fall 2001. Expect traffic delays on Steinhart Way, the service road to the Science Library, Earth and Marine Sciences, and Natural Sciences 2.
</p>
<p>
  Construction of the <b>Core West Parking Structure</b> at the intersection of Heller and McLaughlin Drives has already begun and is expected to last until December 2000. Beginning in February, many cement trucks will be traveling up Heller Drive and turning onto McLaughlin Drive about once a week. Expect traffic delays in the project area.<br />
  <br />
  <b>Parking Lots 112 and 113</b> are closed. In order to compensate for these lost parking spaces, the North Remote Parking Lot is now reserved for cars with A and B parking permits and is no longer available for remote parking permits.<br />
  <br />
  Work will continue on the new <b>Bay Tree Bookstore and Graduate Commons Buildings</b> through summer 2000. There will be occasional traffic delays due to construction vehicles.
