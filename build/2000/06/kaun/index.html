<p>
  David Kaun, a professor of economics at UCSC, has worked with some very good graduate students over the years. But he was so impressed by two talented teaching assistants last fall that he has given the campus $50,000 to establish a new annual award that will recognize outstanding teaching by graduate students.
</p>
<p>Two graduate student recipients of the new Milam-McGinty-Kaun Award will be named each year, one from the Economics Department and one from another department in the Division of Social Sciences. Each will receive a $1,000 award. The award is named after its first recipients, Garrett Milam and Matt McGinty, who are in UCSC’s doctoral program in international economics. Milam and McGinty were teaching assistants last fall in Kaun’s <i>Intermediate Microeconomic Theory</i> course, which had an enrollment of about 120 undergraduates.<br />
<br />
“It was a tough course–tough for me because I hadn’t taught it in a long time, and tough for the students because of the material,” recalled Kaun, crediting Milam and McGinty with making major contributions to the success of the course and inspiring him to establish the endowment. “These two wonderful young men were phenomenal in every dimension. They were so good, I just wanted to acknowledge that kind of teaching assistance.”<br />
<br />
Milam and McGinty, who worked together as teaching assistants in the same course during their first quarter on campus, have each been teaching assistants in numerous courses since they arrived at UCSC in 1996. Good friends, they both “actually enjoy teaching,” said Milam, who plans to become a university professor of economics.<br />
<br />
“This is what I’ve wanted to do since my second year of college,” said Milam.<br />
<br />
McGinty’s memories of his undergraduate days at Michigan State University inspire him in the classroom. “I had some experiences with bad TAs and never wanted to be one,” said McGinty, describing the satisfaction he gets from helping students understand difficult and complex economic concepts.<br />
<br />
“It’s a challenge for me to try to make sure the top of the class isn’t bored and the bottom isn’t left behind,” he added. “My goal is inclusiveness. I want all of the students to feel like the class is worth their time.”<br />
<br />
The course focused on the principles of microeconomics, which Kaun described as the “heart and soul” of economics. The field looks at individuals in three roles–as consumers, workers, and the owners of organizations–to understand and attempt to predict their behavior in economic settings.<br />
<br />
McGinty joked that dedicated graduate students represent a failing of economists’ ability to predict human behavior, because they work hard despite marginal incentives and rewards. “I’d like to thank David for providing this incentive for teaching well,” McGinty said upon receiving the award. “As graduate students, there are lots of reasons not to devote time to teaching, including your own studies, but to be a good TA, you have to care about your students.”<br />
<br />
The gift is not Kaun’s first. He has established a $100,000 music scholarship that will, when it is fully funded, provide full support for a clarinet player. “The arts, and music in particular, have always been my first love,” said Kaun, who hopes his gifts move others to give generously. “Andrew Carnegie once said there are only three things to do with your money, and two of them are rather stupid. He said you can leave it for the government to tax away, you can leave it to your children, or you can spend it wisely in ways you think are appropriate. For me, these contributions to the university are a wise thing to do, and fun as well.”<br />
<br />
Graduate students in anthropology, economics, education, environmental studies, politics, psychology, and sociology will be eligible for future awards.</p>
