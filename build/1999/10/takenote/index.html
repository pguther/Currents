  <font color="#003399">Public hearing on the Supplemental EIR for Colleges Nine and Ten Residence Halls and Dining Hall</font>
</h4>
<p>
  <font color="#000000">A Draft Supplemental Environmental Impact Report (SEIR) has been prepared for the Colleges Nine and Ten Residence Halls and Dining Hall project. A Public Hearing will be held on November 8 between 6 and 8 p.m. at the Barn Theater. At this meeting, campus planners will provide a description of the project and its environmental effects, and members of the public will be invited to give oral comments on the Draft SEIR for the project. Call Christine Aldecoa at (831) 459-4407 for additional information or to request accommodations for persons with disabilities.</font>
</p>
<p>
  <font color="#000000">The proposed project is the construction of six residence halls (approximately 124,200 assignable square feet) and a dining hall (approximately 31,500 asf) on the Colleges Nine and Ten site north of McLaughlin Drive in the central UCSC campus. The residence halls would provide bed spaces for approximately 807 students. The dining hall building would house dining hall facilities for the residence halls and also a University Center, with a lounge, dining hall, kitchen, and conference rooms.</font><br />
