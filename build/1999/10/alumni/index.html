<p>
  The <a href="http://alumni.ucsc.edu/">UCSC Alumni Association</a> welcomed its 10,000th member this week, marking the latest milestone for an organization that has supported the university since its first class graduated in 1968.
</p>
<p>
  The newest member is Melyssa Jo Kelly, a re-entry student who graduated from UCSC with a degree in women's studies in 1996.
</p>
<p>“I joined so I could stay in touch, and make it easy for faculty and my classmates to get in touch with me,” said Kelly, administrator of the violence against women programs for the San Francisco Commission on the Status of Women.</p>
<p>
  Rob Barandas, membership and marketing director for the association, said popular benefits of membership are the free library borrowing privileges at all UC campuses, the alumni locator service that helps graduates find their old friends, and discounts at campus recreation facilities.
</p>
<p>
  "But the main reason people join is to show support for the campus, not because of any tangible benefits," said Barandas. "It's nice to get the benefits, but they want to maintain their connections to the campus."
</p>
<p>
  Barandas, a 1991 graduate of UCSC, posts a monthly printout of the number of association members on his door, framed by a UCSC Alumni Association license plate holder. By enrolling 25 percent of the 40,000 graduates for whom it has addresses, the UCSC Alumni Association is doing very well for a campus of its size and age, said Barandas. About 47,000 students have graduated from UCSC. Among UC alumni associations, the UCSC organization trails only UC Berkeley and UCLA in the ratio of graduates to members, he noted.
</p>
<p>
  The association was established in 1968 to promote, influence, and support the educational, cultural, and social life of UCSC. Its members serve the university, its colleges, and students, and members help guide the university in the future. A 24-member Alumni Council is the governing body of the association. Membership fees help support campus programs, including undergraduate scholarships.
</p>
<p>
  Annual membership dues are $35; lifetime membership is available for a one-time payment of $450, or five payments of $100/year. All graduates are offered a free one-year membership in the association to introduce them to the organization. Next year, the association will publish a comprehensive <i>Year 2000 Alumni Directory</i> that will be available for members to purchase.
