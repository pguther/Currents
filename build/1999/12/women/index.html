<p>
  One of the country's oldest and most respected programs in women's studies turns 25 this year. The program is UCSC's very own, which was established in 1973-74 and sent its first graduates into the world in 1974-75.
</p>
<p>An interdisciplinary program, <a href="http://humwww.ucsc.edu/wst/index.html">women’s studies</a> incorporates numerous fields, including history, literature, politics, sociology, and philosophy.</p>
<p>
  A sign of its prestige and broad-based appeal is the fact that the department attracts more adjunct professors (more than 50 this year) than any other at UCSC.
</p>
<p>
  To mark its anniversary, the department is hosting two years of special events. Among them are the following:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Molly Ivins: One of the nation's wittiest and best known political pundits, Ivins will be in Santa Cruz to present a talk titled "Campaign 2000." Ivins is a nationally syndicated political columnist and best-selling author of a number of books, including <i>Molly Ivins Can't Say That, Can She?</i> The talk is sponsored by UCSC Arts &amp; Lectures, the Women's Studies Department, and the Women's Center. Sunday, March 26, 8 p.m., Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Women's Studies Founders Luncheon: Women's studies faculty, students, and alumni are invited to this special gathering, which takes place during the Banana Slug Spring Fair reunion weekend. Chancellor Greenwood will join the luncheon, which honors women's studies founding faculty members and program graduates. Sunday, April 16, 11 am to 2 pm, UCSC Arboretum.<br />
    <br />
  </li>

    <br />
  </li>
  <li>"Towards A Multicultural Women's History": A residency by visiting scholars Darlene Clark Hine, professor of African American history at Michigan State University, and Vicki Ruiz, professor of Chicana history at Arizona State University. May 1-4.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>"Sovereignty 2000: Locations of Contestation and Possibility": A conference sponsored by the Native American Studies Research Cluster and the Women's Studies Department. May 19-20.<br />
