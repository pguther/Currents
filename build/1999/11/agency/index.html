  <h1>Governor Davis signs 'agency shop' bill</h1>

  
  <p class="date">Public Information Office</p>
  

  <p>
  Gov. Gray Davis has signed SB 645, a bill passed by the Legislature<br />
  requiring "agency shop" at the University of California and California<br />
  State University. The new law takes effect Jan. 1, 2000, and will result in<br />
  mandatory paycheck deductions for union-represented UC employees who do not currently pay union membership dues.<br />
  <br />
  The bill states that, "as a condition of continued employment," UC<br />
  employees who are in a bargaining unit exclusively represented by a union<br />
  must either join the union and pay its dues or pay a "fair share" fee to<br />
  the union. This fee would help cover the union's costs for negotiation,<br />
  contract administration and related activities.<br />
  <br />
  The amount of the "fair share" fee will be determined by each of the<br />
  University's unions. The bill states that the fee shall not exceed the<br />
  union's regular membership dues.<br />
  <br />
  UC faculty who are eligible for Academic Senate membership are exempt from<br />
  the bill.<br />
  <br />
  The University opposed the union-sponsored measure in the Legislature,<br />
  arguing that UC employees should have the opportunity to vote on any<br />
  "agency shop" arrangement before it is put into place. UC's view did not<br />
  prevail in the legislative process, however. The University now is<br />
  committed to fulfilling its legal obligations to implement the new law and<br />
  will be working with UC's unions on the details of implementation.<br />
  <br />
  According to the legislation, the "fair share" deductions are to begin<br />
  "upon notification to the employer by the exclusive representative," but no<br />
  sooner than Jan. 1. UC will be discussing the implementation timeline with<br />
  each of its unions and is currently examining the payroll processing<br />
  changes necessary to implement the "fair share" deductions. Additional<br />
  information about this process will be provided as it becomes available.<br />
  <br />
  The bill allows an employee "who is a member of a bona fide religion, body<br />
  or sect that has historically held conscientious objections to joining or<br />
  financially supporting public employee organizations" to instead pay an<br />
  amount equivalent to the "fair share" fee to a "nonreligious, nonlabor<br />
  charitable fund." The union and the University may designate a list of such<br />
  charitable funds to which conscientious objectors may direct their<br />
  contribution.<br />
  <br />
  Employees who are unsure if they are in a bargaining unit represented by a<br />
  union and thus affected by the new law should contact their supervisor or<br />
  their local Office of Labor Relations. Those with questions about the<br />
  details of implementation, including the amount of a union's "fair share"<br />
  fee or the procedures for conscientious objectors, should contact their<br />
  union directly.<br />
  <br />
  Under the legislation, the "agency shop" arrangement may be rescinded by a<br />
  majority vote of all employees in a bargaining unit if at least 30 percent<br />
  of the employees in that unit petition for such a vote. The election would<br />
  be administered by the state Public Employment Relations Board.<br />
  <br />
  Thirteen unions represent more than 60,000 UC employees in 31 bargaining<br />
  units. These unions and their corresponding bargaining units are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Alameda County Building and Construction Trades Council (skilled crafts employees at UC Berkeley and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory);
  </li>
  <li>American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (Service Unit, Patient Care Technical Unit, and skilled crafts employees at UC Santa Cruz);
  </li>
  <li>American Federation of Teachers (Non-Senate Instructional Unit and Professional Librarian Unit);
  </li>
  <li>Association of Graduate Student Employees-United Auto Workers (local bargaining units of graduate teaching assistants, readers and tutors);
  </li>
  <li>California Nurses Association (Registered Nurse Unit);<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Coalition of University Employees (Clerical Unit);<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Federated University Police Officers Association (Police Officer Unit);<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>International Union of Operating Engineers (skilled crafts employees at UC Irvine, UCLA, UC Riverside, UC San Diego and UC Santa Barbara);
  </li>
  <li>Printing Trades Alliance (printing trades employees);<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Public Safety Officers Association (protective services officers at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory);
  </li>
  <li>San Francisco Building and Construction Trades Council (skilled crafts employees at UC San Francisco);
  </li>
  <li>Santa Cruz Faculty Association (UC Santa Cruz faculty); and
  </li>
  <li>University Professional and Technical Employees-Communications Workers of America (Technical Unit, Research Support Professional Unit and Residual Patient Care Professional Unit).
  </li>
</ul>
