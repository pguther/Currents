  <h1>UCSC New Teacher Center brokers unprecedented agreement</h1>

  The UCSC New Teacher Center's role as a major player in state educational issues was underscored recently when the center brokered an unprecedented agreement between key teacher unions and school management groups. Following extended negotiations that took place during the summer at the behest of the center, four organizations were able to draft a statement of cooperation and support regarding the implementation of controversial legislation designed to improve the teaching profession. The agreement represents "a very promising signal," Education Secretary Gary Hart said during a Sacramento press conference announcing the agreement. "The most important players in the California public education system are joining forces in the best interest of our children's future." The legislation, dubbed the California Peer Assistance and Review Program for Teachers, or PAR, was designed to improve the classroom performance of teachers by establishing programs to assist veteran teachers who are experiencing difficulties. Under the new law, these teachers are assisted and their performance is reviewed by a select group of high-performing teachers. The bill's author, Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa, said the joint agreement "ensures teachers and schools are given the appropriate types of assistance developed locally for them to succeed--with the larger goal of improving the education of our children." New Teacher Center Director Ellen Moir applauded the willingness of the four organizations--the California Teachers Association, the California Federation of Teachers, the Association of California School Administrators, and the California School Boards Association--to reach agreement. "To their enormous credit, these four organizations felt that they must put aside their differences, in relation to this issue, to formulate a coordinated response to this legislation," she said. "They realize the stakes--Peer Assistance and Review represents an exciting opportunity for the teaching profession. However, PAR requires teachers, administrators, districts, and unions to work together in new ways." The joint statement, she said, encourages local school districts and unions to "stretch" in order to make PAR work for students and teachers. "The New Teacher Center is proud to have facilitated this important agreement," she added. Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood heralded the announcement. "By facilitating this agreement, the UC Santa Cruz New Teacher Center has demonstrated its leadership role in education," said Greenwood. "As the state of California addresses one of our most pressing social problems, the University of California, Santa Cruz, is proud to share its resources and expertise." Statewide implementation of PAR represents a major challenge, given its impact on the way schools operate and funding incentives that reward early development of PAR programs. Teachers are asked to take on significant new levels of responsibility to ensure teacher quality, and district administrators are asked to share what has been their traditional turf. Therefore, key management and labor groups felt compelled to address issues that could present obstacles at the local district level and at the bargaining table. The legislation allows teachers to be observed over time, and Moir expressed optimism that the law "can be used by all teachers to strengthen the teaching profession." "Our meetings concerning this legislation produced some of the most exciting, groundbreaking conversations I've heard about the profession," said Moir. "Clearly, the representatives from all four groups felt there was a window here to make real changes in the teaching profession and in the ways teachers and administrators work with one another."
