  <b>October 15 concert planned in celebration of Khan's appointment</b>
</p>
<p>
  Sarode master Ali Akbar Khan, considered to be one of the world's greatest living musicians, has been named Distinguished Adjunct Professor of Music at UCSC.
</p>
<p>A “national living treasure” of India, Khan is regarded as the most accomplished interpreter of Indian classical music alive today. Khan accepted his UCSC appointment this week. His first formal activity with UCSC will be a public concert in the campus’s Music Center Recital Hall on Friday, October 15, at 8 p.m. (See below for details.)<br />
<br />
“We feel very privileged to have the opportunity of collaborating with such an extraordinary artist,” said Edward Houghton, dean of the Arts Division. “Khansahib is not only an outstanding musician and dedicated teacher but also the heir and principal exemplar of a long and distinguished musical tradition. He will be a remarkable resource for our students and for our expanding programs in the arts and cultures of India.”<br />
<br />
“This is a very unique collaboration between the university and my college,” Khan said. “I’m very happy we will be working together. In my family, the knowledge and tradition of this music is very important and I want to be able to pass that on to future generations. My family learned this music originally in the 16th century at the time of Emperor Akbar. This is a wonderful thing that’s going to happen with the university–this connection is an important way of keeping this music alive.”<br />
<br />
Through the Ali Akbar College of Music in San Rafael and a branch in Switzerland, Khan has overseen the instruction of more than 15,000 students since 1967. Khan learned to value the teaching of music from his father, Acharya Allauddin Khan, one of India’s greatest musicians and teachers.<br />
<br />
“My father taught me from the beginning how to learn, how to teach, and how to compose. I started learning with my father when I was only three and he continued to teach me every day for 15 hours a day for more than 20 years, up until he was 100 years old. From him I learned the importance of teaching others.”<br />
<br />
Khan, 77, is a preeminent master of classical North Indian music. Khan is admired by both Eastern and Western audiences for his brilliant compositions and his mastery of the beautiful and complex 25-string sarode. His performances and recordings of Indian music are legendary, and today he is unquestionably one of the most respected and acclaimed Indian musicians in the world.</p>
<p>
  Over the decades Khan has performed for more than 8 million people, recorded more than 95 albums, and received accolades across the globe. Some of his most recent honors include a National Heritage Fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts, a MacArthur Foundation Fellowship, and five Grammy Award nominations.<br />
  <br />
  As distinguished adjunct professor, Khan will present occasional concerts, master classes, and workshops, both on his own and with associates. He will advise the Arts Division in the development of courses and resources in the classical music of India and facilitate a regular flow of outstanding visiting performers.<br />
  <br />
  The October 15 concert will feature Ustad (master) Ali Akbar Khan, Pandit Swapan Chaudhuri on the tabla, and Ustad Ali Akbar Khan's son, Alam, on the sarode.
