  <h1>Twelve community college students receive $20,000 scholarships to UCSC</h1>

<p>
  In a joyful rite of spring, UCSC has selected 12 regional community college students who will receive $20,000 scholarships to enroll at the university this fall.
</p>
<p>
  This year's recipients of the Karl S. Pister Leadership Opportunity Awards include single parents, immigrants from Mexico and Vietnam, and re-entry students.
</p>
<p>
  The awards recognize talented students who have overcome adverse socioeconomic circumstances, have a demonstrated commitment to assisting and improving the lives of others, and who might not otherwise be able to attend UCSC for financial reasons. Recipients receive $10,000 scholarships for each of two years, as well as the support of a strong academic mentoring program and assistance finding summer work experience in a field that complements their studies.
</p>
<p>
  "This scholarship program opens doors to some of the most academically talented and determined students who enroll at UCSC each year, and I am proud to welcome them to our campus," said UCSC Chancellor Denice D. Denton. "Their contributions enrich our student community, and their achievements inspire us all."
</p>
<p>
  The presidents of 13 regional community colleges each nominate several students, and recipients are selected by Denton in consultation with the Leadership Opportunity Awards Screening Committee. The program was established in 1993 by former UCSC Chancellor Karl S. Pister to foster the transfer of accomplished community college students to UCSC.
</p>
<p>
  A list of this year's recipients follows, with hometowns and college affiliations. Biographical information about each recipient is also available below. For more information about the scholarship program or any of the recipients, call the UCSC Public Information Office at (831) 459-2495.
