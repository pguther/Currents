  Everything from opera to environmental research will be on display as the campus celebrates Student Achievement Week May 30-June 5 with live performances, exhibitions, symposia, and an awards ceremony.
</p>
<p>
  "Recognition of the outstanding achievements of our students is one of the ways in which UCSC demonstrates its commitment to excellence in teaching and research," said interim vice provost and dean of undergraduate education William Ladusaw.<br />
