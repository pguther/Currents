<p>
  In two weeks, Katie Walsh will touch down in Taiwan to begin an 11-month adventure--teaching English and American culture to elementary schoolchildren as a Fulbright Scholar.
</p>
<p>
  The 21-year-old College Ten student has just received her bachelor of arts degree in history from UCSC with an emphasis on Asia and the Middle East.
</p>
<p>
  She marked the occasion by delivering the student commencement address on Saturday at her college graduation ceremonies.
</p>
<p>
  A transfer student from Bryn Mawr, Walsh came to UCSC in the fall of 2003 after taking a year off to work for the educational wing of AmeriCorps.
</p>
<p>
  "Essentially it's the domestic Peace Corps," Walsh noted. "During the mornings, I mentored six second graders learning English as a second language who had just come over from mainland China; in the afternoon, I was a teacher for 29 third graders."
</p>
<p>
  Upon her arrival at UCSC, Walsh found her niche on campus at the College Ten International Living Center where she resided for a year with students from a variety of countries around the world. She soon became the coordinator of the International Affairs Group, a student organization that met every week to talk about politics and culture.
</p>
<p>
  Walsh also participated in the Chancellor's Undergraduate Internship Program, working with Praxis--a service-learning organization at Colleges Nine and Ten. "We did a number of different community-service projects throughout Santa Cruz for groups like the Homeless Garden Project and Jacob's Heart, which provides support for children with cancer," Walsh said. "We also helped out with a benefit concert that was held at the Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium to raise money for Oxfam, the global relief agency."
</p>
<p>
  Last spring, Walsh also found time to travel to Mexico with a group of 30 students as part of UCSC's Alternative Spring Break program, to help build a house for a Mexican family.
</p>
<p>
  Walsh said that she has been very impressed with the quality and support offered to her by faculty during her time at UCSC. "When I first transferred here, I took a course in history with Alan Christy and his class was amazing and intriguing--he was unlike any professor I had encountered at Bryn Mawr," she noted. "And I've taken classes from Gail Hershatter who has been extremely approachable, supportive, and inspiring--she helped me with my academic and career plans."
</p>
<p>
  "What also makes UCSC so dynamic and powerful has been the activism on this campus--how passionate students are and how committed they are to social justice," Walsh added. "That passion doesn't exist at many other campuses."
</p>
<p>
  After returning from Taiwan in 2006, Walsh plans to further her education--by traveling throughout Asia to visit friends and contacts she made at the College Ten International Living Center--before considering a possible career in education and public policy. "To successfully do education, community, and social justice work, I feel it's essential to learn and understand the history of different cultures," she observed.
