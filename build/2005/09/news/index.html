  In Hurricane Katrina news:<br />
  The <i>New York Times</i> called on racism expert <b>David Wellman</b> of community studies to discuss the racial divide apparent even in relief concerts. Wellman was quoted in a <i>Los Angeles Times</i> article about the debate over whether race played a role in response efforts. Wellman was also quoted in the <i>Sacramento Bee,</i> discussing how the natural disaster has shined a spotlight on the vulnerability of black Americans. His comments were picked up by the <i>Monterey County Herald</i>. . . . The <i>New York Times</i> contacted professor emeritus of psychology <b>Elliot Aronson</b> in the wake of the Katrina disaster for insight into the surge of lawlessness that broke out. . . . Politics professor <b>Daniel Wirls</b> helped the <i>San Jose Mercury News</i> sort out the political fallout for President Bush of his handling of the Katrina disaster. Wirls also fielded a call from the <i>Santa Cruz Sentinel</i> about a judge's ruling that the Pledge of Allegiance is unconstitutional. . . . <b>Tom Pettigrew</b>, research professor of psychology and an expert on racism, was a guest on Community TV's <i>Voices</i> program, discussing "the storm after the storm." . . . Senior cook <b>Bruce Holgers</b> was featured in a <i>Santa Cruz Sentinel</i> story about volunteers pitching in to help hurricane victims. After a brief Red Cross training, Holgers was flown to Baton Rouge to help feed the hungry. . . . The new community studies internship to help hurricane-stricken areas coordinated by <b>Mike Rotkin</b> got broad play, including coverage by the Associated Press, KTVU TV, the <i>San Jose Mercury News, Tuscaloosa</i> (Alabama) <i>News,</i> <i>Contra Costa Times, Modesto Bee</i>, radio stations in Pennsylvania, Louisiana, and Alabama, as well as the <i>Santa Cruz Sentinel</i>, the <i>Monterey County Herald</i>, and KSBW TV. . . . Theater arts lecturer <b>Don Williams</b> was quoted in a <i>Santa Cruz Sentinel</i> article about the role of race in the government response to Hurricane Katrina.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Ann Pace,</strong> assistant director of the Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering, was quoted in a <i>Santa Cruz Sentinel</i> story about a training grant for stem cell research.

<p>
  The <i>Washington Times</i> cited the work of economist <b>Lori Kletzer</b> in a story about the hidden cost of free trade and the shortcomings of worker-retraining programs.
</p>
<p>
  The <i>Houston Chronicle</i> quoted history professor Dana Frank about about what it really means to buy American, noting that "trade policy, not consumer demand, drives global commerce" as it creates job losses and closed plants, and hurts workers while boosting corporate bottom lines.
