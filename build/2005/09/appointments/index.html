<p>
  New provosts have been named for Kresge College and Merrill College, and the provost at Oakes College has been reappointed for another three-year term.
</p>
<p>
  Micah Perks and Juan Poblete, both associate professors of literature, were appointed to a three-year term as joint provosts at Kresge College. Perks is codirector, with Karen Yamashita, of the Creative Writing Program, which each quarter brings eight to 10 visiting authors and poets into UCSC classrooms. Perks's books include a memoir, <i>Pagan Time: An American Childhood</i> (2001); and a novel of historic fiction, <i>We Are Gathered Here</i> (1996); as well as short stories that have appeared in numerous anthologies and literary magazines. She came to UC Santa Cruz in 1997.
</p>
<p>
  Poblete's focus is on Latin American and U.S. Latino cultures. He is the author of <i>Nineteenth Century Chilean Literature: Between Reading Publics and Authorial Figures</i>, published in Spanish in 2003, and the editor of <i>Critical Latin American and Latino Studies</i> (2003). In 2004 he was a co-organizer of an international conference held at UCSC, "Reflections on the Future: Hemispheric Dialogues on the Intersections of Latina/o-Chicana/o-Latin American(s) Studies." Participants from Chile, Brazil, Puerto Rico, and Argentina were among those attending. Poblete joined the faculty at UC Santa Cruz in 1997.
</p>
<p>
  Lourdes Martinez-Echazabal, associate professor of literature, was appointed to a three-year term as Merrill College provost. Martinez-Echazabal's work examines race and ethnicity in Latin America. She was the author of <i>Para una Semiotica de la Mulatez</i> (Towards a Semiotics of Mulatto Identity) in 1990 and the editor of a special issue of the <i>Afro Hispanic Review</i> in 2005 dedicated to Afro-Cuban writer Manuel Granados. She has published widely on topics pertaining to Latin American and Caribbean literatures; comparative Afro-Latin American literatures; Brazilian literature and cultures; and Latin American women writers. She is the founder and coordinator of the Cuba in Americas and Transatlantic Contexts research cluster at UCSC. She has been on the faculty since 1990.
</p>
<p>
  Pedro Castillo, associate professor of history, has been reappointed to an additional three-year term at Oakes College. Castillo was named by President Clinton in 1999 to serve on the 26-member National Council on the Humanities, the advisory board of the National Endowment for the Humanities. His research interests include Mexican American social history and race, class, and gender in California history. His most recent book is <i>The American Nation</i>, a textbook on American history for use in middle schools. He is very active in the Santa Cruz community and is on the Board of Trustees of the Community Foundation of Santa Cruz County. Castillo has been on the UCSC faculty for nearly 30 years.

  "The other college provosts and I look forward to working with our new colleagues," said William Ladusaw, interim vice provost and dean of undergraduate education, in announcing the appointments. "Their enthusiasm and fresh perspectives will continue the work of their predecessors in renewing the colleges' mission to support undergraduates and enrich the campus educational environment."
