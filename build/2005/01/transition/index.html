  <h1>Chancellor Designate Denton plans to reach out to campus and beyond upon her arrival</h1>

  
  <p class="date">Public Information Department</p>

<p>
  Emphasizing her intent to get to know the campus and the wider UCSC community in as effective a way as possible, Chancellor Designate Denice D. Denton has asked a broadly representative campus group to recommend ways for her to maximize her time during the first weeks after her arrival.<br />
</p>
<p>
  "It is really important to me that I get to know the people of the campus and community," said Denice Denton. "I am happy to dedicate significant time to reaching out in ways that will help me quickly appreciate the aspirations of students, staff, faculty, alumni, and UCSC's many friends and partners--and I will do a lot of listening and expect to garner new ideas and strategies to enhance our campus's positive impact."<br />
</p>
<p>
  To provide this service, a transition team representing students, staff, and faculty has begun evaluating the myriad opportunities and invitations to welcome UCSC's ninth chancellor, after she takes office on February 14.<br />
</p>
<p>
  Considering Chancellor Designate Denton's priority of learning quickly about the challenges and accomplishments of campus members as well as the interests of UCSC's friends and partners, the transition team will identify major events and key issues as well as recommend a schedule of briefings and other activities.<br />
</p>
<p>
  Members of the team are:<br />
  * Jessica Pierce, Student Union Assembly president<br />
  * Kai Pommerenke, Graduate Student Association president<br />
  * Rosemary Anderson, Staff Advisory Board<br />
  * Alison Galloway, professor of anthropology and Academic Senate chair<br />
  * David Kliger, dean of Physical and Biological Sciences and chair of the Council of Deans<br />
  * Gail Hershatter, professor of history and director of the Institute for Humanities Research<br />
  * Nicole Paiement, professor of music<br />
  * Herman Gray, professor and chair of sociology<br />
  * Eugene Switkes, professor of chemistry and member of the President's Advisory Committee to Select a Chancellor<br />
  * Thomas Vani, vice chancellor of Business and Administrative Services<br />
  * Francisco Hernandez, vice chancellor of Student Affairs<br />
  * Ronald P. Suduiko, vice chancellor of University Relations<br />
  * Donna Blitzer, director of Government &amp; Community Relations<br />
</p>
<p>
  Exofficio members of the group are Wiliam Hyder, assistant chancellor, who will serve as chair of the transition team; Elizabeth Irwin, associate vice chancellor of communications; and Judi Hance, assistant to the chancellor.<br />
</p>
<p>
  The existing Executive Budget Committee/Executive Advisory Committee and the Vice Chancellors' Operations group will also serve in a broader consultative and advisory capacity for transition planning.
