<p>
  If the crowds at the Wellness Center are any indication, more than a few members of the campus community have resolved that 2005 will be their year to get in shape.
</p>
<p>
  Fortunately, the Wellness Center is ready to help, whether with a new "Adopt a Slug" exercise program, a walking club, seminars on exercising at home and beginning a fitness routine, and a wealth of online resources.
</p>
<p>
  On January 18, the Wellness Center will begin the "Adopt-A-Fellow Slug Exercise Mentorship Program."
</p>
<p>
  Under the program, regular exercisers will be asked to adopt their nonexercising coworkers or friends on campus and help them establish a regular physical activity routine. If your buddy completes 20 physical activity sessions (minimum 30-minutes each) within eight weeks, both you and your buddy will receive a t-shirt and be entered into a drawing for a new mountain bike. As an added incentive, each buddy will gain free access to the East Field House facilities during the program.
</p>
<p>
  To sign up, <a href="mailto:randrews@ucsc.edu">e-mail</a> Ryan Andrews with your department mailing address to receive an enrollment packet. Those wanting to be adopted as a buddy, or wanting to serve as a mentor should also contact Andrews to be matched with a partner.
</p>
<p>
  Participants are urged to sign up soon so your buddies have more time to complete the program. The last day to begin the mentorship program is February 1.
</p>
<p>
  This program is being sponsored by OPERS, Staff Human Resources, Academic Human Resources, Environmental Health &amp; Safety, Counseling &amp; Psychological Services, and the Odwalla company.
</p>
<p>
  In addition to the exercise buddy program OPERS is holding two seminars on exercise-related topics.
</p>
<p>
  "New Year's Resolutions: Beginning an Exercise Program," is designed for those who may have tried unsuccessfully at various times to begin a fitness program. Seminar topics will include components of a safe fitness routine, strategies for staying consistent, exercise options for those with little free time, and tips for success. The free seminar will be from noon to 1 p.m. on Friday, January 21, in Bay Tree Conference Room D.
</p>
<p>
  "Home/Office Exercise for Busy People," will provide information and demonstrate a quick full-body workout that can be done anywhere. Using your own body weight and simple elastic tubing, the workout will help participants increase strength and flexibility while barely breaking a sweat. The session will be from noon to 1 p.m. on Tuesday, March 8, in Bay Tree Conference Room D. The $15 cost includes an exercise tube and a door anchor.
</p>
<p>
  To sign up for either seminar, <a href="mailto:randrews@ucsc.edu">e-mail</a> or call Andrews at: (831) 459-3970.
</p>
<p>
  Another exercise option gaining popularity is the campus walking club. "Anybody can join and all they have to do is call or <a href="mailto:camori@ucsc.edu">e-mail</a> me and I will put them on the list," said Cindy Mori, an OPERS recreation program instructor who may also be reached by calling (831) 459-5781. "We have about 50 members to date and I'd like it to double by spring. The club is free and there is no catch--it is up to you."
</p>
<p>
  Two walks are done on the west side of campus and two on the east side. Information on times and locations is <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/opers/Wellness/facultyandstaff.html">online.</a> <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/opers/wellness/facultyandstaff.html"></a>
</p>
<p>
  "Our goal is to get as many new and old members walking or doing something as often as they can," Mori said. "Start slow and just go!"
</p>
<p>
  OPERS also has other options for becoming more fit, including:
</p>
<p>
  <b>Pilates class.</b> This smooth, flowing exercise routine is designed to increase core strength, energy and flexibility as well as improve posture. The four-week mat class, aimed at beginner and intermediate students, will be held on Mondays from noon to 1 p.m., Feb. 7-March 7, at the OPERS Activities Room. The cost is $20 with a Wellness Card, or $40 without. ]To sign up, <a href="mailto:randrews@ucsc.edu">e-mail</a> or call Ryan Andrews.
