<p>
  Charles Gary Love, a longtime staff member and UCSC alumnus, died in his Santa Cruz home on Christmas day after a courageous struggle to overcome non-Hodgkins lymphoma. He was 60.
</p>
<p>
  Gary worked in custodial services at UCSC for most of the past 23 years, most recently for Long Marine Lab's Seymour Marine Discovery Center, where his wit and enthusiasm, along with his willingness to go above and beyond what he was paid to do, made him an integral part of the Seymour "team." His illness forced him to take a leave from the job and led to his retirement two months ago.
</p>
<p>
  Gary's association with UCSC began in 1965, when he enrolled as a member of the founding junior-year class. He graduated two years later with a bachelor's in philosophy. A lover of languages and literature, Gary studied German, French, Spanish, Russian, Latin, and ancient Greek. In fact, reading German philosophy inspired Gary to switch his major from German literature to philosophy.
</p>
<p>
  Gary's survivors include his wife, Mary Wells, also a longtime UCSC staff member.
</p>
<p>
  In lieu of flowers, the family suggests donations be made in Gary's name to the Seymour Marine Discovery Center or the Classics Program at UCSC. Checks should be payable to UC Santa Cruz Foundation/Seymour Marine Discover Center or UC Santa Cruz Foundation/Classics Program and mailed to: UC Santa Cruz Foundation, Carriage House, 1156 High Street, Santa Cruz, 95064.
