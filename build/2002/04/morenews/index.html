</h3>
<p>
  If you're looking for fun summer activities for the youngsters in your life, consider the Wildlands and Watering Cans Summer Day Camp at the UCSC Farm. Children ages 7 to 10 are invited to register for week-long sessions filled with hands-on gardening and wilderness activities.
</p>
<p>
  Offered this year by the Life Lab Science Program and the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems, the camp is designed to foster environmental awareness while encouraging children to cooperate and have fun outside. Children will make garden journals, go on bug walks, hike Pogonip, build bird feeders, and do lots more. Campers need to provide their own lunch and water bottle for each day.
</p>
<p>
  Sessions are scheduled for June 24-28, July 8-12, and July 15-19. The curriculum will be repeated each week. Each session will serve 24 campers from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. The ratio of instructors to campers will be 1:6 to allow for close personal instruction. Cost is $150 per session, or $135 for members of the Friends of the UCSC Farm &amp; Garden. Call (831) 459-2001 for more information or to request a registration packet.<br />

  <a name="BAS" id="BAS"></a><font color="#003399">BAS offering one-day seminar on effective interviewing</font>
</h3>
<p>
  Hiring new staff and hiring new faculty are among the most critical activities managers and leaders make on behalf of the university, yet few of us receive training beyond how to avoid legal challenges. Effective Interviewing!(r) is a behavior-based methodology that uses the recognized principle that past and present behavior are the best predictors of future performance.
</p>
<p>
  Participants learn how to define jobs in competency terms and then apply an easy-to-use interview model, which uses high-impact questions to validate candidates' past experiences and predict future job performance. The seminar's interactive format promotes maximum learning with role-play practice, feedback, live and videotape demonstrations. Participants receive a 125-page manual with a set of convenient Pocket Pack review cards and audiocassette.<br />
  <br />
  An Effective Interviewing!(r) seminar will take place at UCSC on Friday, May 10, from 9 a.m. - 4 p.m. The cost is $200 per person. For more information, contact Susan Willats at (831) 459-3759. Register online through the <a href="http://bas.ucsc.edu/dev/events/index.cfm.">BAS Events Manager.</a><br />
