</h3>
<p>
  Harry Berger Jr., professor emeritus of literature and art history, has been named one of Phi Beta Kappa's Visiting Scholars for the 2002-03 year.
</p>
<p>
  In 1956, Phi Beta Kappa established the Visiting Scholar Program to enable chapters to bring distinguished scholars to their campuses. Each year 12 or more scholars are invited to undertake a series of visits to Phi Beta Kappa institutions taking part in the program. The visiting scholar spends two days at each of the institutions he or she visits, participating in classroom lectures and seminars, meeting informally with faculty and student groups, and giving at least one address open to the entire academic community.
</p>
<p>
  In addition, Berger has accepted Smith College's invitation to visit this fall as Kennedy Professor in Renaissance Studies.<br />

<p>
  Bruce Thompson, lecturer in history, has been awarded the first John Dizikes Teaching Award. The Dizikes Award was created by the humanities division to honor outstanding teaching by humanities faculty. In addition to receiving the $3,000 award, the recipient selects a sophomore or junior to receive a $3,000 scholarship. The scholarship is named for the winner of the Dizikes Award.<br />
  <br />
  In announcing the Dizikes Award, dean of humanities Wlad Godzich cited Thompson's intellectual influence on undergraduates and graduates, his commitment to very large numbers of students, and his ability to teach many different topics in history. Thompson was also commended for his skillful use of multimedia, which he integrated into his lectures, and his support and advising of students.<br />
