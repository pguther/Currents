  The pancakes were hot and the jazz was smooth as about 800 UCSC staff members filled Stevenson Dining Hall for the annual Staff Appreciation Breakfast with Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood on May 22.
</p>
<p>Dozens of campus employees won raffle prizes, including cruises on the <i>Chardonnay,</i> bottles of wine, and gift certificates, while everyone received the good news from Greenwood that all eligible employees will get a $200 bonus check June 14 as a “small thank you for all the work you do.”<br />
<br />
Those in attendance enjoyed live jazz by Carne Cruda and a full breakfast that included pancakes, bacon, tofu scramble, homefries, scrambled eggs, fresh fruit, muffins, and biscuits.<br />
<br />
The annual breakfast event is sponsored by the UCSC Staff Advisory Board (SAB). Attendance exceeded expectations, with about 800 people showing up for breakfast, according to University House events coordinator Jeff Rockwell. The event is one of the largest during the academic year for University Dining Services, said catering director Amarylla Hayes, whose staff got to work at 5 a.m. to prepare the breakfast.<br />
<br />
“We’re just happy to see people happy and coming out for breakfast,” said SAB member Karleen Meaker.<br />
<br />
Greenwood presented Meaker and SAB cochair Janelle Marines with certificates of appreciation for the three years they’ve spent on the board.<br />
<br />
The $200 bonuses proposed by Greenwood are intended to “recognize the extraordinary commitment of our staff employees during this difficult time of accelerated campus growth.”</p>
<p>
  Funded by the Award and Recognition Program, bonuses will be distributed June 14 to employees with career, partial-year career, and limited appointments. Awards will be proportionate to each staffer's appointment percentage time in effect on May 1, 2002. Only employees with academic, student, or senior management appointments are excluded.
