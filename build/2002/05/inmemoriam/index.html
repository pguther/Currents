<h2>
  Campus grieves death of Lionel Cantu Jr., 36
</h2>
<p>
  As word on campus spread of the death of Lionel Cantu Jr., friends and colleagues shared their grief and their memories of a young, passionate sociologist who made lasting contributions to sexuality studies and immigration studies.
</p>
<p>Cantu, an assistant professor of sociology, died unexpectedly on Sunday, May 26, at the age of 36. Cantu had been hospitalized after suffering a ruptured intestine earlier in the week. The cause of death was cardiac arrest, said Patricia Zavella, professor of Latin American and Latino studies.</p>
<p>
  "We can't believe this has happened. It's a complete shock to all of us," said Zavella, who was at Cantu's bedside much of the week. "It's such a loss."
</p>
<p>
  A memorial service was scheduled for Tuesday, May 28, at noon at Holy Cross Church in Santa Cruz. A viewing was scheduled for 7 p.m. May 28 at Santa Cruz Memorial Park &amp; Funeral Home in Santa Cruz.
</p>
<p>
  In sociology, Cantu specialized in the ways in which sexuality influences migration. His dissertation, "Border Crossings: Mexican Men and the Sexuality of Migration," focused on Mexican men who have sex with men, and how sexual identity changes in different cultural contexts.
</p>
<p>
  His other interests included race and ethnicity, and Latinos in the U.S. He joined the UCSC faculty in 1999 from UC Irvine, where he earned his Ph.D. in social science. He received a UC President's Doctoral Fellowship and spent the 1999-2000 year as a UC Davis postdoctoral researcher, studying how American gay culture was becoming globalized and commodified.
</p>
<p>
  Sociology professor Candace West, a colleague and friend, said<br />
  Cantu brought a sense of community to the Sociology Department and shared a "joy of living" with his associates, including students, with whom he had a special connection.
</p>
<p>
  "He was probably responsible for more students hanging on and triumphing--getting their Ph.D.s--than any other faculty member, certainly for Chicano and Latino students," said West. "He was a mainstay."
</p>
<p>
  Cantu and Zavella had recently submitted a proposal to the National Institutes of Health for a four-year, cross-border study on HIV risk among Mexican migrants. They planned to assess the risks among migrants in the Silicon Valley and Monterey Bay areas, as well as in the regions around Cuernavaca and Guadalajara in Mexico, said Zavella.
</p>
<p>
  "We were going to look at how location affects sexual behavior and risk taking," she said. "It was a great project that was going to combine his expertise on gay immigrant men and mine on immigrant women. He was pretty excited about it."
</p>
<p>
  At the time of his death, Cantu was revising his dissertation for publication and was collaborating with Eithne Lubheid on an edited anthology, "Queer Moves: Sexuality, Migration, and the Contested Boundaries of U.S. Citizenship," about the queer migrants in the U.S and how they have transformed notions of queerness, racialization, migration, and citizenship.
</p>
<p>
  "His intellectual and social home really was the Chicano/Latino Research Center," said Zavella. "He was a real core member. We all loved his wonderful sense of humor and his plans for expanding our undergraduate apprenticeship program."
</p>
<p>
  Earlier this year, Cantu was awarded a 2002-03 postdoctoral research fellowship from the International Migration Program of the Social Science Research Council. Established in 1923, the SSRC is an independent, nongovernmental organization that supports social science research, education, and scholarly exchange.
</p>
<p>
  Among his publications are "<i>De Ambiente</i>: Queer Tourism and the Shifting Boundaries of Mexican Male Sexualities," an article that appeared earlier this year in <i>GLQ: A Journal of Lesbian and Gay Studies</i>; "The Peripheralization of Rural America: A Case Study of Latino Migrants in America's Heartland," which appeared in the journal <i>Sociological Perspectives</i>; and "Responses to Persons with AIDS: Fear of Contagion or Stigma?," which appeared in the journal <i>Applied Social Psychology</i>.
</p>
<p>
  In 1998, Cantu was named UC Irvine Lauds &amp; Laurels Outstanding Graduate Student. From 1993 until his graduation in 1999, Cantu was cochair of the UCI Lesbian and Gay Faculty/Staff Network, and he was instrumental in founding the Lilac Collective, a speaker series on sexuality studies. He earned a bachelor's degree in psychology and Spanish from the University of Texas at San Antonio in 1991. He earned his doctorate in social science with emphases in social relations and feminist studies.
</p>
<p>
  Cantu is survived by his life partner, Hernando Molinares, of Santa Cruz; parents Rosario and Lionel Cantu, of San Antonio; sisters Rose Louise and Rachel Diane Cantu, both of San Antonio; a brother, Charles Cantu, of San Antonio; and a grandmother, Herlinda Reyes.
</p>
<p>
  At the family's request, an endowed scholarship is being created to honor Cantu. Contributions should be made payable to the UC Santa Cruz Foundation, with Cantu's name in the memo line, and sent to:
