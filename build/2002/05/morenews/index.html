<p>The Art Department will be holding the 28th Annual Student Print Sale on Friday, May 31, and Saturday, June 1, from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. in the Printmaking Studio, Room G-101, at Baskin Visual Arts.

  Hundreds of original etchings, lithographs, woodcuts, and handmade books by students will be displayed. All work will be for sale, with proceeds benefiting the individual artists as well as the printmaking program at UCSC. This extraordinary display and sale of original prints is also a great opportunity to become acquainted with the professional quality of the printmaking program and studio facilities at UCSC. The event is free and open to the public. Come browse or buy (prices usually range between $5 and $50). For more information, call Veda Ozelle at the Printmaking Studio, (831) 459-3686.<br />

</h3>
<p>The 2002 NCAA Division III Men’s Tennis Championships, hosted by four-time champion UCSC, concluded on the East Field courts Wednesday with the singles final.<br />
<br />
Josh Lefkowitz of Williams College, who had lost in each of the past three years to the eventual champion, finally claimed the prize that had eluded him, beating Kevin Whipple of Gustavus Adolphus in three sets (6-3, 2-6, 6-1).<br />
<br />
In the team competition concluded Sunday (May 19), UCSC–which finished first in 1989 and three more times in the 1990s–took fourth, while Williams repeated as team champions. UCSC lost to Williams in an exciting semifinal match, 4-3.<br />
<br />
In the doubles championship, also concluded on Wednesday, John Cham-a-Koon and Ivan Yeh of Claremont-Mudd-Scripps defeated Kyle Harding and Jeff Keen of Kalamazoo (6-4, 6-2).</p>

  <a name="UC" id="UC"></a><font color="#003399">UC, nurses reach tentative agreement</font>
</h3>
<p>
  <font color="#00000F">After several months of negotiations, the University of California and the California Nurses Association reached a tentative agreement May 24 regarding a new three-year contract for UC's 8,000 nurses.<br />
  <br />
  On Wednesday, the university had presented the union with an offer designed to conclude negotiations. Among other things, it required that the union cancel its planned May 29 strike and drop its charges of unfair practices. While still preserving the university's ability to financially reward performance through lump-sum awards, the proposal also stipulated that UC would eliminate its use of merit pay for nurses, a key union issue. The tentative agreement is set for ratification June 3.</font> <a href="http://www.ucop.edu/news/archives/2002/may28art1.htm">Full text of UC press release</a>; <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/messages/01-02/05-28.canceled.html">message from UCSC Vice Chancellor Tom Vani</a><br />
