  <h1>Academic Senate to meet on May 17</h1>

  
  <p class="date">Public Information Office</p>
  

  <p>
  The UCSC Academic Senate will meet at 3 p.m. on Friday, May 17, in Earth and Marine Sciences B206. George Blumenthal, chair of the Academic Senate, sent a letter to senate members outlining some of the key issues coming up. The letter is below:
</p>
<p>
  "This year, the work of Senate committees has been dominated by planning for change. It has become evident that how we manage growth on this campus will determine the type of university we will be in ten years as well as the nature and quality of our academic programs. This call presents the current thinking of several committees to date on enrollment growth and management. The report of the Committee on Admissions and Financial Aid sets out the initial requirements for a comprehensive admissions review, which CAFA will be developing next year. The report from CPB on enrollment management lays out 14 concise recommendations to facilitate coordination of planning and implementation of enrollment targets that include the target of 15 percent graduate enrollment passed as a resolution at the winter quarter Senate meeting. Of special interest to all faculty is CPB's Interim report on the campus 10-year planning process. It assesses this very complex process and suggests new structures for supporting proposals arising out of the divisional plans. I urge you to read these reports.<br />
  <br />
  The Senate Advisory Committee is proposing several revisions to the Bylaws, which are intended to improve the efficiency and professionalism of Senate meetings and operations.<br />
  <br />
  Each year, the Senate has an opportunity to honor one of our colleagues for research accomplishments. This year, we have an outstanding nominee for the Faculty Research Lecture, which the Division is asked to confirm.<br />
  <br />
  In addition, the Committee on Committees is proposing a nominee for the Dean McHenry Service Award for outstanding service to the Academic Senate. COC is also proposing a slate of nominees to Senate committees for confirmation. I believe that our Senate committees have done an excellent job this year, and I have come to an ever greater appreciation of the positive impact that Senate committees have on the activities of the campus as a whole.<br />
  <br />
  After the meeting, Chancellor Greenwood and I hope that all faculty and their guests will attend a reception to be held in the foyer of the Earth and Marine Sciences Building. This will be an opportunity to celebrate our collective accomplishments during the 2001-2002 academic year. I hope to see you all there."
