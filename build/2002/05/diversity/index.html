  <h1>Diversity Fund Program gears up for next year</h1>

  
  <p class="date">Jennifer McNulty</p>
  

  <p>
  A program designed to increase the educational diversity of the campus is gearing up for its second year. The Diversity Fund Program was established in 2001 at Campus Provost John Simpson's behest to help academic departments diversify the applicant pools for particular ladder-rank searches and to improve the graduate student pipeline.
</p>
<p>
  Ten awards totaling $15,400 were made to several departments during the program's first funding cycle, according to Barbara Brogan of Academic Human Resources. Several departments, including Environmental Toxicology; Chemistry and Biochemistry; Ecology and Evolutionary Biology; and Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology, joined together to hire a biologist to advise them on how to attract more diverse applicant pools.
</p>
<p>
  In Applied Math and Statistics, as well as Computer Science, the award helped sponsor colloquia. In Computer Engineering, the award supplemented funding from the National Science Foundation to help undergraduates prepare for graduate school, which will eventually increase the diversity of the pipeline leading to faculty positions. Other departments that received awards include Literature, Electrical Engineering, Women's Studies, Psychology, Community Studies, and Politics, said Brogan.<br />
  <br />
  More information about the <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/ahr/divfund.htm">Diversity Fund Program,</a> including applications for 2002-03 funding, is available <a href="http://senate.ucsc.edu/caa/index.html">online</a>. The deadline for next year's awards is October 15. Awards of up to $2,000 will be announced after selections are made, said Brogan.<br />
  <br />
  Funds may supplement existing programs, while other initiatives might include developing curricula that deal with diversity issues, funding programs that encourage all students--including women and underrepresented minorities--to apply to doctoral programs, sponsoring colloquia that bring potential applicants, including women and minorities, to campus, funding search committee members attendance at conferences to recruit and interview candidates, and establishing interdisciplinary projects that promote diversity. In addition, awards may help supplement recruitment costs, subsidize second visits of serious candidates, or boost startup funds for top candidates whose research, teaching, or service contributes to the educational diversity of the campus, Brogan noted.
