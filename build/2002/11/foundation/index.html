  <h1>UCSC Foundation hosts inaugural lecture by David Hamburg</h1>

  
  <p class="date">Jennifer McNulty</p>
  

  <p>
  David Hamburg, president emeritus of the Carnegie Corporation of New York, will deliver a lecture entitled "Preventing Deadly Conflict," on Thursday, November 21, at 4 p.m. in the Colleges Nine and Ten Dining Hall. The event is open to the campus community--faculty, staff, students, and affiliates.<br />
</p>
<p>
  Hamburg, a leading voice on international security issues and science policy, is the author of the new book <i>No More Killing Fields: Preventing Deadly Conflict,</i> in which he examines the September 11 terrorist attacks and the eruption of civil and regional wars to show the ineffectiveness of Cold War-era policies. Hamburg calls on the international community to prevent conflict by improving economic conditions in unstable countries.
</p>
<p>
  Hamburg's appearance is the inaugural Foundation Forum, a new biannual lecture series presented by Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood and the UC Santa Cruz Foundation Board of Trustees. His remarks will be followed by a panel discussion with a UCSC student and UCSC professors Paul Lubeck of sociology and Nirvikar Singh of economics. UCSC Foundation Trustee and former mayor of San Jose Susan Hammer will moderate the panel.
</p>
<p>
  "This new Foundation Forum series will bring together Foundation trustees, faculty, and students," said Greenwood. "We'll bring engaging speakers to campus who will help us explore the topics of the day." Forum events will be presented in conjunction with the Foundation's twice-yearly meetings.
</p>
<p>
  A physician, Hamburg has long been concerned with the problems of human aggression and violence. He was a member of the United States Defense Policy Board and cochair of the Carnegie Commission on Preventing Deadly Conflict. He was a member of President Clinton's Committee of Advisors on Science and Technology and is the founder of the Carnegie Commission on Science, Technology, and Government.
</p>
<p>
  He was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom at the White House in 1996, the International Peace Academy's 25th Anniversary Special Award in 1996, and the National Academy of Sciences' Public Welfare Medal in 1998. He is a current member of the National Academy of Sciences, the Institute of Medicine, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
</p>
<p>
  Organized in 1974, the UC Santa Cruz Foundation is a nonprofit corporation that promotes greater community understanding of UCSC and solicits gifts that support the campus's academic programs, scholarships, and capital improvement projects.
