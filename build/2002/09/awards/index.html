</p>
<p>
  Jonathan Fox, professor and chair of Latin American and Latino studies, was honored recently for his work with indigenous Oaxacans. The Binational Oaxaca Indigenous Front (FIOB) presented him with a plaque and a symbolic staff of responsibility ("Baston de mando"). Presented in August during the group's annual cultural exchange festival, the plaque reads, in Spanish: "The Binational Oaxaca Indigenous Front recognizes Dr. Jonathan Fox for his unconditional support for the creation of binational projects to benefit indigenous Oaxacan migrants and non-migrants."<br />
</p>
<p>
  The FIOB is a civic group that supports immigrant rights, indigenous rights, and community development. It supports Oaxacans in their hometowns in Mexico, as well as those who migrate to California. Fox has worked with the group for four years as part of his ongoing research on Mexican rural development policy.
