<p>
  Building on its strengths addressing the needs of a diverse population, the UCSC Education Department will begin accepting graduate students into a new doctoral program that begins in fall 2003.
</p>
<p>
  The Ph.D. in education was approved this summer by UC President Richard Atkinson. The review committee cited UCSC's leadership in the needs of K-12 students from nondominant linguistic and cultural groups.
</p>
<p>
  The new program will offer three specializations: language and literacy; mathematics and science education; and social context of education. The program will offer a multidisciplinary approach, drawing on theories of learning and teaching from anthropology, psychology, sociology, and sociolinguistics.
</p>
<p>
  "This new program rounds out our offerings and enables us to prepare students for careers in all aspects of education, from classroom teaching to administration and research," said Joyce Justus, chair of UCSC's Education Department. The department offers undergraduates the opportunity to minor in education; a 15-month combined master's and teaching credential; and now the doctoral degree.
</p>
<p>
  Initial enrollment of six to eight Ph.D. students will grow to 32 students after four years, said Justus. Some candidates will likely be drawn from the approximately 150 students in the master's in education program currently offered by the department, she added.
</p>
<p>
  The new Ph.D. program addresses a projected need for new doctorates in the field of education, who will be competitive candidates for positions in UC and Cal State University teacher education programs, other universities, state and federal government policy offices, and educational research centers. Within the UC system, 25 openings for education doctorates are anticipated each year through 2010. Further analysis suggests that approximately 100 new CSU tenure-track faculty hires in education will be recent UC Ph.D.s by the year 2010.
</p>
<p>
  Five other UC campuses offer a Ph.D. in education: Berkeley, Davis, Los Angeles, Riverside, and Santa Barbara.
</p>
<p>
  Justus and other Education Department faculty are also currently engaged in talks with San Jose State University about developing an Education Doctorate program. An Ed.D. program would fill a niche by preparing students for positions of educational leadership, said Justus. The collaboration responds to UC President Atkinson's eagerness to build bridges between UC and CSU campuses.
