</p>
<p>
  Recognized as a national expert in science and education policy, Chancellor Greenwood testified before the U.S. Congress House Science Committee earlier this month on the challenges facing research universities during the war on terrorism.<br />
</p>
<p>
  Greenwood delivered her remarks, titled "Conducting Research During the War on Terrorism: Balancing Openness and Security," during an October 10 hearing.<br />
</p>
<p>
  The chancellor stressed that universities must continue to play a critical role in understanding and preventing terrorism in the next generation. In order to do so, she added, it is essential to balance requirements for increased security with the freedoms of American academia that have resulted in enormous benefits to our society. <a href="http://www.house.gov/science/hearings/full02/oct10/greenwood.htm">Full text of Chancellor Greenwood's remarks</a><br />

  <span class="sectionhead"><a name="handbook" id="handbook"></a>New Administrative Responsibilities Handbook now available</span>
</p>
<p>
  The Campus Controller's Office has prepared a new <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/finaff/cc/ARH/Htoc.htm">Administrative Responsibilities Handbook</a>. The handbook provides a concise reference for anyone on campus with administrative responsibilities, which can range from complying with sponsored research administrative requirements to having the authority to approve the acquisition of goods and services. It is not meant to be a detailed compendium of procedures, but rather it serves as a guide to where additional assistance and guidance in addressing administrative matters can be obtained.<br />
</p>
<p>
  The handbook is modeled after a similar handbook produced by the UC San Diego campus and has been in development for more than two years. Assistant Controller Vicki Gutzwiller played a key role in coordinating this effort.
</p>
<p>
  The handbook is being distributed to all individuals on the campus with administrative management responsibilities. For more information, call Vicki Gutzwiller at (831) 459-3206.<br />
