  <h1>Three UCSC professors elected AAAS Fellows</h1>

  
  <p class="date">Tim Stephens</p>
  

  <p>
  Three UCSC professors have been awarded the distinction of AAAS Fellow by the American Association for the Advancement of Science. They are David Haussler, professor of computer science; David Kliger, professor of chemistry and biochemistry and dean of the Division of Natural Sciences; and Marc Mangel, professor of applied mathematics and statistics.<br />
  <br />
  Election as a fellow of AAAS is an honor bestowed on members of the association by their peers. Awarded to 291 members this year, the honor recognizes members for their efforts to advance science or foster applications that are deemed scientifically or socially distinguished. New fellows will be presented with an official certificate and a gold and blue rosette pin on Saturday, February 15, at the Fellows Forum during the 2003 AAAS Annual Meeting in Denver, Colorado.<br />
  <br />
  As part of the AAAS section on statistics, Haussler was elected AAAS Fellow for his assembly and analysis of the working draft of the human genome and for the development of statistical algorithms for bioinformatics and other fields. Haussler holds a UC Presidential Chair in Computer Science and is a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator.<br />
  <br />
  As part of the section on chemistry, Kliger was recognized for his distinguished contributions to the study of dynamic changes in protein and chromophore interactions with light, and also for his contributions to senior administration in science. Kliger has maintained an active research laboratory while serving as dean of natural sciences for the past 12 years.<br />
  <br />
  As part of the section on biological sciences, Mangel was cited for his distinguished contributions to quantitative ecology and mathematical biology, particularly behavioral ecology and theoretical applied ecology. One of his main areas of research involves quantitative issues in fisheries management.<br />
  <br />
  Founded in 1848, the AAAS has worked to advance science for human well-being through its projects, programs, and publications. The association publishes the journal <i>Science.</i>
