  <h1>Proposed education bond includes more than $40 million for UCSC</h1>

  
  <p class="date">Louise Donahue</p>
  

  <p>
  A proposed $13.05 billion education bond facing voters this November includes money for several major UCSC projects. If passed, the Kindergarten-University Public Education Facilities Bond Act would provide more than $40 million over two years, with about $2 million the first year.
</p>
<p>
  The bond is listed as Proposition 47 on the November 5 ballot.
</p>
<p>
  "This bond measure is extremely important to all segments of education--and it is crucial for UC Santa Cruz. I urge everyone to be informed and to vote," said Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood.
</p>
<p>
  In the first year, the bond would provide almost $1.5 million for planning the long-sought UCSC Humanities and Social Sciences Facility, and $517,000 to plan the Emergency Response Center.
</p>
<p>
  In the second year, the bond would provide:<br />
  <br />
  * $25,826,000 for working drawings and construction of the Humanities and Social Sciences Facility.<br />
</p>
<p>
  * $6,592,000 for working drawings and construction of the Emergency Response Center.<br />
  <br />
  * $396,000 for working drawings and construction for alterations for Engineering, Phase 2.<br />
</p>
<p>
  * $3 million for working drawings and construction of seismic corrections, Phase 2A.<br />
</p>
<p>
  * $1,906,000 for McHenry Library Addition planning, Phase 1, as well as $682,000, for seismic and ADA improvement planning; $519,000 for fire and life safety improvements/Library renovations planning; and $495,000 for renovation/Library addition completion planning.
</p>
<p>
  Overall, the bond would provide public higher education--the University of California, California State University, and the state's community colleges--with $1.65 billion. UC's portion would be $408.2 million, CSU would get $496 million, and the community colleges, $746 million.
</p>
<p>
  UC would use Proposition 47 funds for capital improvements in three areas:
</p>
<p>
  * <b>Earthquake safety and life safety.</b> The bond would help UC make seismic repairs in classroom, laboratory, and office buildings.
</p>
<p>
  * <b>More space for enrollment growth.</b> An increase of 64,000 additional students is expected by 2010, creating a need for major new facilities and programs.
</p>
<p>
  * <b>Modernization.</b> Outdated infrastructure and aging classroom and laboratory buildings would be targeted for modernization.
</p>
<p>
  Kindergarten through high school education would receive $11.4 billion, with $3.3 billion going to repair and upgrade schools and about $8.10 billion directed to new construction to relieve overcrowding and provide added space for new students.
</p>
<p>
  In Santa Cruz County, the bond would provide a total of $64.9 million for education when K-12 and higher education are combined.
</p>
<p>
  Proposition 47's supporters include the UC Board of Regents, California State PTA, California Teachers Association, California Taxpayers Association, California Chamber of Commerce, and the League of Women Voters.
</p>
<p>
  An opposition campaign has not been organized, but state Senator William J. "Pete" Knight; Jon Coupal, president of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association; and Lewis K. Uhler, president of the National Tax Limitation Committee, signed the ballot argument opposing Proposition 47 in the Official Voter Information Guide.
</p>
<p>
  Arguments in favor and against the bond are available <a href="http://voterguide.ss.ca.gov/propositions2.asp?id=225&amp;sID=3">online</a> and in the voter guide. Information is also available at the University of California Office of the President <a href="http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/prop47.html">web site.</a>
</p>
<p>
  Another bond issue, providing an additional $2.3 billion for higher education--including $690 million for UC and $39.4 million for UCSC--is tentatively scheduled to go before voters in 2004, if this measure passes.
