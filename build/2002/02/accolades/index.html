  <font color="#003399"><b>Manuel Pastor honored as 'civic entrepreneur'</b></font>
</h3>
<p>Manuel Pastor, a professor of Latin American and Latino studies, has been named the volunteer Civic Entrepreneur of the Year by the California Center for Regional Leadership.<br />
<br />
Pastor, director of UCSC’s Center for Justice, Tolerance, and Community, is a leader of the movement to forge regional solutions to societal problems. His book, <a href="http://www.upress.umn.edu/Books/P/pastor_regions.html"><i>Regions That Work: How Cities and Suburbs Can Grow Together</i></a> (Univ. of Minn. Press), coauthored with Peter Dreier, Eugene Grigsby, and Marta Lopez-Garza, is a pioneering work in the field.<br />
<br />
A widely recognized scholar of Latin American and U.S. urban issues, Pastor is also a dedicated community activist and an effective policy adviser. He has done extensive “solution-oriented research” in Los Angeles, studying community organizing and economic development in the city’s poor neighborhoods.<br />
<br />
Pastor has collaborated with Communities for a Better Environment to study and strategize for environmental justice in low-income communities of color. He has also teamed up with San Jose-based Working Partnerships USA, a labor-supported think tank that does research on the changing economy, to compare aspects of Silicon Valley’s “new economy” to the “old” rust-belt economy of metropolitan Milwaukee. He serves on the Advisory Council of the Public Policy Institute of California and served as a board member of the Silicon Valley Civic Action Network.<br />
<br />
“His dedication and effectiveness as a community activist working in the poor neighborhoods of Los Angeles and elsewhere around the state is well-known and admired by civic entrepreneurs all over California,” said the announcement. The award was presented in January.<br />
<br />
The California Center for Regional Leadership (CCRL) is a San Francisco-based statewide nonprofit organization established to support and promote innovative regional solutions to major economic, environmental, and societal challenges. The group also presented a professional Civic Entrepreneur of the Year Award to Carol Whiteside, founder and president of the Great Valley Center, a nonprofit organization committed to building support for California’s Central Valley. The awards are sponsored by the Morgan Family Foundation.<br />
