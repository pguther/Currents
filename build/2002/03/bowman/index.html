<p>
  Barry Bowman, professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology, has been honored by the Division of Natural Sciences with the Outstanding Faculty Award for 2000-01. The award recognizes Bowman's distinguished research career, commitment to service, and excellence as a teacher.
</p>
<p>“Dr. Bowman is an internationally known and highly respected scientist who is held in high regard for his excellence in research, teaching, and service. He truly is an important asset to our campus and to the Division of Natural Sciences,” said David Kliger, dean of natural sciences, in announcing the award.<br />
<br />
Bowman is an expert on the specialized proteins that transport molecules across biological membranes. His research has focused on one such transporter in particular, known as the vacuolar ATPase of the fungus <i>Neurospora crassa.</i></p>
<p>
  The vacuolar ATPase is a large, complex enzyme that generates an electrochemical gradient by pumping protons across the membrane of a cellular compartment called the vacuole.
</p>
<p>
  It has an amazing mechanism, coupling the movement of protons to the function of a rotary motor that spins at 10,000 rpm. Bowman's lab has characterized the structure and function of this enzyme in great detail.<br />
  <br />
  Bowman is recognized both nationally and internationally as a leader in his field and is regularly invited to speak at symposia around the world. A major grant from the National Institutes of Health has supported his research program for 20 years.<br />
  <br />
  Bowman's teaching abilities have also earned him praise from both undergraduates and graduate students. He consistently receives outstanding evaluations from his students, who commend his patience, humor, receptivity to questions, clarity, availability, and commitment to student learning. He is often referred to as "the best lecturer I've ever had." In 1999-2000, Bowman was chosen to receive the UCSC Alumni Association's Distinguished Teaching Award, the highest honor the association gives to UCSC faculty.<br />
  <br />
  Kliger also noted Bowman's exemplary record of service to the university and to his profession. "He provided extraordinary leadership as chair of the Biology Department and has gained the respect and admiration of many biology faculty members," Kliger said.<br />
  <br />
  Bowman has served as director of the NIH-funded Minority Biomedical Research Support (MBRS) program at UCSC since 1989. He has also served on numerous committees for his department and for the Academic Senate. He has served on the NIH Physical Biochemistry Study Section and is called on regularly to review grant proposals for them. He also routinely reviews 10 to 12 manuscripts annually for the editorial boards of various scientific journals.<br />
  <br />
  The Outstanding Faculty Award was established by the Division of Natural Sciences in 1993. Each year, a committee of divisional department chairs selects the award recipient. The annual award honors excellence in research, teaching, and service to the campus and the community.
