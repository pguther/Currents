</p>
<p>
  Twenty eight non-Senate academics and 100 staff members were winners in UCSC's first housing lottery.<br />
</p>
<p>
  Before the names were drawn in a Merrill Dining Hall ceremony on July 15, Faculty and Staff Housing manager Steve Houser noted that 252 applications were received. Of those, 10 were found to be ineligible and 11 withdrew their names from consideration. Of the remaining 231, Houser said, 203 were staff members.<br />
</p>
<p>
  Initial plans called for drawing the names of 50 staff members and 15 nonsenate academics, but Houser announced that the numbers would be doubled to give current employees a better chance of getting a spot. That meant that all the non-Senate academics who applied made the list.<br />
</p>
<p>
  The housing most likely to be available soon is in Hagar Court, where apartments are being converted to condominiums. Fifty units are expected to be ready during 2003.<br />
</p>
<p>
  Additional information on housing for sale is available from the <a href="http://www.housing.ucsc.edu/housing/forsale.html">Faculty and Staff Housing Office</a> web site and from earlier <a href="http://currents.ucsc.edu/03-04/07-07/housing.html">Currents stories.</a><i><br /></i><a href="#housing"><i>back to top</i></a>

  <a name="tour" id="tour"></a>Third-graders tour Fackler Cogeneration Plant
</p>
<p>
  Third graders from Spring Hill School came to campus recently to tour the Fackler Cogeneration Plant as part of their study of power generation. They were the first elementary school group to visit the facility.
</p>
<p>
  The students were accompanied by their teacher, Jennifer Riddle, who arranged the tour with Rachel Huff, business coordinator for Building and Utility Services.
</p>
<p>
  Mark Sine, a Cogen engine specialist, took the children around the plant, showing them the switchgear, which operates the campus electrical grid; the campus boilers, which heat the water for heating the core campus buildings; and the Cogen engine, which provides power to two-third's of the campus, in parallel with PG&amp;E.
</p>
<p>
  Sine answered tough questions from the students, including, What is PG&amp;E?; What is that phone (the intercom between campus substations) for?; What are the radios for?; and, Are we getting earplugs?
</p>
<p>
  The students each left with their earplugs and a packet of UCSC souvenirs assembled especially for them by Jim West, senior superintendent of Building and Utility Services.<br />
