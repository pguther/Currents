  <h1>Summer Session offering more special-interest courses</h1>

<p>
  Things may be quieting down on the rest of the campus, but Summer Session planners have gone into overdrive, preparing for another record enrollment.
</p>
<p>
  An estimated 3,500 students are expected for Summer Session, about 15 percent more than last year, said Pat Vani, Summer Session director.
</p>
<p>
  That increase in students adds up to a wider array of courses. "We're offering more courses, so there are more choices," Vani said.<br />
</p>
<p>
  Among those courses are three new short courses focusing on special areas of interest.<br />
</p>
<p>
  The shortest of the short courses is <i>British Literature 130G,</i> an intensive week focusing on author Charles Dickens. Students will spend a week of 12-hour days participating in the annual <a href="http://humwww.ucsc.edu:16080/dickens/index.html">Dickens Project</a>, July 27-August 1 and may receive five units of credit.<br />
</p>
<p>
  A three-week workshop on algorithmic computer music is led by David Cope, a composer and UCSC professor of music. Participants will take classes on the basic techniques of algorithmic composition and analysis. The three-week program begins June 23.<br />
</p>
<p>
  <i>Number, Area, Space, Time, and Motion,</i> also known as <i>Math 108,</i> delves into the history of numbers and other concepts. Taught by Professor Anthony Tromba and running from July 14 to 31, the course is designed for teachers and prospective teachers.<br />
</p>
<p>
  "We can do a few things out of the norm in the summer," said Vani. "The faculty is getting more interested in trying something different, especially specialty courses, over the summer."<br />
</p>
<p>
  Last year, an online course, <i>Computer Science 185: Technical Writing for Computer Engineers,</i> was introduced. The course's success (see earlier <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/currents/02-03/10-14/online_course.html">Currents story</a>) led to a doubling of enrollment this year, and there is now a waiting list for the class. Students in the course must appear in class just twice--at the beginning and the end of the course. "The rest is done online," Vani said. "It enables them to be anywhere in the world, really."<br />
</p>
<p>
  That flexibility has special appeal during the summer, when students are trying to fit classes around jobs and other commitments. "There are a limited number of classes that would work that way," Vani said, adding that she'd be happy to offer more.<br />
</p>
<p>
  While some students are taking a class online, many more are taking advantage of registration online. Students may register online at the Summer Session <a href="http://summer.ucsc.edu/">web site</a> with a credit card.<br />
</p>
<p>
  Online registration began at midnight on March 10, "and the first registration came through at 12:03," Vani said. "It's been very popular and convenient. This works with their schedules better and cuts back on paperwork for us," she said.
