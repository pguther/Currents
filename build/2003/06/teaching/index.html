<p>
  Ten faculty members and 12 graduate students have received Excellence in Teaching Awards for 2002-03.<br />
</p>
<p>
  Winners of the awards, for those who have demonstrated exemplary and inspiring teaching, were selected by the UCSC Academic Senate Committee on Teaching.<br />
</p>
<p>
  Nominations for the annual honor are submitted by students, and the committee also reads a statement on teaching written by the nominee, as well as a letter from the department chair. The committee looks for evidence that the nominee has thought deeply about teaching and learning, and effectively applies that thinking in the classroom.<br />
</p>
<p>
  This year's awards were presented by Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood and Committee on Teaching Chair Judith Habicht-Mauche on May 23 at University House. Their names were also announced during the final Academic Senate meeting of the 2002-03 academic year, on May 16.<br />
