  The <a href="http://www.frazadelic.com/aatat03.htm">African-American Theater Arts Troupe</a>, now in its twelfth year, will delve into American history in the postwar period with several performances of <i>Seven Guitars,</i> by noted African American writer <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/%7Eawilson/bio.html">August Williams.</a> The play takes audiences on a journey through the lives of seven African Americans in a Pittsburgh, Pa., back yard.<br />
</p>
<p>
  "It's a re-creation of life in 1948," said director Don Williams, Theater Arts Center Facilities Supervisor. "You'll discover who these people are--their good times and their bad times."<br />

  An art showing by <a href="http://www.justinbua.com">Justin Bua</a> will start off the celebration from 7:30 to 9:30 p.m. on Thursday, February 20, at Media Arts.

Saturday's activities include a Step Show and Dance from 9 p.m. to 1 a.m. at Stevenson Dining Hall. "During slavery, when drums were discouraged or prohibited, African Americans responded by using their bodies as drums: clapping, slapping the hands against different parts of the body, stomping the feet, to produce a rhythmic foundation for dance," organizers of the weekend events noted. "Since the mid-twentieth century, African American fraternities and sororities have incorporated these historical roots with popular artistic forms: call and response, military drills, cheerleading, acrobatics, hip hop dance, and tap dance, to develop the art of stepping." Fraternities and sororities from UCSC and nearby universities have been invited to compete. After the step show, the crowd is invited to stay and dance.
