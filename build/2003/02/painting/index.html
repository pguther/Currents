<p>
  Congressman Sam Farr formally donated a painting from renowned Cuban artist Aguedo Alonso to UCSC's Special Collections in a ceremony held February 18 at the new University Center.
</p>
<p>
  The painting was originally given to Farr as a personal gift by Cuban president Fidel Castro. Farr had traveled to Cuba with a delegation of Californians to work toward improving relations with the country.<br />
</p>
<p>
  "We were invited to Sunday-night dinner with Castro," Farr recalled. "After showing me his office in the presidential palace, we walked into the foyer and we saw four paintings by famous artists. He told me that last week, President Vicente Fox of Mexico had come to Cuba and Fox chose a painting to take home with him. He then asked, 'would you like one?'"<br />
</p>
<p>
  Farr told Castro that due to congressional rules, he was not permitted to accept a gift. But when the Cuban president asked if he could take the painting to give to a museum or university, Farr quickly agreed.<br />
</p>
<p>
  The artist has been described as "one of the indispensables of contemporary Cuban painting" by historian Eusebio Leal. Alonso is regarded as one of the leading proponents of the school of landscape painting that was developed in his native province of Pinar del Rio. His work is considered to be a tribute to nature and the need to preserve it.<br />
</p>
<p>
  Alonso's paintings have been featured in exhibitions throughout Cuba, as well as in more than 60 countries in the Americas, Europe, and Asia. His work is part of the collection of the Museo Nacional de Arte Plasticas de Cuba, and can be found in museums and galleries in Belgium, Denmark, the Czech Republic, Spain, Poland, Switzerland, and Portugal.<br />
</p>
<p>
  "It's a great honor to have the painting at UCSC," noted Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood, "and it's a wonderful new addition to Special Collections."<br />
</p>
<p>
  Farr is cofounder of a group in Congress--made up of 11 Republicans and 11 Democrats--that is working to change U.S. laws to lift embargoes on trade and travel. He observed that tourism is the biggest industry in Cuba today, and that the United States is the only country that does not allow tourists to visit.<br />
</p>
<p>
  "A hundred thousand American tourists went to Cuba last year," Farr pointed out. "Seventy-five thousand went illegally, through Mexico and other countries."<br />
</p>
<p>
  He noted that the U.S. Treasury Department will only issue an exemption or license to nonprofit organizations and educational institutions for cultural exchanges.<br />
</p>
<p>
  "I found Cuba to be friendly and safe," Farr said. "It's never burned an American flag. It's never injured an American. Yet we call it a terrorist country....and frankly, I don't know why. But we're starting to break down the barriers. Fidel is very proud of the culture of Cuba."
</p>
<p>
  The congressman added that he was returning to Cuba the following weekend with a nationally distinguished group of architects and city planners as part of an effort to help Cuban professionals improve their skills.<br />
