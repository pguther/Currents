  <a name="dining" id="dining"></a>Changes in dining services
</p>
<p>
  <img align="right" height="127" src="../art/dininghall_logo.jpg" width="136" alt="" />This past March, the campus made a decision to operate its own dining services, enabling those services to become better aligned with the values of the university and with the expectations of its students. Toward that end, a transition team is developing a new business plan for the operation. Already, Colleges and University Housing Services has hired almost 200 dining services employees in positions that include UC benefits.<br />
</p>
<p>
  Other changes being made this fall include the expansion of dining hours. (<a href="http://www.slugfood.com/dining.html">Schedule</a>) Some of the dining halls have been consolidated: Meals are now being served from the Cowell/Stevenson Dining Hall at Cowell College, the Crown/Merrill Dining Hall at Crown College, the Colleges Nine/Ten Dining Hall, Porter College Dining Hall, the Oakes/College Eight Dining Hall at College Eight, and the UCSC Inn Dining Hall. The Stevenson and Merrill dining halls have been converted to activity centers for student programming.<br />
</p>
<p>
  Questions about the transition can be directed to Alma Sifuentes, director of residential and dining services, at (831) 420-3542.
