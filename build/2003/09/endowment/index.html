  Donor worked with Dean McHenry from 1967 to 1998
</p>
<p>
  Virginia "Ginger" Campbell, longtime executive assistant to UCSC founding chancellor Dean E. McHenry, has pledged a $10,000 gift to create an endowment in his honor at the University Library.
</p>
<p>
  The Campbell/McHenry Higher Education Endowment will be established in memory of Virginia's late husband, Don Campbell, and in honor of her professional partnership with Chancellor McHenry, whom she worked with from 1967 to 1998.<br />
</p>
<p>
  McHenry was appointed chancellor of UCSC in 1961, more than four years before the campus opened its doors to the first class of 650 students. He served for 13 years before retiring in 1974, but remained an active member of the UCSC community until his death in 1998.
</p>
<p>
  His vision, integrity, and deep commitment to higher education played an essential role in the successful development of the campus.<br />
</p>
<p>
  Campbell assisted McHenry throughout his retirement as he worked to help UCSC expand, but at the same time retain its distinctive values. McHenry believed that as the campus grew, students could enjoy the benefits of a major research university, but at the same time, avoid the impersonal environment of a large institution.<br />
</p>
<p>
  Campbell's gift is intended to enrich the UCSC library's collections in the field of higher education, providing materials on both its theory and practice. Income from the endowment will be used to purchase books, periodicals, reference works, archival and special collections resources, and electronic and nonprint media.<br />
</p>
<p>
  "Dean McHenry was such a mentor to me," Campbell noted. "I want to embellish the state-funded higher education collection in his honor to go far beyond what the library could normally acquire."<br />
