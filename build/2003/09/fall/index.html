  Some 6,000 students begin to move into university housing a week earlier
</p>
<p>
  The first day of classes in the 2003-04 school year at UCSC is Thursday, September 25. In anticipation of the new year, students began moving into university housing on Thursday, September 18, and were scheduled to do so through Sunday, September 21.<br />
</p>
<p>
  Here are some facts and figures about this year's student body and new academic programs the campus is offering:<br />
  <br />
  <br />
  <b>New Academic Programs for UCSC Students:</b>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>The Departments of Latin American and Latino Studies and Sociology are offering a new combined major.<br />
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>The Department of Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology and the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology are jointly offering a new bachelor's degree in health sciences.
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>In Language Studies, concentrations in modern Hebrew and Russian have been added.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>The Department of History is offering a new master's program.
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>A new interdisciplinary master's program in digital arts/new media is being offered.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <br />
  <b>Enrollment:</b><br />
</p>
<p>
  UCSC is expecting a 2003-04 enrollment of approximately 14,500 students.<br />
</p>
<p>
  Of the 14,500 students, approximately 13,100 are expected to be undergraduates; 1,400 are projected to enroll in graduate studies over the course of the year.<br />
  <br />
  Of the 13,100 undergraduates expected to enroll in the academic year, approximately 4,500 will be new students (3,500 freshmen and 1,000 transfer students).<br />
  <br />
  These 4,500 new undergraduates were admitted from among nearly 27,000 applicants, a record number for UCSC.<br />
  <br />
  <b>Profile of new freshmen:</b><br />
  <br />
  Of the total number of freshmen expected, approximately 850 identified themselves as either African American, American Indian, Asian/Asian American, Chicano, or Latino; of the freshmen enrolled last fall, a total of 755 were from those ethnic groups.<br />
  <br />
  The most popular majors among freshmen who have already declared are in the areas of the biological sciences and psychology, with approximately 300 students each. The Jack Baskin School of Engineering attracted approximately 200 freshmen in its majors.<br />
  <br />
  Approximately 40 percent of the freshmen have not declared a major. In an effort to better focus these students' selection of lower-division courses, UCSC has given them the option of selecting a "cluster" subject area of interest. Nearly 1,300 undeclared students are participating in this advising program to date, having selected one of the following clusters: business and economics; education; environmental sciences; human psychology, culture, and society; information sciences, engineering, and technology; languages, literatures, and communication; liberal arts and area studies; life and health sciences; physical sciences and math; and visual and performing arts and media.<br />
  <br />
  <b>Housing UCSC students:</b><br />
  <br />
  The capacity of UCSC's university-sponsored housing this fall is projected to total 6,143. As part of a two-day tour of all 10 colleges and the Village, Chancellor Greenwood and a group of other senior administrators were on hand to greet arriving students and their families.
