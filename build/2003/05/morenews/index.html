</p>
<p>
  Children at the Granary Child Development Center have a new climbing structure, child-size garden, tented grassy play area, and a tunnel in their sandbox. To celebrate the new playground and thank the many people who made it possible, Granary families and staff and community volunteers gathered for a party and ribbon-cutting ceremony on May 23. (<a href="granary.html">More photos</a> )
</p>
<p>
  A broad array of campus and community members were involved in renovating the playground at the center, including members of the Kiwanis Club and its college affiliate, the Circle K Club; UCSC undergraduate Mark Ng, who launched the Empty Ink Cartridge Recycling Project to raise funds for new playground equipment; the UCSC Farm &amp; Garden, which donated plants; parents in UCSC's Family Student Housing who helped plant grass; First Five, Santa Cruz County's Children and Families Commission, which provided a grant to help fund the renovation; KaBoom, a Redwood City-based nonprofit organization that provides grants for community-supported playground renovations; and the California Department of Education, which also contributed financial support.<br />
