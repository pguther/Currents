</p>
<p>
  The Dickens Project is sponsoring a five-week seminar for college instructors, funded by the National Endowment for the Humanities. Fifteen scholars from around the country will be selected to participate and will need housing from approximately June 25 through July 30. Because of the length of time and the attractiveness of Santa Cruz as a vacation destination, some participants may choose to bring their partners or families for all or part of the time. If you are able to offer accommodations during this period, call (831) 459-2103 or send e-mail to <a href="mailto:dpj@ucsc.edu">dpj@ucsc.edu</a>.<br />
