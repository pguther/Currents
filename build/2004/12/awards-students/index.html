<p>
  Two UCSC students and an alumnus whose quick action led to the apprehension of a suspect in a recent attack at the campus library were honored Friday by campus police.
</p>
<p>
  Julia Dean, a community studies senior from Atlanta; Jeff Basinger, a film and digital media junior from Poway; and Kai Chang, a 1999 psychology graduate who works at Industrial Light and Magic in San Rafael, were given awards for "outstanding citizenship" at a breakfast at University House.
</p>
<p>
  The three, who were on the scene when a woman was knocked to the ground inside the library, provided police with information about the alleged assailant and the vehicle in which he fled.
</p>
<p>
  UCSC Police Chief Mickey Aluffi noted that Dean was struck by the alleged assailant when she tried to stop him, and that both Basinger and Chang were threatened with a knife. "It was an act of courage and bravery, and we thank each of you," Aluffi said in presenting each with a certificate and pin.
</p>
<p>
  Julia Dean was working on a computer in the library near where the other student was attacked, and shouted to others in the library to "call 911" as she grabbed the alleged assailant by the collar, she recalled.
</p>
<p>
  Her shout alerted others, and Basinger and Chang followed the alleged assailant, despite being threatened with a knife. They helped each other remember the suspect's license number, and called campus police. Days after UCSC police put out an all-points-bulletin in September, the suspect was arrested in Oregon.
</p>
<p>
  Also at the breakfast, Nancy Carroll was sworn in as captain/assistant police chief. Carroll worked for the department from 1981 to 2003, holding several positions, including investigator, patrol sergeant, canine officer, and field-training manager. She returned to the department in early 2004, serving as interim captain since February.<br />
