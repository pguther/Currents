  <a name="scanners" id="scanners"></a>Scanners designed to ease campus inventory<br />
</p>
<p>
  Paper and pencil are on their way out for the annual campus inventory. Beginning in March, hand-held laser scanners that look and function similar to a Palm Pilot will be used instead.<br />
</p>
<p>
  "It's going to be a quicker and more efficient way for the campus to collect and update its data," said Julie Ola, UCSC's equipment manager, noting that the new system will be made available in March. "It takes a fraction of the time."<br />
  Bar-coded property number labels were placed on all campus equipment earlier to prepare for the switch.<br />
</p>
<p>
  "There will be less margin for error," Ola said of the scanners, explaining that the scanner requires users to fill in all categories, so nothing is overlooked.<br />
  <br />
  "It's a simple program to follow. Anyone who's ever used a computer will be comfortable using this," said Ola, who worked with Nutan Kopel, the equipment management assistant, to develop and implement the change. By hiring a programmer to adapt an existing scanning program, rather than create one from scratch, the new system came in at about half its projected budget, Ola said.<br />
</p>
<p>
  Inventory will be conducted as usual from March 1 to June 1. Those wanting to sign out a scanner should call equipment management at (831) 459-2355.<br />
