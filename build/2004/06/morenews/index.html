  <img align="right" height="135" src="Http://currents.ucsc.edu/03-04/art/dining_logo.04-06-28.small.jpg" width="140" alt="" />Campus dining halls were packed with a different clientele than usual on June 16 as faculty and staff members took advantage of a free lunch, courtesy of University Dining Services.
</p>

  The special offer was part of a "soft opening" for the transition to a university-run dining hall system. (See <a href="http://currents.ucsc.edu/03-04/06-14/dining.html">earlier <i>Currents</i> story</a>.)<br />
  <br />
  "Thanks to the dedicated and creative effort of many individuals, UC Santa Cruz has a University-operated dining service, as of June 20," Acting Chancellor Martin M. Chemers said in a <a href="http://messages.ucsc.edu/03-04/06-28.dining.html">message to the campus community.</a><br />

  <a name="name" id="name"></a>Name change for UCSC Inn and Conference Center
</p>
<p>
  The UCSC Inn and Conference Center will be knows as the University Inn and Conference Center beginning July 1. A new sign in front of the hotel will reflect the change.<br />
</p>
<p>
  "The change of name comes from input our guests have given us over the course of the last couple of years. It is unclear from the name that hotel rooms are available to the general public," said Alma Sifuentes, director of Residential and Dining Services. "The change in name is a slight one," she said, "but we feel that it will make a significant difference in welcoming guests not affiliated with the university, particularly during summer months."<br />
