  <a name="savings" id="savings"></a>UC Regents approve new tax-advantaged retirement savings plan for faculty and staff
</p>
<p>
  At their May 19-20 meeting, the UC Regents approved a new voluntary savings plan that effectively doubles the amount of money UC faculty and staff may put into tax-advantaged retirement savings. In addition to the Tax-Deferred 403(b) Plan UC currently offers, this new plan will give employees even greater opportunities to save for retirement and enjoy the valuable benefits of tax-deferred savings.
</p>
<p>
  The new plan, defined as a 457(b) plan by the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), currently has the same contribution limits as the 403(b) Plan; however, the contribution limits set by the IRC for each plan do not offset one another. For example, an employee who already contributes the maximum amount permitted to UC's 403(b) Plan ($13,000 in 2004) could also put up to $13,000 annually in tax-deferred savings in the new 457(b) plan. Employees will have the choice to enroll in either or both plans. See full text of <a href="http://atyourservice.ucop.edu/news/general/retirement_savings.html">press release.</a><br />
