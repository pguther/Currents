<p>
  Community studies major Evelyn Richards discovered the powerful medium of film while making her first-ever documentary about local solidarity efforts for striking grocery workers in southern California.<br />
</p>
<p>
  "It's incredible," said Richards, who collaborated with community studies major Jamie Radenbaugh to make <i>Starting with Health Care: Building Solidarity in the Safeway Struggle.</i>
</p>
<p>
  After viewing several student projects produced during last quarter's class, <i>Video Production of the Social Documentary,</i> including documentaries about a local dog park and the campaign to change UCSC food-service providers, Richards said, "I feel really close to all those issues now."<br />
</p>
<p>
  Richards is one of several UCSC students whose films will premiere during "Reel Work," <a href="http://www.reelwork.org/">http://www.reelwork.org/</a> the third annual May Day Labor Film Festival, which takes place April 25-May 1, with screenings on campus and at several community venues.<br />
</p>
<p>
  Begun in 2002 to increase awareness of the labor movement, the festival presents a mix of rare and well-known critically acclaimed films. In addition to presenting student films, highlights of the festival include:<br />
</p>
<p>
  * Two appearances by Marta Rodriguez and screenings of her film, <i>Love, Women, and Flowers,</i> a powerful documentary that captures the struggles of women who work on farms in Colombia where flowers are grown for export.<br />
</p>
<p>
  * Members of the San Francisco Mime Troupe will attend the screening of their forthcoming film, <i>Mr. Smith Goes to Obscuristan,</i> and will discuss the production of the documentary.<br />
</p>
<p>
  * UCSC labor historian Dana Frank will offer comments following a screening of <i>Modern Times,</i> Charlie Chaplin's 1936 masterpiece about the dawning of the machine age.<br />
</p>
<p>
  * The screening of <i>Miami 2003: Your Tax Dollars at Work,</i> a film by Lisa Mastramico, assistant field-study coordinator for community studies, that captures the tension between free trade and free speech.<br />
</p>
<p>
  * Film festival coorganizer Paul Ortiz, assistant professor of community studies, will discuss <i>Germinal,</i> a 1993 French classic about the struggles of coal miners.<br />
</p>
<p>
  In addition, Haskell Wexler, director of photography for <i>Matewan</i> and <i>One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,</i> will attend the screening of his film <i>Bus Riders Union.</i> Wexler will also discuss his collaboration with Ian Ruskin on their film, <i>The Harry Bridges Project,</i> which captures Ruskin's one-man Chautauqua performance about the life of the renowned labor leader. Ruskin will also give a live performance of the play <i>From Wharf Rats to Lords of the Docks.</i><br />
</p>
<p>
  The festival concludes Saturday, May 1, with a gala celebration at the Rio Theater in Santa Cruz, where filmmakers, producers, labor historians, and union organizers featured in the films will discuss their work.<br />
</p>
<p>
