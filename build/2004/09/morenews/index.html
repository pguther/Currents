  <a name="olympics" id="olympics"></a>UC athletes perform well at Athens Olympics
</p>
<p>
  The University of California sent 110 athletes-- winning 36 medals including 13 gold -- to the recently concluded 2004 Olympic Games in Athens, Greece, a larger contingent than was sent by many countries. Historically, participants with UC connections have performed well in these international competitions and the Summer Games proved to be no exception. In fact, if UC were a country, its 2004 medal total would have been exceeded by only six other nations (U.S., Russia, China, Australia, Germany, and Japan).
</p>
<p>
  UC students and alumni won a total of 13 gold, 10 silver and 13 bronze medals.<br />
  <br />
  Among Olympic athletes winning multiple medals were swimmers and UC alums Natalie Coughlin, 22, [UC Berkeley], who led the UC participants with five medals including two gold and two silver, and Jason Lezak, 28, [UC Santa Barbara], who won two gold medals and a bronze.
