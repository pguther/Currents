Presented as part of a program titled "Korean Music Today," the piece was also performed at the Intercultural Creativity Festival/Conference in Sydney. A paper, titled "A Contemporary Globalisation of Korean Arts and Religion: Hi Kyung Kim's Rituels," was also presented at both events by musicologist Jinmi Davidson of the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.

  <i>Rituel III</i> is a collaborative work featuring composer Kim; multimedia artist and UCSC assistant art professor Elliot Anderson; clarinetist and music lecturer John Sackett; percussion lecturer William Winant; San Francisco Conservatory cellist Jean-Michel Fonteneau; stage director and music lecturer Brian Staufenbiel; lighting artist Sylvie Vray; and Ensemble Parallele, conducted by music professor Nicole Paiement; plus music performed by the Korean ensemble: Jeong Seung Kim on daegeum, Chan Hae Lee on jing, and dancer/choreographer Aeju Lee, the Korean National Intangible Treasure in Buddhist Dance.<br />
</p>
