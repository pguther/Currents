  By Flora Ling, UCSC Arboretum
</p>
<p>
  Gardening is a contemplative, thought-provoking experience. No gardener who sees the seasons change--the gentle passage from seed to plant, flower, and fruit, and finally to decline--can help but wonder at the process.
</p>
<p>
  Each task, from planting to pruning, fertilizing to composting, brings to mind questions about how to tackle the situation. Some may even question why they garden at all.
</p>
<p>
  Beginning this month, a series of provocative lectures at the UCSC Arboretum will please the thinking gardener.
</p>
<p>
  Leading experts and professionals who have thought, written, and attempted to answer these questions will discuss such topics as gardening heroines, aesthetics, history, and design. Thoughtful gardeners will find that others have walked the paths to solutions in the garden.
</p>
<p>
  The first in the series of benefit lectures features Betsy Fryberger, curator of prints and drawings at Stanford University's Cantor Art Center. She will talk about "Three Heroines of the Garden: Gertrude Jekyll, Beatrix Farrand, and Vita Sackville-West." These three grand ladies of the garden world shaped our artistic sensibilities through their creations. About a century ago, each contributed ideas and gardens of lasting substance that inform our current idea of what constitutes a fine garden. She will highlight their accomplishments with slides of Jekyll's restored garden at Upton Grey, of Farrand's Dumbarton Oaks, and of Sackville-West's Sissinghurst. She will also discuss their differing literary endeavors and fascinating personal lives.
</p>
<p>
  Other lecturers in the series will offer knowledge ranging from the practical, as in principles of design, to the horticultural, as in details of the beloved geranium family or native monkey flowers, to the historical, as in memorable California gardens. There will be something to provoke the most avid gardener as he or she contemplates weeding that stubborn patch in the corner. Hearing a paleobotanist talk about the fossil record, you may find yourself thinking about long-gone forests that stood where your garden now lives.
</p>
<p>
  The lecture schedule runs until June 2005. All lectures are Sunday at 1:30 p.m. in the Horticulture II Building at the Arboretum. Tickets are $15 for the general public, $10 for Arboretum members and guests. For more information, call (831) 427-2998 or visit the <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/arboretum">Arboretum web site</a>.
