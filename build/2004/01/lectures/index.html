<p>
  Internationally renowned AIDS researcher Robert Gallo, award-winning social psychologist Elliot Aronson, and UC Berkeley astronomy professor and planet hunter Geoffrey Marcy are just a few of the diverse array of speakers set to appear at UCSC in the coming year.
</p>
<p>
  It's all part of UCSC's 2004 "Thinking at the Edge" Distinguished Lecture Series, which kicks off on January 20 with a presentation by actress and producer Yolanda King, the daughter of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. All of the lectures are free and open to the public.<br />
</p>
<p>
  Since the founding of the campus in 1965, UCSC's academic divisions and departments have presented hundreds of special lecture events that have been primarily attended by members of the campus community. The 2004 "Thinking at the Edge" series is designed to highlight and feature those lectures that would be of the greatest interest to the general public.<br />
</p>
<p>
  "The campus is eager to bring these engaging, thought-provoking lectures--addressing a wide range of scientific, social, and political issues--to the broader community," noted Ronald P. Suduiko, vice chancellor for University Relations.<br />
</p>
<p>
  "There are many great lectures offered on campus throughout the year that the community would love, but doesn't always hear about," added University Events director Trink Praxel. "This new lecture series will give some of these lectures greater visibility and give the community new opportunities to share in the campus's academic offerings."<br />
