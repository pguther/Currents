  <font color="#003399">Organic produce at the Farm market cart Tuesdays and Fridays</font>
</h4>
<font color="#000000">The campus's popular market cart is overflowing with fresh organic produce and lovely flower bouquets each Tuesday and Friday afternoon from noon until 6 p.m. The cart is located in front of the Barn Theater at the intersection of Bay and High Streets. The early-season selection includes beets, carrots, leeks, potatoes, lettuces, spinach, and chard. And the array of fruits and vegetables gets even better as the growing season progresses. Regular patrons know that summer brings sweet corn, dry-farmed tomatoes, a colorful show of sweet and hot peppers, and more.<br />
<br />
The cart is open through the summer and into the fall. All proceeds benefit the UCSC Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems' apprenticeship program in ecological horticulture. For more information, call (831) 459-3248.</font>
<h4>
  <font color="#003399">Gear up for summer</font>

<p>
  The <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/opers/rec/rentals.html">Outdoor Equipment Rental Center</a> at the Office of Physical Education, Recreation, and Sports (OPERS) can help you gear up for any trip or outdoor adventure this summer. The center is open to all students, staff, and faculty; it rents camping and mountaineering gear, water-sports equipment, and bicycle gear at extremely reasonable prices.

<h4>
  <font color="#003399">Staff and faculty mentors sought</font>
</h4>
<p>
  The Paige and Eloise Smith Scholastic Society is bringing together UCSC alumni, faculty, and staff to serve the educational aspirations of UCSC students who are foster children, wards of the court, and orphans. There will be over 40 of these students on campus next fall. They will receive scholarships from the Paige and Eloise Smith Scholastic Society, but they will also need other help.<br />
  <br />
  Can you help someone through the registration process? Could you correspond occasionally via e-mail with a student needing advice about a major? Perhaps you could help a new student connect with just the right faculty member to explore their visions or goals. If you are interested in any level of mentorship relationship with a current student who has been a foster child, ward of the court, or orphan, please contact Lynn Zachreson in the Alumni Office at ( 831) 459-5842.
