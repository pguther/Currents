  <h4>
  <font color="#003399">David Anthony</font>
</h4>
<p>
  <font color="#000000">David H. Anthony, associate professor of history and provost of Oakes College, was one of the contributors to the study guide for the documentary film,</font> <a href="http://www.irisfilms.org/longnight/"><i>Long Night's Journey Into Day: South Africa's Search for Truth and Reconciliation,</i></a> <font color="#000000">produced by Frances Reid and Deborah Hoffmann for Iris Films. The film won the Grand Jury Prize for Best Documentary at the Sundance Film Festival 2000. It presents four cases from the Truth and Reconciliation Commission hearings that illustrate the range of political violence with which the TRC struggled to deal. These were the cases of Amy Biehl, an American antiapartheid activist killed by a South African youth; the Cradock 4, organizers assassinated by police; Robert McBride, an African National Congress activist charged with triple bombings of civilian targets; and the Guguletu 7, seven young men killed in a police set-up. For the study guide, Anthony prepared a comparative history of South Africa and the United States. This powerful film is an extremely important social document. A video edition of the film is currently available through</font> <a href="http://www.newsreel.org/films/longnight.htm">California Newsreel.</a>
</p>
<h4>
  <font color="#003399">Edward Houghton</font>
</h4>
<p>
  Edward Houghton, professor of music and dean of the Arts Division, presented a lecture on the music of Johannes Ockeghem in October at the National Institute for Music Research in Berlin. The lecture preceded the first performance of his critical edition of Ockeghem's <i>Missa Au travail suis,</i> sung by the Tallis Scholars at the opening concerts of the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester at Philharmonic Hall. Ockeghem's 15th-century masterpiece was juxtaposed with Gustav Mahler's monumental Ninth Symphony. "Ockeghem und Mahler: Geht das?" asked the critic of <i>Der Tagespiegel</i> and also answered, "Es geht wunderbar."<br />
  <br />
  An essay by Houghton, titled "A close reading of Compere's motet <i>Sile fragor,</i>" appears in the recent book <i>Essays on Music and Culture in Honor of Herbert Kellman</i>, published in the series <i>Epitome musical</i> by the Centre d'Etudes Superieures de la Renaissance (Tours, France).

<h4>
  <font color="#003399">Jennifer Mills</font>
</h4>
<p>
  Jennifer Mills, a student in the master's program in teaching, has received a $20,000 Governor's Teaching Fellowship. Mills, who received her B.A. in history from UCSC in 1999, was one of 250 students to be awarded the competitive prize. This is the first year the awards have been given to students preparing to teach in low-performing schools in California. In addition to her studies, Mills works for the Government Publications Unit of the University Library and for its monthly newsletter, <i>Broadside</i>.
</p>
<h4>
  <font color="#003399">David Swanger</font>
</h4>
<p>
  David Swanger, professor of education and creative writing, was invited to speak at Stanford University in an interdisciplinary seminar titled, "The Work of Art and the Creation of Mind," at a session based on an article of Swanger's, "The Metaphysics of Poetry," which appeared in the <i>Journal of Aesthetic Education</i> (Fall 1997). Swanger was also invited to deliver a plenary address, "Missing or Misunderstood: Children in Western Educational Philosophy," at the University of San Francisco for the 49th Annual Meeting of the Far Western Philosophy of Education Society.<br />
  <br />
  Swanger's poem, "What the Wing Says," has been selected for inclusion of the second edition of <i>Spreading the Word: Editors on Poetry,</i> a collection of essays by editors of literary magazines on poems they consider particularly memorable.
</p>
<p>
  In addition, Swanger has been elected to a second term as chair of the Santa Cruz City Arts Commission.<br />
