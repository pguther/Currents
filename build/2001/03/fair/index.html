<p>
  Current and prospective students, their families, and alumni are invited to campus on Saturday, April 21, for UCSC's annual Banana Slug Spring Fair.
</p>
<p>An array of special events, including reunions for alumni and academic information fairs for prospective students, a student block party, dance performance, tours, and a nature walk, are on the schedule.</p>
<p>
  Prospective students and their families will find a wealth of opportunities to learn about the campus.
</p>
<p>
  Prospective students interested in natural sciences or engineering can take advantage of academic advising from 9 a.m. to noon. An advising session for those interested in the arts, humanities, or social sciences will take place from 12:30 to 4 p.m. Workshops explaining UCSC's college system and financial aid, and a range of panel discussions, will also be offered.
</p>
<p>
  College tours get under way at 10 a.m. and continue until 3 p.m.; there is also a 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. open house at the Women's Center.
</p>
<p>
  Several special events are planned to give visitors a taste of student life. At College Nine, the audience will be invited to participate as the Taiko Drummers perform at 2 p.m. Visitors are also welcome as College Nine students paint the first murals on the walls of UCSC's newest college (11 a.m. to 3 p.m.), reflecting their vision of the college's international theme. Student organizations, meanwhile, will be hosting a block party at the Hahn Student Services Bldg. from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.
</p>
<p>
  Porter College Arts Day will present <i>Chautauqua</i> from 1 to 3 p.m., a festival of new and experimental work by students. The festival will include performance of scenes from student-written and -directed plays, and art exhibitions at Porter College's Hall and Bridge Galleries displaying the work of Porter students. Students will perform music including taiko, marimba, ensemble, and opera. The region's plant life will be on display during a Garden Tour at 1 p.m. (meet at the Merrill College information table), with opportunities to take something home at the Arboretum plant sale in conjunction with the California Native Plant Society sale (11 a.m. to 3 p.m.).
</p>
<p>
  Redwood forests, open fields, and live-oak groves will be the attraction during the College Nine Nature Walk, a gentle afternoon hike starting at the College Nine shuttle stop at 3 p.m.
</p>
<p>
  Visitors won't have to leave campus to find a bite to eat; a barbecue lunch will be on sale at various campus locations.
</p>
<p>
  After exploring, visitors can take in "Santa Cruz Dance," featuring the works of choreographers Tandy Beal, Mel Wong, and Scott Wells, at 8 p.m., April 20-21, at UCSC Theater Arts Mainstage. A different repertoire will be featured each night. Call the Ticket Office at (831) 459-2159.

<p>
  Reunions and other events will focus on those returning to their alma mater.<br />
  All alumni will have a chance to reconnect with friends from the past at the Alumni Association's All-Alumni Reunion Luncheon, from 11:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. at Porter College Dining Hall. Tables will be grouped by year to help people find old friends. In addition, two colleges--Kresge and Stevenson--will also hold reunions.

</p>
<p>
  Kresge College will celebrate its 30th anniversary throughout the weekend, beginning with an informal Saturday brunch from 10 to 11:30 a.m. In the afternoon there will be two panel discussions, "Kresge: Vision and Revision."
</p>
<p>
  One panel will feature founding faculty; the other will feature more recent faculty and students. Kresge will hold a college dinner Saturday night, including a video collection of college photographs and memories, memory books, and entertainment.

  Stevenson College will celebrate its 35th anniversary with a day of festivities. Events include presentation of a core course lecture by founding professor of politics Peter Euben. A reception will follow, hosted by Stevenson College provost Tyler Stovall in the Stevenson College Library.
