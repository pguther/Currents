</p>
<p>
  Like a winning football coach, UCSC assistant fire chief Mike Eno wants his team to be ready for the big game. For firefighters, the equivalent of the big game is a major emergency that challenges the resources of the campus Fire and Police Departments.
</p>
<p>UCSC fire and police personnel will host a countywide mutual-aid emergency training drill on Friday, August 24. The drill is part of a monthly training program in which regional police and fire agencies regularly participate, and it is UCSC’s turn to host the event, said Eno.<br />
<br />
“In a major emergency situation, we rely on help from outside police, fire departments, and ambulances, so we have to practice with these people,” said Eno, who joined the campus in June.<br />
<br />
This month’s drill will involve more than 50 police officers, firefighters, highway patrol officers, sheriff’s deputies, and emergency medical personnel from UCSC and surrounding cities. The exercise will feature an “active shooter” scenario in which an armed individual is holding hostages and many people have been injured, explained Eno.<br />
<br />
“Unfortunately, these situations are nothing new on America’s school campuses, and fire, police and emergency medical personnel must be prepared,” said Eno.<br />
<br />
The drill will take place from 9 a.m. until about noon in the Community Room of the Crown-Merrill Apartments, said Eno. The goal is to make the exercise “as realistic as possible” without disrupting business for the rest of campus.<br />
<br />
“The idea is to stage a multiple-casualty incident–or MCI–that would overwhelm the four firefighters we have on duty on any given day,” said Eno.<br />
<br />
Staffing levels require multiple agencies to work together to respond to large-scale emergencies, and drills such as this one offer invaluable opportunities to refine coordination. “The cops and fire personnel have got to play together,” said Eno. During the attack at Columbine High School in Colorado, police and fire agencies had separate command posts at the school. “We’re not going to do that,” said Eno.<br />
<br />
In the scenario that has been developed for the exercise, a Santa Cruz police officer will play the “bad guy,” an angry 19-year-old male student who has failed an exam. Armed with a semiautomatic 9mm handgun, the “student” has opened fire on a roomful of unarmed students, many of whom are badly wounded by the time emergency officials receive a call from a student who escaped and ran to a pay phone to call 911.<br />
<br />
Crown-Merrill maintenance staff will play the role of the hostages, said Eno, adding that many participants will use makeup to look bloody and injured.<br />
<br />
Through traffic will not be allowed on Chinquapin Road during the training, and a Stevenson College parking lot will be used as a staging area for fire trucks and ambulances during the exercise, noted Eno.<br />
<br />
“Chinquapin will be closed off, but nobody is going to be going through the campus with lights and sirens blaring,” he said. “It will be nice and low key.” An air ambulance will land on campus, but the entire operation will not disrupt campus business, assured Eno.<br />
<br />
“After all, we had air ambulances land on campus twice last week for real medical emergencies,” said Eno.<br />
<br />
After the exercise, participants will gather for a lunch debriefing and critique in the College Eight Dining Hall.<br />
<br />
In the event of any real emergencies during the exercise, one engine company will be standing by throughout the drill to respond to calls, added Eno.</p>
