  <h1>UCSC receives $13.5 million in private support</h1>

  UC Santa Cruz received $13.5 million in private support in the 2000-2001 fiscal year, which includes $2.28 million from the David and Lucile Packard Foundation for coastal ocean research. "This grant recognizes the crucial role of UCSC's scientific community in increasing our understanding of the ocean environments most heavily influenced by human activity," said Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood. "Coming on top of an earlier five-year commitment by the Packard Foundation, this is a vote of confidence in UCSC's outstanding field research." UCSC's portion of the original grant was $3.2 million. The grant funds the Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans (PISCO) and involves researchers at UCSC, UC Santa Barbara, Oregon State University, and Stanford University. The new funding enables UCSC researchers to expand their activities in several critical areas, including molecular genetics, near-shore oceanography, and selective tagging of marine species.<i><br />
  <br /></i>UCSC's New Teacher Center, a national resource dedicated to teacher development and new teacher training, also received considerable support, drawing grants from three different foundations. The Walter S. Johnson Foundation gave $750,000 to the center's efforts to assist school districts, with an emphasis on the East Bay area. The Stupski Family Foundation gave $730,293 to fund creation and dissemination of a coaching-based professional development model for administrators. The Noyce Foundation gave $500,000 for the center's Silicon Valley initiative for teacher support. In addition to the larger grants, UCSC receives gifts from many individual donors who provide significant support to the campus annually. Gifts to the Annual Fund, including the telephone outreach program, direct mail, and personal solicitations, totaled $1.20 million. Included in this total is $133,000 given to the Alumni Association Scholarship Fund. Trustees of the UC Santa Cruz Foundation, which supports UCSC through its private fundraising efforts, gave over $1 million to the campus this past year. Ronald P. Suduiko, UCSC's vice chancellor for University Relations, credited individuals, businesses, foundations, and others for providing valuable support to UCSC. "We are extremely grateful for the many individuals and organizations that have come forward to support the programs and people of UCSC. As a public institution, we rely upon philanthropy to enhance the support provided by the state and tuition. It is only through this generosity that we are able to provide such a high-quality learning environment for our students," he said.<i><br />
  <br /></i>The bulk of the contributions this past year came from the following sources: foundations, $7.19 million; individuals, $3.08 million; and the business sector, $1.93 million. Other sources, including community and campus organizations, gave a total of $1.29 million.
