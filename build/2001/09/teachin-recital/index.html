  Eager to share their expertise and talent during this time of national crisis, UCSC faculty have organized a Middle East teach-in for September 27 and a benefit recital September 30 at Holy Cross Church. Both events are free and open to the public. The teach-in, "The Crisis: The Middle East Dimension," will feature three faculty members participating in a facilitated discussion with KZSC station manager and local radio talk show host Eric Schoeck on Thursday, September 27, at 7:30 p.m. in Classroom Unit II. The participants are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Alan Richards, a professor of environmental studies and an expert on the political economy of the Middle East. Richards has been a frequent consultant to the State Department and the Department of Defense on Middle Eastern affairs during the past 10 years. He is coauthor of the book A Political Economy of the Middle East.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Paul Lubeck, a professor of sociology, specializes in the political economy of development and globalization with a focus on Islamic society and identities. His most recent project, funded by the Carnegie Corporation, examines the ways in which Islamic social movements are responding the forces of globalization.<br />
    <br />
  </li>
  <li>Edmund "Terry" Burke III, a professor of history and an expert on Islam and the Middle East. He is the editor of Struggle and Survival in the Modern Middle East and coeditor of Islam, Politics and Social Movements.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The event is the first of several planned public forums organized by an ad hoc faculty working group on current events, said Burke, who is chair of the group. "We hope to follow up with one-hour lectures in the weeks ahead," added Burke.<br />
  <br />
  Also coming up is a benefit recital on Sunday, September 30, at 3 p.m. at Holy Cross Church in Santa Cruz.<br />
  <br />
  Pianist Mary Jane Cope and flutist Leta Miller of UCSC's Music Department will be joined by violinist Michelle Witt, manager of UCSC Arts and Lectures, in a performance "intended to provide a healing experience for those in attendance," said Cope. Donations will be accepted for the American Red Cross disaster relief fund.
