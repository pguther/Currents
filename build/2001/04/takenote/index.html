</h4>
<p>
  The Wildlands and Watering Cans Summer Day Camp at the UCSC Farm offers hands-on gardening and wilderness activities for children ages 7 to 10. Each day will be filled with activities from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. A maximum of 24 campers will be enrolled for each weeklong session. Three sessions will be offered: June 25-29; July 9-13; and July 16-20. The curriculum will be repeated each week.
</p>
<p>
  The camp is designed to foster environmental awareness while encouraging children to cooperate and have fun outside. Campers will create their own garden beds, explore insects and herbs, and make garden-based crafts. Campers will be exposed to organic farming practices such as composting and soil care, and they will help apprentices in the UCSC ecological horticulture program harvest vegetables for the weekly market. In addition, campers will enjoy local wilderness excursions that include tours of the UCSC Arboretum, the Pogonip Open Space Preserve, and Wilder Ranch.
</p>

  Fees are $135/week for members of the Friends of the UCSC Farm and Garden and $150 for nonmembers. Call (831) 459-3240 for registration information.
