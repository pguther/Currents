<p>
  When Bay Tree Bookstore moves across the plaza in late spring or early summer, it will set in motion a number of changes designed to make the plaza a campus hub.
</p>
<p>The new bookstore will be three times the size of the present facility and will include a mini-mart, computer repair service, book buyback windows, and student ID card service.</p>
<p>
  Moving into the vacated bookstore will be the student center, to be renamed the Student Union. Since substantial renovation will be needed, at first the union will offer limited service. "It will be like a satellite student union, not a full-service student union," said Tara Crowley, director of student centers.
</p>
<p>
  Once renovations are complete, possibly around spring 2002, the union is expected to include a mini movie theater, event/entertainment space, the bike co-op, student lounges, and meeting rooms. Student Development and Community Service staff members are in line to move in this summer or fall, with student organizations moving in later. (The Educational Opportunity Programs Learning Center will relocate to the current Student Center site.)<br />
  <br />
  The current Student Center's out-of-the-way location has not been conducive to student interaction, and the fact that the Bookstore-Upper Quarry area is already a campus crossroads was a crucial factor in the move. "Location, location, location," said John Holloway, executive director of Student Development and Community Service. "That's the reason we're there."<br />
  <br />
  Looking further ahead, thinking has begun on designing a larger student union at the plaza. Those efforts are in the very early stages, said Holloway. "A brand-new facility could easily be a 10-year project."<br />
  <br />
  Input on the plaza's future was received from students, faculty, and staff gathered at the annual "town hall meeting" at Cowell College Dining Room on April 17.<br />
  <br />
  Speaking to the participants, Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood and Francisco Hernandez, vice chancellor of student affairs, cited a need for more on-campus entertainment and gathering places, and Holloway showed architectural drawings of what a new student union building might look like.<br />
  <br />
  The Tuesday meeting followed considerable research by the Student Center Governance Board, including visits to unions as far away as New York. From these visits, the staff had some general ideas of services and facilities that might work at UCSC, including a ballroom, banking services, a nightclub, travel services, and a sports bar.<br />
  <br />
  Several of these ideas drew support from participants on April 17, who also came up with ideas of their own. Participants were divided into task forces looking at different aspects of the plaza, such as the quarry, student union service, and nightlife.<br />
  <br />
  One recurrent suggestion was that places serving students--from computer labs to restaurants--should be open later. "Nothing is open late night, and we are annoyed," said A. J. Knufken, a third-year Oakes student representing a task force on student union services.<br />
  <br />
  Other suggestions for the plaza included:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>A Times Square-style news ticker, possibly paid for by a sponsor, announcing coming events.
  </li>
  <li>Sports and academic competitions among colleges to add both a sense of competition and community.
  </li>
  <li>Outreach-retention services.
  </li>
  <li>Multipurpose rooms to accommodate a variety of events, from dances to billiards and piano playing.
  </li>
  <li>An interfaith center, possibly built with contributions from religious organizations.
  </li>
  <li>Added restrooms and possibly a retractable stage roof at the Upper Quarry.
  </li>
  <li>Special events, such as art festivals, farmers' markets, music, and dances with DJs, as well as open microphones.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <br />
  While some of these suggestions will be helpful in setting up the first student union, the Student Center Governance Board, Student Development and Community Service, and the Student Affairs Division will also be assessing student needs and interests to determine the size of the permanent student union building.<br />
  <br />
  "Students seem to be really excited about the possibilities," said Holloway. He noted that many students have been to student unions at other campuses, adding, "We want to be able to offer our students similar experiences, but do it in a way that's unique to Santa Cruz."
