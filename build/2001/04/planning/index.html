  <h1>Long-range budget-planning initiative enters second phase</h1>

  
  <p class="date">Louise Donahue</p>
  

  <p>
  UCSC's long-range budget planning initiative, launched by Campus Provost John Simpson this past winter, has moved into its second phase.<br />
  <br />
  Each academic and administrative division has completed the first step of the project, drafting and submitting an executive summary of its preliminary 10-year plan. Now, in a phase of the initiative process that will continue through June, each of those plans will be reviewed by academic and administrative committees.<br />
  <br />
  George Brown, vice provost for academic affairs, said that--because of the magnitude of the project--many in the campus community "at first were not entirely enthusiastic" about the idea of drawing up their part of the campus's 10-year plan. He said attitudes have changed, however, and many have found the long-term process far more valuable than year-to-year planning.<br />
  <br />
  "Academic departments and divisions can now envision their units at maturity and devise realistic strategies for achieving their long-range goals," Brown said.<br />
  <br />
  The deans of Engineering, Natural Sciences, Social Sciences, Humanities, and Arts presented their divisions' preliminary plans April 10 to a joint meeting of the Provost's Advisory Council, the Academic Planning Committee, and the Academic Support Planning Committee. The committees will hold a second joint meeting, on April 24, to hear the executive summaries from Business and Administrative Services, Student Affairs, the Library, the Office of Research, University Relations, and the Provost's Office.<br />
  <br />
  Brown said the first session provided a good opportunity for academic planners and academic support officers, as well as key Academic Senate representatives, to hear and comment on the proposals. Potential areas of collaboration across division lines were also apparent, he said. The role of UCSC in improving K-12 education, for instance, came up in more than one presentation. Many preliminary plans for cross-divisional graduate programs were also introduced, addressing such issues as the environment, health, and technology.<br />
  <br />
  The next step in the process will come when the Academic Senate's Committee on Planning and Budget and the administrative committees draw up their own reports and forward these documents to Simpson. These comments, along with specific feedback from the campus provost, will provide divisions with a preliminary campus assessment of their plans, said Beau Willis, assistant campus provost.<br />
  <br />
  Division administrators are to provide detailed plans to Simpson by December 3. The campus's comprehensive plan, incorporating these submissions, is scheduled to be completed by April or May of 2002.<br />
