  The American Helicopter Society (AHS) International has awarded the 2006 Robert L. Lichten Award to Jacob Wilson, a programmer/analyst with the University Affiliated Research Center (UARC). This honor is awarded each year for the best paper submitted to the AHS by a first-time author of a nationally distributed technical publication.
</p>
<p>
  Wilson provides engineering support for research on rotorcraft (i.e., helicopters) at NASA Ames Research Center. He works on a UARC project called the Rotor Comprehensive Analysis System (RCAS), a large, multidisciplinary computer software system designed to analyze the performance, stability and control, aeroelastic stability, loads and vibration, aerodynamics, and acoustics characteristics of rotorcraft. RCAS was developed to improve rotorcraft analysis capability and to support rotorcraft research and development activities throughout the rotorcraft technical community.

  As part of his award, Wilson will be attending the annual AHS Forum in Phoenix, May 9 to 11, where he will present his paper and receive special recognition. The award includes travel to the Forum, complimentary registration and lodging, a $500 honorarium, and a $500 stipend.<br>
