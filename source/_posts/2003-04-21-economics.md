Economist Joshua Aizenman is at the forefront of discussions of how to modify the global financial system to alleviate the types of financial crises that shook the world economy during the 1990s.

In a new policy brief, Aizenman argues that current proposals would fail the test of markets and politics.

Proposed reforms focus on reducing the probability of a crisis and helping bring about the swift resolution of any that should occur. Such strategies, although worthwhile, are insufficient, says Aizenman, who calls for pragmatic solutions that build on politically and financially proven institutions, including:  

* A more stringent application of capital and reserve requirements;  
* Coordination of regulations across countries by the Bank for International Settlements and the International Monetary Fund;  
* Coordination among creditors, and the formation of international bankruptcy procedures.  

Aizenman's analysis, "Reforming the Global Financial System," is available [online][1]. The policy brief is the second in a series published by the UCSC Center for Global, International, and Regional Studies.  

Aizenman, a professor of economics at UCSC, advocates mitigating the exposure of banks by imposing regulations on their reserves and capital. Although skeptical of proposals that would establish indicators of a nation's vulnerability, he acknowledges the challenge of designing "proper interventions."   

The Global Policy Brief web site showcases research and opinions on international matters of widespread interest and was designed to narrow the gap between academics, policy makers, and the public.
