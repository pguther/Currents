If you could use some extra help around the house, Alternative Spring Break students are hoping you'll give them a call.

The students' annual fundraiser supports a program sending students to build a home and help with community projects in Mexico over spring break. Alternative Spring Break is an international service project run by the Service Learning Program of College Nine and College Ten.

Students are available on weekends to work on general household tasks, such as painting, general gardening, and window washing. The person doing the hiring decides how much to donate to the Alternative Spring Break program.

To arrange a student work crew, e-mail [abecker@ucsc.edu][1] or call (831) 459-1864.
