  UCSC's early years are the focus of the University Library's fall quarter exhibit, "Dean E. McHenry and UC Santa Cruz: An Experiment in Higher Education, 1963-1974."<br>
  <br>
</p>The exhibit, on display from October 22 through January 13, documents the first decade of the campus's history, drawing on materials from founding Chancellor McHenry's archives, Special Collections, and the Regional History Project's oral history interviews with numerous campus pioneers.
<p>
  Newspaper clippings, maps, planning documents, books, photographs, letters, and artifacts are also part of the display.<br>
  <br>
  Randall Jarrell, director of the Regional History Project, will give a talk on early campus history at 3 p.m. on November 7 on the main floor of McHenry Library, adjacent to the exhibit. A question-and-answer period will follow.<br>
  <br>
  The exhibit focuses on planning and architecture, the genesis of the early colleges, town/gown relations, student life and activism, the Farm &amp; Garden project, key faculty and staff, the Narrative Evaluation System, and Lick Observatory.<br>
  <br>
  Exhibit curators are Irene Reti, assistant editor of the Regional History Project, and Mathew Simpson of the library's Online Archive of California unit, with assistance from Randall Jarrell, director of the Regional History Project.<br>
