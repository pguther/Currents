UCSC sent 14 staff members to the first UC Leadership Institute, held May 15-17 in San Diego. The program, sponsored by the Office of the President, was designed to help equip UC managers with the skills and knowledge to be effective managers and leaders within the UC system.

The program highlighted many of UC's senior leaders as keynote speakers, including Professor Martin M. Chemers, who spoke on "Heavy Mettle: The Role of Confidence and Optimism in Leadership Effectiveness." The program agenda and presentations are available at the following web site:[ www.ucop.edu/ucli][1]
