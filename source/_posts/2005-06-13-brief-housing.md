Plans to begin construction on 45 single-family homes at Ranch View Terrace, Phase I, the latest on-campus housing for faculty and staff, were approved May 25 by the UC Board of Regents.

Groundbreaking on the project is expected in middle to late August, with completion scheduled for fall 2006, said Faculty and Staff Housing manager Steve Houser.

The first phase of Ranch View Terrace will be composed of 20 three-bedroom houses and 25 four-bedroom houses. [Additional details on the project][1] (pdf file).
