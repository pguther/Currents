UCSC students are being asked to vote this week in an online election to determine whether they want to establish a fee to help maintain existing student programs threatened by budget cuts.

The Student Fee Advisory Committee (SFAC), a student committee that makes recommendations about funding student programs, is sponsoring this referendum. College governments, the undergraduate student government (SUA), and the graduate student government (GSA) have endorsed asking UCSC students to weigh in on this measure.  
  
The election is taking place through Sunday, March 9. To vote, go to:** [elections.ucsc.edu][1]**.
