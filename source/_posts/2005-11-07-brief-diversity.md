The campus community is invited to participate in a series of five forums on diversity during the month of November. The forums are designed to open a space for honest exchange about the strengths and weaknesses of current practices and to gather information about everyday interactions of campus life.

The forums are one part of a comprehensive study of the diversity climate at UCSC being conducted by the Committee on Affirmative Action and Diversity (CAAD) of the Academic Senate, with the support of the Office of the Chancellor. The discussions that take place at these forums will be recorded and transcribed.

Forums will be held at the following dates and times:

* Monday, **November 7**, 6 to 8:30 p.m., Guzman Room at Oakes College  
* Thursday, **November 10**, 9 to 11:30 a.m., Namaste Lounge at Colleges Nine and Ten  
* Wednesday, **November 16**, 2 to 4:30 p.m., Kresge Seminar Room 159  
* Friday, **November 18**, 9 to 11:30 a.m., Stevenson Fireside Lounge  
* Tuesday, **November 22**, 9 to 11:30 a.m., Baobab Lounge at Merrill College

In the project's second phase, at the start of winter quarter, CAAD will launch a web-based survey questionnaire. Every member of the campus community is encouraged to complete the survey.
