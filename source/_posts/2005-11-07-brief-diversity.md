  The campus community is invited to participate in a series of five forums on diversity during the month of November. The forums are designed to open a space for honest exchange about the strengths and weaknesses of current practices and to gather information about everyday interactions of campus life.
</p>
<p>
  The forums are one part of a comprehensive study of the diversity climate at UCSC being conducted by the Committee on Affirmative Action and Diversity (CAAD) of the Academic Senate, with the support of the Office of the Chancellor. The discussions that take place at these forums will be recorded and transcribed.
