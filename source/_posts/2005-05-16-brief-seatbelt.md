Drivers and passengers will get extra reminders to buckle up from May 16 through June 5, courtesy of the UCSC Police.

![][1]UCSC's officers are joining local and state police in the nationwide "Click it or Ticket" campaign administered by the National Highway Traffic Safety campaign.

A random sampling of vehicles will be checked randomly before and after the campus enforcement effort to see if compliance has increased; a two percent boost in seat-belt usage is the goal.

Tickets for a first offense seat-belt violation in Santa Cruz County are $101, with much higher fines if a vehicle is pulled over and a passenger under age 16 is unbuckled or improperly buckled.
