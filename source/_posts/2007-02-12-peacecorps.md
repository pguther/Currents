  UCSC has again made the Peace Corps' top 10 list for medium-sized schools, ranking eighth, with 41 alumni currently serving as volunteers.
</p>
<p>
  Since the inception of the Peace Corps, 598 alumni of UCSC have joined the ranks of the Peace Corps.

  "Peace Corps allows graduates to take their skills outside the classroom and make a real difference in the lives of people who can most use their help," said Peace Corps director Ron Tschetter. "The over 1,200 institutions of higher learning that have volunteers overseas, sharing what they have learned, should be proud of their contributions."
</p>
<p>
  Schools are ranked according to the size of the student body. Small schools are those with less than 5,000 undergraduates, medium-size schools are those between 5,001 to 15,000 undergraduates, and large schools are those with more than 15,000 undergraduates. (See the complete Peace Corps <a href="http://www.peacecorps.gov/index.cfm?shell=resources.media.press.view&amp;news_id=1176">Top Colleges</a> 2007 list.

<p>
  Since 1961, more than 187,000 volunteers have helped promote a better understanding between Americans and the people of the 139 countries where volunteers have served. Peace Corps volunteers must be U.S. citizens and at least 18 years of age. Peace Corps service is a 27-month commitment.
</p>
<p>
  Informational meetings about the Peace Corps are held on campus throughout the year for those thinking about becoming volunteers. The next meeting will take place on Thursday, February 15, from 6 to 7:30 p.m. at Charles E. Merrill Lounge at Merrill College. A Peace Corps representative and returned Peace Corps volunteer will answer questions and talk about their experiences with the Peace Corps.
