<p>
  Diversity and social justice will be the themes of a new campus lecture series for staff and faculty that opens with a talk by women's studies professor Bettina Aptheker on February 18.
</p>
<p>
  Aptheker will discuss women's oral histories and memoirs from noon to 1:30 p.m. in Conference Room D of the Bay Tree Building. Aptheker, who has just finished a first draft of her own memoir, will discuss the significance of women's life stories and the ways women remember things, narrate their stories, censor themselves, and are censored by others.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The talk is the opening event in the new UCSC Diversity Lecture Series sponsored by the Office of Equal Employment Opportunity/Affirmative Action (EEO/AA) that features presentations by faculty. The lectures are free and open to UCSC faculty and staff. Registration is required; to register, please send e-mail to <a href="tpchinn@ucsc.edu">Tiffany Chinn</a>.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "Our campus has a long history of discovering new knowledge in areas of diversity and social justice," said EEO/AA director Patti Hiramoto. "We wanted to offer a forum for our faculty to share their findings, current research, and thoughts on these issues with staff and other faculty."<br>
