Diversity and social justice will be the themes of a new campus lecture series for staff and faculty that opens with a talk by women's studies professor Bettina Aptheker on February 18.

Aptheker will discuss women's oral histories and memoirs from noon to 1:30 p.m. in Conference Room D of the Bay Tree Building. Aptheker, who has just finished a first draft of her own memoir, will discuss the significance of women's life stories and the ways women remember things, narrate their stories, censor themselves, and are censored by others.   

The talk is the opening event in the new UCSC Diversity Lecture Series sponsored by the Office of Equal Employment Opportunity/Affirmative Action (EEO/AA) that features presentations by faculty. The lectures are free and open to UCSC faculty and staff. Registration is required; to register, please send e-mail to [Tiffany Chinn][1].  

"Our campus has a long history of discovering new knowledge in areas of diversity and social justice," said EEO/AA director Patti Hiramoto. "We wanted to offer a forum for our faculty to share their findings, current research, and thoughts on these issues with staff and other faculty."  

The schedule of events follows (all events take place from noon to 1:30 p.m. in Bay Tree Conference Room D):
