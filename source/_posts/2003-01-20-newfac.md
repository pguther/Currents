  Jack Vevea is a quantitative psychologist with research interests in applied statistics, item response theory, mathematical models for bias in memory, and statistical methods for meta-analysis. He specializes in developing new statistical and mathematical models for psychological research. Vevea has developed models that combat the problem of publication bias in large meta-analytic data sets, and he is currently developing similar methods for smaller-scale analyses.<br>
