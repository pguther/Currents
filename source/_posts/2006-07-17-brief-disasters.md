  UCSC geophysicist Steven Ward and visiting researcher Simon Day are featured in "East Coast Tsunami," airing this week on the History Channel as part of the cable channel's <i>Mega Disasters</i> series. "East Coast Tsunami" airs at 9 p.m. on Tuesday, July 18.

  Ward and Day have studied the possibility of a catastrophic collapse of the west-facing facade of a volcano located in the Canary Islands. Such an event could generate a tsunami thatwould inundate the U.S. East Coast.
