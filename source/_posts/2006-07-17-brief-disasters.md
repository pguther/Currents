UCSC geophysicist Steven Ward and visiting researcher Simon Day are featured in "East Coast Tsunami," airing this week on the History Channel as part of the cable channel's _Mega Disasters_ series. "East Coast Tsunami" airs at 9 p.m. on Tuesday, July 18.

Ward and Day have studied the possibility of a catastrophic collapse of the west-facing facade of a volcano located in the Canary Islands. Such an event could generate a tsunami thatwould inundate the U.S. East Coast.

Ward was also featured in two other episodes in this series--"West Coast Tsunami" and "Asteroid Apocalypse"--which will be rebroadcast on July 22 and 23. More information about the _Mega Disasters_ series is available online at [www.historychannel.com/megadisasters][1].
