  The 19th Annual Prediction Walk/Run will be on Tuesday, June 13, from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. (Note the date change--the event usually takes place in May.) Any faculty or staff member from UCSC may participate in this fun fitness activity. You'll receive a free T-shirt and get the chance to win some not-so-fabulous prizes. Space is limited to the first 65 teams registered. The deadline to register is June 6.

  A Prediction Walk/Run is a relay. Each person on a team of four predicts his/her time to run or walk a distance of one-half mile at a comfortable pace. The captain of the team predicts how long, in minutes and seconds, the team will need to complete two miles (four half-mile laps). During the relay, one person from the team will hand a baton to the next person. Participants do not have to run or walk fast to win the event--the closest actual time to the predicted time wins! Bring your own creative baton and leave your watches at work!
