Whether you like yours fresh off the tree or baked in a tasty pie, apples will be a star attraction at the annual UCSC Harvest Festival on Saturday, October 9, from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.

The fall festival features live music, tasty food, and crafts for kids, as well as the ever-popular apple tasting and the third-annual Apple Pie Bake-Off (see below for entry rules). All events take place at the UCSC Farm. Admission is free for kids 12 and under and members of the Friends of the UCSC Farm & Garden; adult admission is $5; UCSC students are $3 with ID.

Kids of all ages enjoy hayrides and Farm tours, while youngsters can partake of face painting, pumpkin painting, and apple pressing. Adults are welcome to attend cooking and gardening workshops and to browse booths set up by community groups. See below for the full schedule of events.

In a new addition this year, members of the Culinary Alliance of Santa Cruz County will host a "Taste the Harvest" area featuring pumpkin, corn, tomato, and apple dishes. Delectable edibles will be available from many local restaurants, including The Buttery, Sand Rock Farm, Edith Meyer Wedding Cakes, Sweet Pea Cookie Company, Beckmann's Bakery, Malabar Trading Company, Sestri Restaurant, and University Center at UCSC. Chefs Jamie Smith of Sestri Restaurant and Christian Dreyfus will conduct cooking demonstrations, and local farmers will attend as part of the "Buy Fresh, Buy Local" campaign.

Major business sponsors include Christiansen Associates Organic Gardens & Design, New Leaf Community Markets, and Stonyfield Farm. For more information call (831) 459-3240.
