All eligible UC staff and non-Senate academic employees who are interested in serving as the 2006-07 staff advisor to the UC Board of Regents may apply during the period of January 17 through February 15.

A two-year program approved by the Board of Regents and instituted in 2005-06, the UC staff advisor pilot program is intended to allow the Regents to benefit from hearing staff and non-Senate academic employee perspectives on relevant matters that come before Regents' committees and the board.

The staff advisor will be selected from all eligible UC staff and non-Senate academic employees by President Robert C. Dynes in consultation with the chairman of the Board of Regents.

Complete information about the staff advisor pilot program can be found at [www.ucop.edu/staffadvisor][1].

The application form will be made available under "How to Apply" beginning Jan. 17.
