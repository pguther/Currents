You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll want to change the world, or at least go play in it for a while. The [Telluride's MOUNTAINFILM on Tour][1], which features the best selections from America's premier festival of mountain, adventure, cultural, and environmental film and video, is coming to town on Saturday, November 12, for one night only at the Rio Theater.

A benefit for the UCSC recreation scholarship fund, the program will consist of films varying in length and themes, from educational works about cultures and environments on the edge, to portraits of remarkable people, and adrenaline-pitched adventure and exploration.

The Rio Theater is located at 1207 Soquel Avenue in Santa Cruz. Doors open at 6:15 p.m.; films begin at 7 p.m. Tickets are $10/students and seniors, $12/general admission. Tickets may be purchased in advance at the UCSC Box Office, (831) 459-2159, and Pacific Edge Climbing Gym, (831) 454-9254.

For more information, call the Recreation Office at (831)459-2806 or go to the [film festival web site][1].
