Chancellor Denice D. Denton will be sworn in as UCSC's ninth chancellor as part of a series of fall events that will be short on ceremony and long on substance.

"Instead of spending resources on pomp and circumstance, we will invest in our academic priorities and our students," Chancellor Denton said. "The goal of the investiture period is to create an opportunity to celebrate UC Santa Cruz, advance diversity and excellence, support our students, engage our community partners, and stimulate and herald our future accomplishments."

UC President Robert C. Dynes will participate in a brief ceremony investing Denton as UCSC's chancellor on Friday, November 4, followed immediately by her inaugural address.

A symposium, "Achieving Excellence through Diversity," will take place on Thursday and Friday, November 3 and 4. On Thursday afternoon, Shirley Ann Jackson, 18th president of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, will deliver the keynote address; Jackson will also receive the third annual UCSC Foundation Medal.

On Saturday, November 5, Chancellor Denton will host UCSC's annual Scholarships Benefit Dinner--an event at which it was announced last year that more than $1 million in scholarships and fellowships for students had been raised. At this year's dinner, UCSC benefactor Jack Baskin will receive the foundation's first-ever Fiat Lux Award for service to the campus.

Events include:

**Symposium, Achieving Excellence Through Diversity: **Shirley Ann Jackson, president of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, will lead a discussion on the best practices in diversity, access, and inclusion. Thursday, Nov. 3, 2:30 p.m., Media Theater, and continuing at 8:30 a.m. on Friday, at College Nine/College Ten, with breakout sessions.

**Investiture of Chancellor Denton:** UC President Robert C. Dynes will preside over a brief ceremony investing Denice D. Denton as UCSC's ninth chancellor. Chancellor Denton's inaugural address will follow. Friday, Nov. 4, 1:30 p.m., Music Center Recital Hall.

**Scholarships Benefit Dinner:** The third annual Scholarships Benefit Dinner will celebrate the successful conclusion of the Cornerstone Campaign, while raising additional money to fund scholarships and fellowships. Saturday, Nov. 5, 6 p.m., University Center.

**Regional events:** UCSC is collaborating with partners throughout the region to host a variety of events this fall that offer the public additional opportunities to join in the celebration of the chancellor's arrival.
