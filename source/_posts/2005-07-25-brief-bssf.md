  It's not too soon to start thinking about the next Banana Slug Spring Fair, according to the Alumni Association.
</p>
<p>
  The Alumni Association is encouraging colleges, divisions and departments--as well as student groups and ethnic resource centers--to begin planning now for the April 22-23, 2006, reunion.
</p>
<p>
  Reunion events will include:<br>
  * The All-Alumni Reunion Luncheon, bringing together long-lost alumni friends, and reconnecting faculty with former students<br>
  * The Alumni Vintners Wine Tasting<br>
  * A panel discussion featuring graduates from the class of '76<br>
  * The Distinguished Faculty Lecture<br>
  * Affinity group, academic department, college-based, and other reunions
</p>
