It's not too soon to start thinking about the next Banana Slug Spring Fair, according to the Alumni Association.

The Alumni Association is encouraging colleges, divisions and departments--as well as student groups and ethnic resource centers--to begin planning now for the April 22-23, 2006, reunion.

Reunion events will include:  
* The All-Alumni Reunion Luncheon, bringing together long-lost alumni friends, and reconnecting faculty with former students  
* The Alumni Vintners Wine Tasting  
* A panel discussion featuring graduates from the class of '76  
* The Distinguished Faculty Lecture  
* Affinity group, academic department, college-based, and other reunions

Additional information on reunion planning is available by contacting Lynn Zachreson at (831) 459-5842, [lynnz@ucsc.edu][1], or checking the [Alumni Association web site][2].
