Housing office holding two information sessions  

Information sessions will be held July 14 and July 22 for faculty and staff members eligible to to purchase condominium units in the Laureate Court Apartments. Those wanting to learn more about UCSC housing policies are also encouraged to attend. Both sessions will be from 12:15 to 1:30 p.m. at the Women's Center.  

Laureate Court Apartments, adjacent to the main gate of campus, are 843-square-foot, two-bedroom, two-bath units. Thirteen of the units are available for sale. Because the purchases fall under UCSC and city housing policies, purchasers must meet UCSC and Santa Cruz City eligibility requirements. City eligibility limits income and assets for purchasers and includes preapproval by the Santa Cruz County Housing Authority, said Steve Houser, [faculty and staff housing][3] manager.

Staff members working 100 percent, and hired after July 15, 2003, are eligible to enroll on waiting lists for campus housing. These briefings will also address housing policy and the waiting list process. Those planning to attend are asked to RSVP to Faculty and Staff Housing at (831) 458-3506 or [facultyhousing@ucsc.edu

UCSC takes part in ham radio preparedness event  

A eclectic group of about 15 School of Engineering affiliates set up five antennas on East Field as they participated in Field Day, a continentwide amateur radio emergency preparedness exercise started in 1933 by  
the [Amateur Radio Relay League][5].

The antennas were set up June 26, then radio amateur teams were given 24 hours to make as many contacts as they could with other participating stations. Stations participating in the exercise are run on generated power in remote, temporary settings.

UCSC's participants managed the equipment and made 110 "continuous wave" contacts, via Morse code; 222 voice contacts; and 14 satellite contacts. Additional  
points were awarded for a public relations table which attracted about 20 visitors. An attempt to gain extra points with a weather-balloon-mounted antenna failed because of wind conditions.

Name change for UCSC Inn and Conference Center

The UCSC Inn and Conference Center will be knows as the University Inn and Conference Center beginning July 1. A new sign in front of the hotel will reflect the change.  

"The change of name comes from input our guests have given us over the course of the last couple of years. It is unclear from the name that hotel rooms are available to the general public," said Alma Sifuentes, director of Residential and Dining Services. "The change in name is a slight one," she said, "but we feel that it will make a significant difference in welcoming guests not affiliated with the university, particularly during summer months."
