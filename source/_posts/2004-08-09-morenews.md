</p>
<p>
  Three UCSC firefighters were part of a five-engine Santa Cruz County team helping put out the Pine Fire in the Angeles National Forest in mid-July.<br>
  Captain Brookes, engineer Tim Batinovich, and firefighter Coleen Canright responded with Engine 2730.

  In 2003, UCSC firefighters also responded to a call for assistance, sending a team to battle the devastating Cedar Fire east of San Diego (see <a href="http://currents.ucsc.edu/03-04/11-10/firefighters.html">Currents story</a>). Grateful residents of the Julian area later expressed their appreciation to Santa Cruz County firefighters (see <a href="http://currents.ucsc.edu/03-04/06-14/awards.html)">Currents story</a>).<br>
