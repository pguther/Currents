Live the adventure of a seven-day, 150-mile stage race along the west coast of Costa Rica with ultra endurance athlete [Terri Schneider][1]. On Friday, May 20, Schneider will give a talk and show slides of her experience as a participant in the Coastal Challenge Costa Rica adventure race. The presentation will be from 7 to 9 p.m. in Classroom Unit 1.

![][2]Schneider will take the audience on an epic adventure while inspiring the audience to embrace challenge as it appears in their own lives. Among the themes of her talk are the power of team, the virtues of risk, adapt or fail, and reach beyond potential. Schneider has given presentations on these themes to industry leaders at WalMart, Seagate Technology, Tyson Foods, and Cisco Systems.

The event includes music and raffle prizes, and there will be signed copies for sale of the book [_The Thrill of Victory, the Agony of My Feet][3]_, which includes a chapter about Schneider.

The cost is $5 for students, $8 general. Proceeds benefit the UCSC Recreation Program. The slide show is sponsored by OPERS, the Women's Center, Spokesman Bicycles, Fleet Feet Sports, World Gym, and Montrail.
