"Swimming in the stomach: Ulcer-causing bacterium _Helicobacter pylori_ and disease" is the title of the Winter 2007 Synergy Lecture by Karen Ottemann, associate professor of environmental toxicology. The lecture will take place on Thursday, March 8, at 4 p.m. in the Current Periodicals Room of the Science & Engineering Library. Light refreshments will be available.

Ottemann's research focuses on the swimming ability of the bacterium _Helicobacter pylori_ and its relationship to disease. In the past few decades, scientists have discovered that most ulcers are caused by _H. pylori._ This bacterium has many attributes that allow it to grow in the stomach and cause disease.

Ottemann's lab studies one of these attributes--the ability to swim. _H. pylori_ possesses several motors called flagellae, which it uses to propel itself. It does not swim at random, but navigates toward beneficial compounds and away from harmful ones. Ottemann investigates why _H. pylori_ has this ability and how it helps the microbe infect and cause ulcers. Her lab creates _H. pylori_ mutants that lack the ability to direct their swimming, and the researchers then study how these mutants differ from their normal parents.

Ottemann and her team have discovered that _H. pylori_ hunts down specific nutrients by swimming, and this ability helps it grow. The microbe also uses swimming to get close to the cells that line the stomach, where infection initiates the development of an ulcer.
