Thirteen faculty members and 10 teaching assistants have been honored for teaching excellence at UCSC.

Each spring the Academic Senate recognizes 10 or more members for exemplary and inspiring teaching.

Winners are selected by the Committee on Teaching from a group of nominees proposed by students. Nominated faculty submit statements on their teaching, and department chairs also weigh in with information about the nominees' teaching from the departmental perspective.

In making its choices, the Committee on Teaching looks first and foremost for evidence that the nominated instructor thinks deeply about pedagogy and applies that thinking in the classroom.   
  
The winners received a $500 prize and a framed certificate presented by Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood and Committee on Teaching chair Bruce Cooperstein on May 24 at University House and were announced at the final Academic Senate meeting of the year on May 17.

Winners were chosen on the basis of student nominations, letters of endorsement from department chairs, and individual statements on teaching.  
  
Teaching assistant award winners were selected by the Graduate Council and received stipends of $200 each.  
  
The faculty winners, and the wording on their certificates, are:   
  
**Kathy Anderson of Education:** For passion and dedication in the teaching of mathematics, fostering the best in her students both academically and professionally, for unparalleled enthusiasm working with teacher education candidates, and for actively modeling the interrelationships between teaching and learning.
