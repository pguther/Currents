The Financial Administrative Services and Transactions (FAST) office--the new organization responsible for making vendor and reimbursement payments--begins operations today, October 3, in the 2300 Delaware building.

FAST staff will process all purchase order-related invoices and direct payments, which include travel reimbursements and honoraria payments. A small satellite campus FAST office, located in Kerr Hall 165, also opens today to provide in-person service from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m., Monday through Friday. For more information, visit the [FAST office web site][1] or call the FAST hotline at (831) 459-4488.
