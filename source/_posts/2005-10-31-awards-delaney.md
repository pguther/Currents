Margaret Delaney, professor of ocean sciences, has been named editor of _Earth and Planetary Science Letters_, a major journal in the field of Earth sciences.

_EPSL_ is among the most highly visible and widely distributed journals published by Elsevier, a leading publisher of scientific journals. It covers research into all aspects of the geosciences, including lunar studies, plate tectonics, ocean floor spreading, and continental drift, as well as basic studies of the physical, chemical, and mechanical properties of the Earth's crust and mantle, the atmosphere, and the hydrosphere.

"It's very prestigious, one of the premier journals covering a broad range of research in Earth sciences, ocean sciences, and related fields," said Kenneth Bruland, professor and chair of ocean sciences.

Delaney's three-year appointment as editor of _EPSL_ began in September. She has previously served as editor of the journal _Paleocoeanography_. Delaney's research interests are in paleoceanography and marine geochemistry, especially the nutrient history of the oceans. She is a fellow of the American Geophysical Union and a director of the Geochemical Society.
