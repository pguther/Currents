The work of Hank Willis Thomas will be exhibited at the Sesnon Gallery October 2 through November 18. The show, titled "Signifying Blackness," includes photos from his B(r)ANDED and Unbranded series as well as from his recent body of work, "Winter in America."

Thomas has gained wide recognition with his series B(r)ANDED, a group of images in which he digitally adds a scarred Nike logo on the head and chest of black models. Thomas's work, using the branding metaphor with its uneasy historic associations with African American history, speaks about the extent to which commercial branding is geared to racial groups. His work raises questions about identity and commodification, acknowledging the violence confronting the African American community, through a visual language of the physical body, advertising logos, and marketing.

Thomas will give a lecture about his work on Monday, October 2, at 8 p.m. in the Porter Dining Hall. A reception for the artist will take place at the gallery on Thursday, October 5, from 5 to 6 p.m., followed by a conversation with Thomas and New York critic Isolde Brielmaier from 6 to 7 p.m. in the Baskin Arts Seminar Room D-101. The events are free and open to the public..

Gallery hours are Tuesday-Saturday noon to 5 p.m. The gallery is located at Porter College and is wheelchair accessible. Admission is free and parking is free on Saturdays. Group tours are available by appointment. Parking permits are available weekdays at the main campus entrance kiosk for $5.50/day and $2 at the Porter College lot between 5 and 8:30 p.m. for special events.
