A memorial fund has been established in memory of Kasey Chahal, a UCSC student who passed away in March. Kasey was a cherished Financial Aid Office student employee and friend to many on campus.

Kasey and her sister, a graduate of UC Davis, were both admitted to law school for fall 2006 and had planned to attend together. Proceeds from the fund will be used to support the dream they envisioned together and will be donated to Kasey's sister to help her in her educational pursuit.

If you would like to contribute to the fund, please make checks payable to "Kasey Chahal Memorial Fund" and in the memo field write: # 39949. Checks can be mailed to: Santa Cruz Community Credit Union, PO Box 1877, Santa Cruz, CA 95061-1877 or send checks to the UCSC Financial Aid Office c/o Erin Burns.

For more information, contact Erin Burns in the Financial Aid Office at (831) 459-4403.
