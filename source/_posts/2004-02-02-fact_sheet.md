_This fact sheet has been prepared by the office of Government & CommunIty Relations at UCSC._   

The Kindergarten-University Public Education Facilities Bond Act, Proposition 55, on the March 2 ballot, seeks voter approval for a $12.3 billion bond measure to relieve overcrowding, accommodate new enrollments, make overdue safety repairs, and upgrade California's elementary, middle and high schools, community colleges, and universities.

Proposition 55 is a general obligation bond that will not raise taxes.  

**Funding for Higher Education Facilities**  

If approved by voters, Proposition 55 would provide the three segments of higher education- the University of California, the California State University, and the California Community Colleges - with $2.3 billion. UC's share would be $690 million. Proposition 55 would provide about half of the amount necessary to fully fund UC's annual capital outlay needs in the coming years.  

Proposition 55 will help UC fund capital improvements in several areas:  

* **Earthquake and Life Safety:** The bond will help UC make seismic and other safety repairs in aging classroom, lab, and office buildings, including hospital facilities. UC has given seismic repairs a high priority in its capital program and is using the latest information from recent earthquakes around the world to make these safety improvements.  
* **More Space for Enrollment Growth: **Rapid enrollment growth over the past decade has made it essential to fix old and outdated classrooms, expand facilities, and build new classrooms to meet existing student needs at UC campuses--as well as California Community Colleges and CSU campuses. New UC facilities are needed to accommodate a surge of 64,000 additional students expected by 2010. This is greater than the current enrollments of UC Berkeley and UCLA combined.  
* **Create Tomorrow's Qualified Workforce: **It is essential that research and instructional facilities at UC campuses be upgraded as technologies and academic programs evolve. Several Prop. 55-funded projects would construct major new facilities for programs in engineering, environmental health and safety, and the sciences, fields that UC has targeted for expansion as part of our effort to continue to contribute to the economic and cultural climate of California. Additional information is available [online.][1]  

**Accountability and other provisions**  

The bill authorizing the bonds includes independent audits, cost controls, and other accountability safeguards against waste and mismanagement. These include amendments to the California Education Code that hold school districts and the university strictly accountable for the proper expenditure of funds. Funds can only be spent to repair or build schools, not on administration. According to the State Attorney General Summary on Prop. 55, "Funds will be targeted to areas of greatest need and must be spent according to strict accountability measures."  

It also includes provisions to increase energy efficiency in school buildings, tighten seismic safety standards, and establish standards for the distribution of school facility financing funds.  
  
**Target funds where they're needed most**  

Proponents and opponents both acknowledge that we need new schools. Prop. 55 targets funds to upgrade school facilities and repair and build classrooms where the need is greatest. Prop. 55 provides specific funding to build new schools in areas where classrooms are severely overcrowded and to fix schools that are old and rundown. New and growing communities also receive their fair share to build the schools and classrooms they need.  

**Create Jobs and Boost the Economy**  

School construction is a direct investment in the local economy. Studies show Prop. 55 will create hundreds of thousands of new jobs and add billions in local economic activities throughout California. "California's economy is capable of supporting Proposition 55," according to State Treasurer Phil Angelides. "It's a sound, prudent investment that will contribute to our future economic prosperity."  

**Supporters and Opponents**

opposing ballot argument include State Senator Rico Oller, the National Tax Limitation Committee, the [California Republican Assembly,][3] and the 60-Plus Association. www.protecttaxpayers.com
