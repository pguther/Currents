Non-represented staff employees will receive a $475 award this year, Willeen McQuitta, director of Staff Human Resources, announced in a [memo][1] posted June 8. The award, which is part of the 2005-06 Staff Recognition and Development Program, will be given to all eligible staff on June 16.  
  
The memo outlined the eligibility criteria:

* Employees are in title codes that are not exclusively represented.   
  
* Employees with career, partial-year career, by agreement, and limited appointments will receive the award based on their distribution percent time in the Payroll/Personnel System (PPS) in effect on June 1, 2006.   
* Awards for part-time employees will be prorated, based on the employee's distribution percent. The minimum award will be $100.   
* Employees must be on pay status for the period between January 1, 2006 and April 30, 2006 and must have received gross pay during this period.
* Employees must be active in the PPS (or on leave with or without pay) on June 1, 2006.   
* Employees with academic, student, or senior management appointments are ineligible for the award.
