The Boys & Girls Club of Santa Cruz is sponsoring a community-wide adult spelling bee on Sunday, October 16, from 2-5 p.m. at the Boys & Girls Club. The bee will raise money for the club's educational, civic, music, sports, and entrepreneurial programs for youth 7 to 18 years of age, as well as the club's expansion to Live Oak and Watsonville.

Local celebrity callers--including Chancellor Denice D. Denton, Santa Cruz Mayor Mike Rotkin, and Cabrillo College President Brian King--will pronounce the words.

Teams of three spellers will be challenged by words from the official Scripps Howard Bee Book--words as easy as "comet," and as arcane as "kamelaukion" (which are high hats worn by priests of Eastern rites). Fortunately for all, the spelling list is available for study upon receipt of entry.

The first-place team will receive $500 to give to the nonprofit(s) of their choice in Santa Cruz County, as well as trophies and bragging rights. The second place team will receive trophies.

To enter, each team must contribute/raise at least $400. All contributions are tax deductible. [Application forms][1] are available on the web or at the Boys & Girls Club and may be mailed to: Boys & Girls Club, P.O. Box 873, Santa Cruz, CA 95061.

For further information, call Julie Penniman at (831) 423-3138 ext. 29.
