Music professor Leta Miller has received a $24,000 fellowship from the National Endowment for the Humanities (NEH) for a book project titled "San Francisco's Musical Life, 1906-45." The award was designated as a _We the People_ grant--a special recognition given by the NEH for model projects that advance the study, teaching, and understanding of American history and culture.

This project builds on Miller's research in mid-20th-century American experimental music over the last decade. She has published two books on composer Lou Harrison, as well as a critical edition of his works for _Music in the United States of America_ (MUSA). Since 2000, Miller has also written more than a dozen articles on John Cage, Henry Cowell, Charles Ives, and others for such publications as _American Music, 20th-Century Music,_ the _Journal of Musicology, Musical Quarterly,_ and the _Journal of the American Musicological Society_. She is currently the executive director of the Arts Research Institute at UCSC.
