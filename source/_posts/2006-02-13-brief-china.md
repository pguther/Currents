Legends of China, a nonprofit organization that focuses on positive relationships between the U.S. and China, is sponsoring a summer trip to China. Join other UCSC and UC staff, students, faculty, and alumni on a trip that includes visits to the Great Wall, Tiananmen Square, and the Forbidden City.

The central event of the trip is a ceremony at the Great Wall where Chinese university students will join U.S. university students, staff, and faculty to celebrate world peace and good will between the two countries.

There are four trip options: (A) July 19-25: Beijing, $1,296; (B) July 19-25: Beijing, Shanghai, Suzhou, Hangzhou, and Zhouzhuang, $1,756; (C) July 19-30: add Seoul, Korea, to trip B for an additional $485; and (D) July 19-31: same as B or C plus Hong Kong $2,886.

Trip dates are tentative and may be slightly revised before departure. Prices include round-trip international airfare, four- or five-star hotels, three full meals each day (except free time), travel insurance, educational exchange events, ground transportation, historical site tickets, and guides. Tips, airport fees, and optional activities are not included.
