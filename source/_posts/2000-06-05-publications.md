The first book, from the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, addresses issues of diversity in teaching mathematics. Moschkovich's chapter is entitled "Learning Mathematics in Two Languages: Moving from Obstacles to Resources," which appears in <i>Changing Faces of Mathematics (Vol. 1): Perspectives on Multiculturalism and Gender Equity</i> (Reston, VA: National Council of Teachers of Mathematics, 2000).

  Moschkovich also coauthored a chapter with Mary Brenner, an associate professor of education at UC Santa Barbara, for a collection of writings by math and science education researchers describing the methodologies they use to conduct research. Their chapter, entitled "Integrating a Naturalistic Paradigm into Research on Mathematics and Science Cognition and Learning," appears in the new book <i>Handbook of Research Design in Mathematics &amp; Science Education</i> (Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 2000).<br>
