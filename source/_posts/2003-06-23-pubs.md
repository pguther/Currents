Gordon also authored "From Gangs to the Academy: Scholars Emerge by Reaching back through Critical Ethnography," which appeared in _New Pedagogies for Social Change,_ a volume published by the academic journal _Social Justice: A Journal of Crime, Conflict and World Order._ A review of the article appeared in the _Chronicle of Higher Education._  

Patricia Zavella

![][2]Patricia Zavella, professor of Latin American and Latino studies, coedited the new book, _Perspectives on Las Americas: A Reader in Culture, History, and Representation_ (Oxford, England: Blackwell Publishing, 2003).  

The book examines the historical, cultural, economic, and political integration of Latina/os across the Americas and demonstrates the limits of neatly demarcating the regions of "Latin America" and the "United States."  

The field of area studies has been transformed in recent years as political economies have changed and new theoretical frameworks have gained influence. Zavella and her coeditors compiled a collection designed to challenge the barriers between Latina/o studies and Latin American/Caribbean studies. Perspectives on Las Americas provides a core text that offers instructors, students, and interested readers the theoretical tools and case studies necessary to rethink transnational realities and identities.  

Zavella's coeditors are Matthew C. Gutmann, Felix V. Matos Rodriguez, and Lynn Stephen.
