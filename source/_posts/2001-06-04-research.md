Ulcer-causing bacteria, electronic micro-coolers, water flow beneath glaciers, and a comparison of human and mouse genomes were among the topics of research posters presented by UCSC undergraduates at the 2001 Undergraduate Research Poster Symposium on Thursday, May 31. More than 35 students in the Division of Natural Sciences and the Jack Baskin School of Engineering presented their research at the symposium, held in the Thimann courtyard.  
  
Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood told the students that she was proud of their accomplishments. "The opportunity for undergraduates to conduct research under the guidance of faculty who are leaders in their fields is one of the things that make this campus special," Greenwood said.   
  
The poster symposium provides students with the experience of presenting their research results in a professional setting. The event was one of many activities held on campus during Student Achievement Week.  
  
Support for the poster symposium was provided by UCSC Foundation trustee John Halliday and his wife, Layne.
