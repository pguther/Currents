  <a name="Lecture" id="Lecture"></a><font color="#003399">Lecture and seminar on the history of aerial attack</font>
</h3>
<p>
  Acclaimed Swedish writer Sven Lindqvist will present a lecture and seminar sponsored by the Center for Cultural Studies. The lecture, titled "Bombing the Savages in International Law and Military Practice," is Thursday, February 14, at 4 p.m. in the Bay Tree Conference Room D; the seminar, titled "A History of Bombing," is Friday, February 15, at 10 a.m. in the Oakes Mural Room.
</p>
<p>
  Sven Lindqvist is known internationally for his books on China and Latin America. His new book, <a href="http://www.thenewpress.com/books/histbomb.htm"><i>A History of Bombing,</i></a> translated from the Swedish by Linda Haverty Rugg, traces bombing through the centuries as a fundamentally racist act, something honorable soldiers would only inflict on rebels, savages, and infidels. <i>A History of Bombing</i> was universally praised on its publication in Sweden and was awarded several prizes, including a major prize from the Swedish Academy. His previous works available in English include <a href="http://www.thenewpress.com/books/extermin.htm"><i>Exterminate All the Brutes</i></a> and <a href="http://www.thenewpress.com/books/skull.htm"><i>The Skull Measurer's Mistake</i></a><i>.</i><br>
  <br>
  Both the lecture and the seminar are free and open to the public. Seminar participants should prepare by reading excerpts from <i>A History of Bombing</i>, available by contacting the Center for Cultural Studies at (831) 459-4899.<font color="#993300"><br></font><a href="#Theater"><i>Back to top</i></a>
