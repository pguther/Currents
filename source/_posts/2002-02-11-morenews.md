### Lecture and seminar on the history of aerial attack

Acclaimed Swedish writer Sven Lindqvist will present a lecture and seminar sponsored by the Center for Cultural Studies. The lecture, titled "Bombing the Savages in International Law and Military Practice," is Thursday, February 14, at 4 p.m. in the Bay Tree Conference Room D; the seminar, titled "A History of Bombing," is Friday, February 15, at 10 a.m. in the Oakes Mural Room.

Sven Lindqvist is known internationally for his books on China and Latin America. His new book, [_A History of Bombing,_][5] translated from the Swedish by Linda Haverty Rugg, traces bombing through the centuries as a fundamentally racist act, something honorable soldiers would only inflict on rebels, savages, and infidels. _A History of Bombing_ was universally praised on its publication in Sweden and was awarded several prizes, including a major prize from the Swedish Academy. His previous works available in English include [_Exterminate All the Brutes_][6] and [_The Skull Measurer's Mistake_][7]_._  
  
Both the lecture and the seminar are free and open to the public. Seminar participants should prepare by reading excerpts from _A History of Bombing_, available by contacting the Center for Cultural Studies at (831) 459-4899.
