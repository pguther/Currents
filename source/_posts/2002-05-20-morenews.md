  <a name="$1"></a><font color="#003399"><b>$1 million grant funds West Coast biodiversity surveys</b></font>
</h3>
<p>
  UCSC biologists have received a $1 million grant from the U.S. Department of the Interior to conduct a biological inventory of coastal areas from San Diego to Washington. Peter Raimondi, associate professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, is the project's principal investigator.
</p>
<p>
  The new project complements the work Raimondi and associate professor of ecology and evolutionary biology Mark Carr are doing as principal investigators in the Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans (PISCO), a multi-institutional project funded by the David and Lucile Packard Foundation. The PISCO project is focusing on the connections among the nearshore biological communities along 1,200 miles of coastline from southern California to Oregon.<br>
  <br>
  "With this additional money, we can do a more detailed investigation of biodiversity, and we can extend the range to include the whole West Coast of the U.S.," Raimondi said.<br>
  <br>
  The researchers will do formal biodiversity surveys of the intertidal zone at 66 sites. This involves mapping the topography of the area, then mapping the distribution of all of the plant and animal species found at the site.<br>
  <br>
  "There's more to it than just counting species. We are creating three-dimensional maps of the sites, with all of the species layered on top of the topography, so that we can see how habitat affects the numbers and types of species," Raimondi said.<br>
  <br>
  The resulting data is allowing the scientists to address questions such as how human activities affect biodiversity along the coast.<br>

  <a name="15th"></a><font color="#003399">15th annual Prediction Walk/Run a big hit with staff</font>
</h3>Teams of mostly staff members from all over campus showed that fitness can be fun as they walked, jogged, and ran around the East Field Track last week at the 15th annual Prediction Walk/Run. Seventy-one teams, with four people each, vied for prizes in the event, which took place May 14. All participants received a free T-shirt and refreshments.<br>
<br>
Prizes went not to the fastest teams, but to those most accurately predicting how long it would take their team to walk or run the two-mile relay race. The competition for the best costume/baton, in which the winner was chosen by applause, gave teams an opportunity to display their creativity and distinctive office personalities. The top prizes were gift certificates for kayaking, sailing, and outdoor equipment rental.
<p>
  <b>First place</b> went to the "Physical Plant Phlyers," made up of Peter Butterworth, Sue Carter, George Williams, and Juergen Wunder (two seconds over their prediction).<br>
  <br>
  <b>Second place</b> was "E Z Duz It," with Margie Harris, Eric Brewer-Garcia, Susan Walsh, and Glenda Dixon (three seconds under their prediction).<br>
  <br>
  <b>Third place</b> went to "Rembrandt's Recharges," with Rebekah Fessenden, Gayle Berry, Ruth Mutch, and Mary Keelin (four seconds under their predicted time).<br>
  <br>
  The event was sponsored by OPERS, with prizes, refreshments, and additional support provided Staff Human Resources and the Bay Tree Bookstore.<a href="#All"><i><br>
