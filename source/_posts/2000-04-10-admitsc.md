For college-bound high school seniors, spring is dominated by preparation for college life, and one of the biggest decisions for most students is where they will go to school in the fall. UCSC has sent out letters of admission to students across the state and country, and now begins the process of helping students decide if UCSC is the campus for them.

"We received a record number of applications, and our staff worked hard to evaluate them," said J. Michael Thompson, associate vice chancellor for outreach, admissions, and student academic services. "We are very pleased with the academic qualifications and diversity of students to whom we've made admissions offers."  
  
The campus has planned a series of events to help prospective students learn more about UCSC, including the [Banana Slug Spring Fair][1], the campus's annual open house, which will be held this year on Saturday, April 15.   
  
While applications to UCSC were up 12 percent over last year to a total of 20,260, the campus will only be able to accommodate an entering class of 3,700, said Thompson.

The average grade-point average of students who have been admitted to UCSC for the fall quarter is 3.62, and the average SAT score is above 1100, he said. In addition, 135 students are being considered for Regents Scholarships, the most prestigious academic award offered by the UC system to incoming students.
