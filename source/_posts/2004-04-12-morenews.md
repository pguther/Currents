  <a name="arboretum" id="arboretum"></a>Arboretum will hold annual Spring Plant Sale on April 17
</p>
<p>
  The <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/arboretum/">Arboretum</a> will hold its annual Spring Plant Sale on Saturday, April 17, from 10 a.m. to noon for members only and from 12 to 4 p.m. for the general public. The sale, held in conjunction with the California Native Plant Society, will take place at the Arboretum's Eucalyptus Grove on High Street near the intersection with Western Drive.<br>
</p>
<p>
  This annual plant sale is unlike any other, featuring both highly exotic plants and plants native to the local area. There are plants that have been imported from Australia, South Africa, and New Zealand, as well as unusual forms of California native plants that have been collected by Arboretum staff. For its part, the California Native Plant Society sells only California natives, including some propagated from local plant populations in Santa Cruz County. Several kinds of native bulbs will be available this year.<br>
</p>
<p>
  This year many of the batches of plants are small, so some species may sell out either in the members-only sale or early in the public sale, said Stephen McCabe, research and education coordinator for the Arboretum. Memberships can be purchased on the day of the sale for $25.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The Arboretum is open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. every day. Norrie's Gifts is open daily from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.<br>

  <a name="goode" id="goode"></a>Joe Goode Performance Group presents dance and theater April 17, 18
</p>
<p>
  San Francisco's <a href="http://events.ucsc.edu/artslecs/ARTISTS.03-04/Goode.html">Joe Goode Performance Group</a> will present its boundary-breaking contemporary dance theater at UCSC Theater Arts Mainstage on April 17 at 8 p.m. and April 18 at 7 p.m. Combining story, song, and humor with deeply physical, high-velocity dance, Joe Goode is more than dance and more than theater.
</p>
<p>
  The group will present its new work, <i>Folk</i>, which reveals "rural" dwellers in all of their complexity and contradictions. All members of this superb company move, sing, speak, and act equally well, completely integrating music, storytelling, and dance while presenting refreshingly alternative, nonstereotyped characters.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Tickets are: Gold Circle $40; adults $25; students and seniors with ID $20; UCSC students with ID $12. Contact the UCSC Ticket Office (open Tu.-Sat., 12-4 p.m.) at (831) 459-2159 (v/tdd), <a href="mailto:tickets@ucsc.edu">tickets@ucsc.edu</a><br>

</p>
<p>
  The University of California libraries are demonstrating their commitment to supporting innovations that provide wider dissemination and facilitate easier research access to scholarly publishing by become an institutional member of the Public Library of Science.<br>
</p>
<p>
  With a mission to make scientific and medical literature a public resource, the Public Library of Science (PLoS) is a nonprofit organization that was founded in 2000 by Nobel laureate, former National Institutes of Health director, and UC San Francisco faculty member Harold E. Varmus and colleagues.

<p>
  On their web site devoted to reshaping scholarly communication, the <a href="http://libraries.universityofcalifornia.edu/scholarly/">libraries of UC's 10 campuses</a> note that comprehensive access to the expanding volume of scholarly materials necessary for research and teaching is at risk for UC as it is for higher education generally.

</p>
<p>
  The University of California web site, <a href="http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/admissions/youcan/welcome1.html">"You Can, We Can Help,"</a> has been updated and tells new stories of how current UC students finance their college education.<br>
  There are many new faces on the web site and among them are:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>A junior at UCLA who saved money during high school and made it to college from a tough East Los Angeles neighborhood.<br>
  </li>
  <li>A senior transfer student at UC Santa Cruz who attended college on need based-grants and studied anthropology, and now intends to use her skills helping communities in India.<br>
  </li>
  <li>One student-parent who took 15 years to make it to UC Riverside and gets enough grant and loan assistance to raise her two children while attending college.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The student profiles demonstrate for prospective and current UC students the wide range of financial aid resources available and show how students at a variety of income levels meet the challenges of paying for a UC education.<br>
