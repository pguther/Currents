The tentative agreement provides wage increases for 1999-2000, 2000-2001 and 2001-2002 budget years. The contract would expire September 30, 2001. The university's 2001-02 proposed budget, which will be presented to the UC Board of Regents during the week of November 13-17, includes an additional augmentation for staff salaries that lag behind the market averages.

  "We are very pleased to have reached tentative contract agreements in these four negotiations," said Judith W. Boyette, UC associate vice president for human resources and benefits. "We are particularly proud to have reached our first tentative agreement with CUE on the clerical unit contract. Many of these contracts contain the first steps in a multi-year plan to bring our employees' salaries up to market averages."
