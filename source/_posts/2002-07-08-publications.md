![book cover ][1]The Third Edition of _Plant Physiology_ by Lincoln Taiz, professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology at UCSC, and Eduardo Zeiger, professor of biology at UCLA, has just been published by Sinauer Associates of Sunderland, Mass. Taiz and Zeiger's book has become the standard university-level textbook on plant physiology, and has been widely adopted by colleges and universities throughout the United States.  

The new edition tailors the study of plant physiology to a broad range of students, providing the basics for introductory courses without sacrificing the more challenging material sought by upper-division and graduate-level students. Many new and revised figures and photographs (now in full color) and a glossary of key terms have been added. The Third Edition also features an interactive web component keyed to the textbook chapters and referenced from the book.   

As in the earlier editions, the new edition features chapters by nearly two dozen contributing authors, each writing on his or her area of expertise. Contributing authors include Jane Silverthorne, associate professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology, who wrote the chapter on phytocrome. Taiz wrote the introductory chapter, the chapter on gene expression and signal transduction, and parts of many other chapters.
