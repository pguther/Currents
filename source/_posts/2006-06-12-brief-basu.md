UC President Robert Dynes lauded UCSC's Satyajit Ray Film and Study Collection (Ray FASC) at a recent U.S.-India Summit on Education, Research and Technology that took place at the UC San Diego campus. The event was designed to celebrate the long-standing partnership between the University of California and the academia, industry, and government of India. Ray FASC is directed by UCSC associate professor of history Dilip Basu.

"Dilip made history himself in 1992 when he was sent to India by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to present a Lifetime Achievement Oscar to his ailing mentor, director Ray," Dynes noted. "Since that time, Dilip has devoted himself to preserving the legacy of that great Indian filmmaker ... he has helped establish this world-class archive."

Dynes also acknowledged UCSC's Indian classical music endowments in his address, concluding: "the arts and humanities are, and will remain, a key part of the UC-India collaborative portfolio."
