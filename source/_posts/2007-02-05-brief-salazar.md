Author and media critic [Norman Solomon][1] will receive the third annual Ruben Salazar Journalism Award at 7 p.m. on Wednesday, February 7, in the College Nine/College Ten Multipurpose Room.

A question-and-answer period will follow the event, which is free and open to the public.

A nationally syndicated columnist on media and politics since 1992, Solomon has written 11 books. The latest, _War Made Easy: How Presidents and Pundits Keep Spinning Us to Death,_ was published in July 2005. Solomon is also founding director of the [Institute for Public Accuracy][2], which facilitates communication between independent policy analysts and working journalists.

The annual award honors the memory of independent journalist Ruben Salazar, who was killed during a Vietnam War protest in East Los Angeles when he was hit in the head by a police tear gas canister. Democracy Now! host Amy Goodman and cohost Juan Gonzalez are previous award winners.

Solomon's appearance is a College Ten cocurricular event. For more information, call (831)-459-1253 or e-mail [astuart@ucsc.edu][3]
