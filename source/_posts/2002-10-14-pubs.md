Nate Mackey

Literature professor Nathaniel Mackey's poetry has been included in [_African American Poets: Lives, Works, and Sources_][1] (Greenwood Press, 2002). The "biocritical" dictionary features 46 poets and includes a brief biographical sketch for each, a discussion of selected poems, and reference material for each entry.   
  
This reference volume is introduced with an overview of the significant developments and contributions in African American poetry, from the 18th-century poetry of Phillis Wheatley, through the major arts movements including the Harlem Renaissance and the Black Arts Movements of the 1960s, up to the present time.

Alva Noe

Assistant professor of philosophy Alva Noe has edited and written the lead article in _Is the Visual World a Grand Illusion?,_ a special issue of the [_Journal of Consciousness Studies][2]._ The issue is devoted to questions of perceptual consciousness arising from recent work in psychology on change blindness, inattentional blindness, and related phenomena.
