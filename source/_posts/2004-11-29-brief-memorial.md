  A cemetery-like art installation commemorating the deaths of U.S. military personnel in Iraq has been moved to the grassy area just outside the Women's Center.
</p>
<p>
  The memorial will be on display until December 2.
</p>
<p>
  The installation was displayed earlier on the grassy quad between Colleges Nine and Ten.
</p>
<p>
  Monterey antiwar activist and Army veteran Ed Leeper created the memorial, which has also been displayed in Monterey's Window on the Bay Park.
