A cemetery-like art installation commemorating the deaths of U.S. military personnel in Iraq has been moved to the grassy area just outside the Women's Center.

The memorial will be on display until December 2.

The installation was displayed earlier on the grassy quad between Colleges Nine and Ten.

Monterey antiwar activist and Army veteran Ed Leeper created the memorial, which has also been displayed in Monterey's Window on the Bay Park.
