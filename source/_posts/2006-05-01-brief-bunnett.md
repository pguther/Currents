<p>
  Paul A. Wender, the Bergstrom Professor of Chemistry at Stanford University, will give the 6th annual Joseph F. Bunnett Research Organic Chemistry Lecture on Friday, May 5. The lecture will take place at 5 p.m. in the Baskin Engineering Auditorium, preceded by a reception in the new Physical Sciences Building at 4 p.m.
</p>
<p>
  The title of Wender's lecture is "Molecular Evolution and Revolution: The Unique Role of Chemistry in Creating New Therapies, New Reactions and New Drug Delivery Systems."
</p>
<p>
  Wender is a cofounder, adviser, and board member of CellGate, a biotechnology company developing new strategies for drug delivery. His research group investigates the design and mechanism of action of molecules that exhibit unique biological activity and therapeutic potential. Wender's group is also concerned with new ways of synthesizing such compounds and has completed more than 50 syntheses. These include a wide range of targets, such as taxol, a potent anticancer drug; phorbol, an agent that is central to understanding the molecular basis for tumor promotion; and resiniferatoxin, a new lead for treating neuropathic pain. His group's work is described in over 220 publications.
</p>
<p>
  The Bunnett Lecture is hosted by the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry in honor of Professor Emeritus Joseph Bunnett. For additional information about the lecture, please call the Chemistry Department at (831) 459-4002.
