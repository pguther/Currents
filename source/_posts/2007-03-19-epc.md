  Watsonville mayor Manuel Bersamin and the Watsonville City Council issued a formal proclamation on March 13 recognizing the impact of the UC Santa Cruz <a href="http://epc.ucsc.edu/">Educational Partnership Center</a> (EPC) and its many academic preparation programs serving students, families, teachers, and schools in Watsonville and the Pajaro Valley area.
</p>
<p>
  Mayor Bersamin described the EPC as an "engine of educational attainment," assisting the youth and larger community of Watsonville to "greater economic, social, and educational advancement." EPC programs such as the <a href="http://www.eaop.org/welcome.html">Early Academic Outreach Program</a>, <a href="http://epc.ucsc.edu/epcprog.html">GEAR UP</a>, and MESA Schools program act as a catalyst for students and provide opportunities for them to explore options beyond high school, said Bersamin.
</p>
<p>
  EPC staff members told the council about their work with students, and students described the impact the programs had had on their lives.
</p>
<p>
  "With the help of MESA, I can see that engineering is for me," said Alejandro Lobato, who has been accepted to Santa Clara University and will start in fall 2007.
</p>
<p>
  Carrol Moran, EPC executive director, accepted the proclamation along with Pablo Reguerin, deputy director. Other UCSC administrators in attendance were Jean Marie Scott, acting vice chancellor, student affairs; Donna Murphy, vice chancellor, university relations; Elise Herrera-Mahoney, assistant vice chancellor, student affairs; and Donna Blitzer, director of government and community relations.
</p>
<p>
  The Educational Partnership Center coordinates new and ongoing UCSC outreach efforts, with the goal of increasing access and opportunity to higher education for students across the Monterey Bay and San Jose/Silicon Valley regions.
