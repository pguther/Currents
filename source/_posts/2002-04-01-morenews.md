### City installs new 'contraflow' bike lane on High Street

Santa Cruz city workers recently installed a "contraflow" bike lane on High Street between Storey Street and Highland Avenue. The route is popular among bicyclists riding to and from campus. But the ride home on that section of High has been illegal because it was against traffic.

The lane--the first of its kind in Santa Cruz--was approved by the City Council on a six-month trial basis. With the specially marked lane in place, eastbound bicyclists are able to travel against the one-way westbound flow of motor traffic, said Cheryl Schmitt, the city's bicycle/pedestrian coordinator.

"To make this project a success and advocate for its continuation," it is important that users abide by the following rules: stop at Storey Street before proceeding eastbound in the contraflow bike lane; be aware that motorists may cross the contraflow bike lane to park on the south side of the street; stop at the new stop at Highland Avenue; yield to all pedestrians in crosswalks; and walk their bikes on the pedestrian bridge over Highway 1.

### New short-term parking spaces now available in Core West Parking Structure

Guests, visitors, and others in search of short-term parking in the Science Hill area now have 19 new parking spaces for their use on the second level of the Core West Parking Structure. These spaces are available for up to two hours.

When you park in any of the 19 designated "stall" spaces, note your space number, and then visit the pay station located by the elevator at the Steinhart pedestrian entrance. Payment can be made with coin, cash, or your MasterCard or Visa credit card. Once payment is made there is no need to return to your vehicle to place a validation on your dash; the pay station records your payment electronically. The pay station also makes change for $5, $10, and $20 bills.

Departments located near the Core West Parking Structure will want to be sure to inform potential guests and visitors of this new parking option offered by TAPS. Please note that A and B permit holders need to pay the fee at the pay station to park in these spaces, as is required of permit holders when parking at meters on campus.
