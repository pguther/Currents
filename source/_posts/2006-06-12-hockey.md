Beth Ann Hockey, a visiting professor of linguistics, has coauthored a book on the Regulus grammar compiler, an open-source software toolkit that her research group has helped develop.

Hockey, a researcher at the University Affiliated Research Center (UARC) at NASA Ames, leads the Clarissa project to develop an advanced spoken-dialogue system for NASA. Clarissa, which was tested by astronauts on the International Space Station last year (see earlier [story][1]), is one of several major speech-recognition projects to make use of Regulus.

Hockey's coauthors on the new book, _Putting Linguistics into Speech Recognition: The Regulus Grammar Compiler_ (CSLI Publications, 2006), are Manny Raymer, who also works on the Clarissa project at NASA Ames, and Pierrette Bouillon, project lead on the MedSLT medical speech translator project at Geneva University.

The authors will attend a book-signing event on Saturday, June 17, at 5 p.m. at Leigh's Favorite Books, 121 South Murphy Avenue, in Sunnyvale, (408) 736-2665.

"It's unusual to have a signing for an academic book, but our local bookstore thought it was a cool idea, and so did we, so it should be a rare and interesting event," Hockey said.
