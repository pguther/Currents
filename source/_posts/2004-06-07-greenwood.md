Campus and community members gathered June 3 to express their appreciation to former UCSC Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood, who left this spring to become UC provost and senior vice president of academic affairs.

Hosted by Acting Chancellor Martin M. Chemers, the UCSC Foundation, and the Alumni Association, the event was at the Cocoanut Grove Ballroom in Santa Cruz.
