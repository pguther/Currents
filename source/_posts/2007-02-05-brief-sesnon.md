Works by Erin V. Sotak will be on display at the [Sesnon Art Gallery][1] February 7 through March 17. Sotak is an installation and performance artist concerned with notions of absurdity, futility, consumption, labor, and aesthetics. Her work is best described as a moving tableau that is re-rendered through the photographic process. Sotak will fabricate a new space in the Sesnon gallery using a variety of materials including wood, wall coverings, raw silk, and pomegranates.

Running concurrently the Sesnon Project Space will show the environments of T. S. Anand. Anand is an interdimensional artist interested in creating thought provoking, visually stimulating, and trance inducing environments. Her mosquito net listening stations create energetic spaces that are sensually inviting and at the same time visually permeable. REST is the final installment of the Mosquito Net Trilogy. Part One premiered at the Tree Museum of Gravenhurst, Canada, in 2003 and was recreated last summer at Sierra Azul Nursery in Watsonville for the Pajaro Valley Arts Council. Part Two was presented in 2005 at the Cathcart Gallery in Santa Cruz especially for the Santa Cruz Institute of Contemporary Arts. Part Three opens at the Mary Porter Sesnon Gallery, UCSC, where T. S. Anand again invites her audience to experience for themselves the interface of art and life.

There will be a public reception on Wednesday, February 7, from 5 to 7 p.m. at the gallery, with performances by each of the artists.

Gallery hours are Tuesday-Saturday noon to 5 p.m. The gallery is located at Porter College and is wheelchair accessible. Admission is free and parking is free on Saturdays. For more information, visit the [Sesnon Gallery][1] web site.
