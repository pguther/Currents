Pulitzer Prize-winning author and cartoonist Art Spiegelman came to Santa Cruz Oct. 7 to present a public lecture. His visit, which was presented by [Arts & Lectures][1], also included a meeting with local schoolchildren who are creating their own comic book, presentations to students in the Porter core course and Kresge core course, and a press conference.

An exhibit of Spiegelman's work, including images from his Pulitzer Prize-winning books _Maus I_ and _Maus II,_ is on display at the [Sesnon Art Gallery][2]. The exhibit is titled, "CRASH! Comix and graphics by Art Spiegelman."

Spiegelman's visit was presented in partnership with Atlantis Fantasy World, Porter College, and Kresge College.
