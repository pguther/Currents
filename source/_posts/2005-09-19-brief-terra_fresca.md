The restaurant at the University Center has a new name and new management. UC Dining Services took over management from Sodexho in June and renamed the restaurant Terra Fresca to reflect the new emphasis on fresh local foods.

Restaurant staff spent the summer testing the menu, creating a more warm and inviting space, tightening procedures to quicken service time, and training staff, according to Julie Mitravich, head of operations and events at the restaurant.

Terra Fresca is open for lunch Monday through Friday, from 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. Over the summer, while staff were fine tuning the menu and operations, they offered a buffet lunch one day a week. It was so popular that they decided to make it a regular Friday feature this fall.

"The buffet is popular because it is a great value, with a large variety of choices. People can pace their lunch on their own timeline," said Mitravich.

Focusing on fresh, organic, and sustainable foods from Santa Cruz and the Central Coast region, the menu includes a selection of appetizers, soups, salads, sandwiches, entrees, and desserts, along with daily specials and a fresh catch of the day.

Terra Fresca's staff is headed by Mitravich and chef Greg Kuhn. The staff also includes sous chef Chris Wenger, line/pastry cooks Luis Fernando and Doug George, busser/dishwasher Miguel Cisneros, and daily operations coordinator Josh Martin.
