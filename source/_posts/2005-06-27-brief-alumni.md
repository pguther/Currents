More and more graduating seniors are deciding to stay connected to UCSC by joining the Alumni Association.

The Alumni Association said 1,247 graduating seniors have signed up for their free first-year membership so far this year. The sign-up rate has been increasing steadily in recent years; 936 graduating seniors joined in 2004, and 765 in 2003.

"We are thrilled that so many of our recent graduates are joining," said Lynn Zachreson. "As members, our recent graduates can stay connected with their classmates and friends, find a mentor through the online community, and add their voice to that of over 10,000 fellow members."  
Membership in the Alumni Association also includes various discounts and services.

Graduating seniors were contacted by the association when they picked up their caps and gowns at the bookstore as well as via e-mail. This year 141 graduates signed up via the [online community][1].

Additional information on the Alumni Association is online at [alumni.ucsc.edu][2].
