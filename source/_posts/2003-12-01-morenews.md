3,200 respond to dining services survey

A total of 3,200 people took the time to respond to a recent survey about dining services at UCSC. The survey was the latest step in the campus's preparations to take over campus dining services by June 20, 2004.  

More than 2,500 students returned a survey, said Carol Douglas-Hammer, assistant director for Student Housing Services. The surveys were distributed via e-mail to students, faculty, and staff October 24-31. Two separate surveys were developed by two independent consulting firms. The surveys were commissioned to help managers develop a multiyear master plan for campus dining services. Implementation will begin June 20, 2004, when transition to self-operation is complete.   

Self-operation is more in keeping with the values and mission of the university and with the expectations of students, said Douglas-Hammer. It also offers dining services staff the opportunity to be UC employees, and it gives the campus greater say in shaping the dining services program.  

A total of 2,517 students, 579 staff members, and 104 faculty members returned a survey, according to Douglas-Hammer. Everyone who completed a survey was eligible to win a prize; winners were notified via e-mail. Winners of digital cameras were Carl Jason Corringe, Ruby Lipsenthal, Cheryl Lira, and Malia Paik-Nicely. Danielle Nicole Murillo and a person whose name was withheld won MP3 players, and Tami Greene and Jonathan Horn won $100 in Flexi Dollars. Fifteen others won $25 gift certificates to Bay Tree Bookstore or the University Center.   

The results will be part of a master plan that will be delivered to the campus on January 5. Updates on the dining services transition will be posted [online][10]. Additional information is available by [e-mail][11].
