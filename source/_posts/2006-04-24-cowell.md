Cowell College will present "Author, Author!"--a reception in celebration of recent publications by Cowell faculty authors--on Monday, May 1, from 5 to 6:30 p.m. at the Cowell Provost House.

The event will spotlight eight books from a variety of disciplines, on topics ranging from English, Greek, and Latin literatures to linguistics, birdwatching, environmental policy, philosophy, and Renaissance studies. It was initiated by Cowell College provosts Tyrus Miller and Deanna Shemek.

"Author, Author!" is an opportunity for faculty affiliated with Cowell College to acquaint themselves with each other's scholarly work," said Shemek. "It allows them to enjoy one of the great benefits of the college system for UCSC intellectual life--the chance for faculty to participate meaningfully in a genuinely cross-disciplinary community. It is also a celebration, an opportunity to pause amidst a busy spring quarter to appreciate the contributions Cowell faculty make to their fields when they are not teaching or serving the university in other ways."

Shemek added that in the increasingly specialized world of academia, the college system has significant advantages for faculty:

"The college is one vital space of intellectual exchange that is not confined to departments and disciplines, a place where the chemist and the poet can participate in a broad community of scholarship for the sheer pleasure of the encounter. Faculty can get so busy that they relinquish this joy in exchange and adventure, sacrificing it in order to fulfill other campus duties; but that sort of denial brings about an impoverishment of the university as a whole, both for faculty and for students."

Shemek said that the idea for the event arose out of the realization that the best way to highlight both the diversity and the innovative character of the research conducted by Cowell faculty would be to simply recognize recent books. She noted that a similar event in the future could focus on works in economics, mathematics, theater arts, or biomolecular engineering.

Brief presentations of each book will begin at 5:30 p.m. followed by an informal reception where faculty can discuss the works. In the spirit of the diversity of the Cowell community, Shemek said that each book will be presented by a Cowell Fellow from a different discipline than the book's author. "For example, the classics professor's book will be presented by an anthropologist, the biologist's book on birding will be presented by a professor of environmental studies, and the environmental studies professor's book will be presented, in turn, by a philosopher," Shemek noted.
