  <a name="rustin" id="rustin"></a>Life of human rights activist Bayard Rustin is the subject of a documentary and discussion led by Paul Ortiz
</p>
<p>
  The film "Brother Outsider: The Life of Bayard Rustin" will be screened on Wednesday, February 26, from 7 to 9 p.m. in Oakes College Room 105. Paul Ortiz, assistant professor in the Department of Community Studies and co-author of the award-winning book <i>Remembering Jim Crow: African Americans Tell About Life in the Segregated South,</i> will lead a discussion on the film.<br>
  <br>
  Bayard Rustin is best remembered as the organizer of the 1963 March on Washington and for bringing Gandhi's protest techniques to the American Civil Rights Movement, and for helping Martin Luther King, Jr. become an international symbol of peace and nonviolence. The documentary focuses on Bayard Rustin's activism for peace, racial equality, economic justice, and human rights. The film also depicts how Rustin was silenced, threatened, arrested, beaten, imprisoned and fired from important leadership positions, largely because he was an openly gay man in a fiercely homophobic era.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The event, which is sponsored by the GLBT Resource Center and Oakes College, is free and open to the public.
