If the thought of sweet, flavorful strawberries brings a smile to your face, mark your calendar for Tuesday, June 6, because that's the day the popular campus market cart opens.

Enjoy the bounty of the UCSC Farm & Garden by shopping at the market cart, which is located at the main entrance of campus. The cart features picked-that-morning fruit, vegetables, and flowers. It will be open each Tuesday and Friday afternoon from noon until 6 p.m. in front of the Barn Theater at the intersection of Bay and High Streets.  
  
As always, the cart will offer colorful bouquets, featuring sweet peas, sunflowers, larkspur, alstroemeria, snapdragons, bachelor's buttons, feverfew, and more. The array of fresh organic fruits and vegetables grows as the season progresses, but early offerings include gourmet salad mix, tender lettuces, kiwis, beets, spinach, chard, kale, and green garlic. As summer unfolds, watch for potatoes, sweet corn, flavorful dry-farmed tomatoes, an array of sweet and hot peppers, apples, basil, and more.   
  
The cart will be open through the summer and into the fall, depending on the length of the growing season. All proceeds benefit the UCSC Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems' apprenticeship program in ecological horticulture. For more information, call (831) 459-3248.
