<p>
  Denice D. Denton's tenure as chancellor of UC Santa Cruz began today (February 14).
</p>
<p>
  The ninth chancellor in the campus's 40-year history, Denton issued a <a href="http://currents.ucsc.edu/04-05/02-14/message.asp">message to the campus community</a> and is hosting a number of introductory meetings. She also was treated to a <a href="http://currents.ucsc.edu/04-05/02-14/photos.asp">brief reception</a> by the staff in her office.
</p>
<p>
  During a busy first week on the job, the new chancellor will address UCSC's Academic Senate, join alumni in Sacramento for a UC-advocacy event, and launch a "listening tour" of the campus.
</p>
<p>
  Week Two will include a discussion with staff at a winter quarter forum.
