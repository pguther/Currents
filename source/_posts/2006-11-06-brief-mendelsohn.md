<p>
  The Humanities Division's Living Writers Series continues with an appearance by award-winning author, journalist, and critic Daniel Mendelsohn on November 8.
</p>
<p>
  Mendelsohn is one of a number of authors and poets coming to campus this academic year as part of the annual series coordinated by associate professors of literature Micah Perks and Karen Yamashita--codirectors of the UCSC Creative Writing Program.
</p>
<p>
  A frequent contributor to the <i>New York Review of Books</i>, Mendelsohn has written for numerous national publications including the <i>New Yorker, Esquire</i>, the <i>New York Times Magazine</i> and <i>Book Review</i>, the <i>Paris Review</i>, and <i>Travel + Leisure</i>, where he is a contributing editor. As weekly book critic for <i>New York</i>, he received the National Book Critics Circle Award for Excellence in Reviewing.
</p>
<p>
  Mendelsohn's new book, <i>The Lost: A Search for Six of Six Million</i>--the story of his search to learn about the fates of family members who perished in the Holocaust--was published in September by HarperCollins to critical acclaim in publications ranging from <i>People</i> magazine to the <i>New York Times</i>.
</p>
<p>
  The series concludes on November 29 with a reading by Heather Nagami, a just-published poet and a UCSC alumna, along with art critic and fiction writer Amra Brooks.
</p>
<p>
  The presentations will be held on Wednesday evenings from 7 to 8:30 p.m. at the Kresge College Town Hall, Room 466. Admission is free and open to the public.
