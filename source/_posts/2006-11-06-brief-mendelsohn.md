The Humanities Division's Living Writers Series continues with an appearance by award-winning author, journalist, and critic Daniel Mendelsohn on November 8.

Mendelsohn is one of a number of authors and poets coming to campus this academic year as part of the annual series coordinated by associate professors of literature Micah Perks and Karen Yamashita--codirectors of the UCSC Creative Writing Program.

A frequent contributor to the _New York Review of Books_, Mendelsohn has written for numerous national publications including the _New Yorker, Esquire_, the _New York Times Magazine_ and _Book Review_, the _Paris Review_, and _Travel Leisure_, where he is a contributing editor. As weekly book critic for _New York_, he received the National Book Critics Circle Award for Excellence in Reviewing.

Mendelsohn's new book, _The Lost: A Search for Six of Six Million_\--the story of his search to learn about the fates of family members who perished in the Holocaust--was published in September by HarperCollins to critical acclaim in publications ranging from _People_ magazine to the _New York Times_.

The series concludes on November 29 with a reading by Heather Nagami, a just-published poet and a UCSC alumna, along with art critic and fiction writer Amra Brooks.

The presentations will be held on Wednesday evenings from 7 to 8:30 p.m. at the Kresge College Town Hall, Room 466. Admission is free and open to the public.
