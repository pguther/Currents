<p>
  Andrew Fisher and Paul Koch, both professors of Earth sciences, have been elected fellows of the Geological Society of America in recognition of their significant contributions to the science of geology.
</p>
<p>
  Fisher's research focuses on physical and chemical hydrogeology on land and below the seafloor. He has done pioneering studies of the flow of water beneath the seafloor. On land, he is studying interactions between surface water and ground water.
</p>
<p>
  Koch uses isotope analyses and other techniques to study the ecology of extinct animals and plants and to investigate the influence of climate on the diversity and organization of continental ecosystems. He has used similar biogeochemical techniques to study African elephants and other modern organisms.
</p>
<p>
  Established in 1888, the Geological Society of America is dedicated to the advancement of the geosciences, uniting Earth scientists in a common purpose to study the mysteries of our planet and share scientific findings.
