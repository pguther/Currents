UCSC has been ranked 13th in the nation for fitness by _Men's Health_ magazine.

Top honors for "Fittest Colleges in America" went to Dickinson College in Pennsylvania. UCSC was the only UC campus in the top 25.

The ranking was based on student responses to questions on topics such as level of physical activity, cigarette and alcohol consumption, and whether the campus offers services such as extended gym hours and nutritionists, according to the [magazine article.][1]

The article appeared in the magazine's October 2006 issue.
