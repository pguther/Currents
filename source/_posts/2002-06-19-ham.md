  If you've ever wondered how people might communicate in a national emergency--with no power system and no telephones--you might want to stop by the East Field this weekend.
</p>The UCSC <a href="http://ieee.soe.ucsc.edu/ham">student branch</a> of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc. will be participating in Field Day, a three-day nationwide exercise and contest for ham radio operators organized annually by the national amateur radio organization, the <a href="http://www.arrl.org">American Radio Relay League</a><a href="http://www.aarl.org">.</a><br>
<br>
Field Day got its start as emergency preparedness training back in 1933, and continues to play a role in emergency communications. During Field Day, participants operate one or more amateur radio stations from a field location--such as from tents using generator power and portable equipment--to simulate emergency operation.<br>
<br>
"It's a good thing to be involved in. I think a lot of the hams are involved in it so they can spring into action in an emergency," said Alexandra Carey, one of the student organizers. Carey said most of the students on the UCSC team are computer science or computer engineering majors.<br>
<br>
Lecturer Steve Petersen, the IEEE student chapter adviser, is providing expertise in running field days and in providing equipment such as radios and generators, calling on his years of experience with the San Jose State Amateur Radio Club.<br>
Organizers also found a strong supporter in Electrical Engineering Department chair John Vesecky--also a longtime ham radio operator.<br>
<br>
"We hope that this event will become an annual tradition at UCSC, bringing together faculty, staff, students, alumni, and the Santa Cruz community for a weekend of talking to the world," said Robert L. Vitale, electrical engineer and laboratory manager at Baskin Engineering.<br>
<br>
UCSC's team--including faculty, staff and students--will set up at sundown Friday, June 21, in UCSC's East Field and camp out overnight. In addition to a few tents, the site will sprout some large antennas for the occasion. "It'll be a little bit obvious," said Carey.<br>
<br>
Members of the campus community are invited to stop by, from 11 a.m. Saturday, June 22, to 11 a.m. Sunday, June 23, to learn more about ham radio. Those interested in helping out in the high-frequency tent may <a href="mailto:fire@soe.ucsc.edu">e-mail</a> the group. Also, a last-minute ham radio exam has been arranged for 6 p.m. Friday, June 21, in Baskin Engineering Room 330. More information is available from the <a href="http://ieee.cse.ucsc.edu/ham/">IEEE chapter.</a><br>
<br>
While Field Day is geared toward emergency preparedness, scoring is also involved. Individuals or teams receive points for every contact made--one point for voice and two points for Morse code. Bonus points will also be assigned for such things as using 100 percent emergency power, and alternate forms of communication.<br>
<br>
Carey said the IEEE group at UCSC will be transmitting with 150 watts. The UCSC station will be communicating with other Field Day exercises in Santa Cruz and nearby areas, as well as across the state and nation.<br>
<br>
"I have no idea what to expect," she said of the team's likely contacts. "I'm assuming it will just be up and down the coast," said Carey, who has passed her technician-class operator's test and the Morse code test.<br>
<br>
While the Morse code test is no longer required of ham operators, Carey enjoyed learning Morse code. "It's a connection to history," she said.
