For the fifth time in school history, UCSC's men's tennis team captured a national championship. But this time, the feat was accomplished on the team's home courts as the host school thrilled hundreds of very enthusiastic Slug supporters with a 4-1 victory over top-ranked Middlebury College of Vermont.

The NCAA-installed scoreboard on the East Field courts kept the overflow crowd buzzing as UCSC captured the doubles point by winning the first two doubles matches, seesaw affairs that looked like they could go either way. (They were ahead in the third, as well, when the doubles point was awarded to UCSC).

When Matt Seeberger and Andrew Cohen captured their singles matches, all eyes turned toward Kevin Casey. When Casey overwhelmed his Middlebury opponent, 6-2, 6-1, a celebration at the East Field complex ensued, with players, families, friends, and other spectators rushing the court.

UCSC's tennis team also captured the Division III crown in 1989, 1995, 1996, and 1998.
