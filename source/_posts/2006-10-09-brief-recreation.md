The Recreation Department has openings in the following dance classes. Register online at [www.ucscrecreation.com][1] or visit the Recreation Office at the East Field House (831) 459-2806.

**West African Traditional Dance  
**Mondays, Oct. 9 - Nov. 6; 7:30 - 9 p.m.   
Multipurpose Room, East Field House. Cost: $35.   
The class starts with dance warm-ups and fundamentals and goes on to practice inside traditional West African dance steps. Each dance has its own rhythm and history and will be accompanied by a mix of live drumming and recorded music. Each class ends with stretching and cool-down. The instructor is Deb Voisin, who has studied and practiced West African dance intensely for seven years and taught for two.

**Polynesian Dance**  
Fridays, Oct. 13 - Nov. 3; 7 - 8:30 p.m.  
Dance Studio, East Field House. Cost: $20.   
Learn the sacred and festive dances of Hawaii and Tahiti. This six week class introduces you to the graceful and strengthening basics of hula and Tahitian dance as well as some Hawaiian and Tahitian language and culture. Instructor Lorraine Kinnamon has over 30 years experience and has performed Polynesian dance around the world.

**Contra Dance**  
Thursday, Nov. 9;  
7:30 - 9:30 p.m.  
Multipurpose Room, East Field House. Cost: $10.   
Contra dance evolved from the elegant European court dances of the 18th century but acquired its rambunctious high-energy as it developed on the American frontier. Spirited traditional fiddle music drives tapping feet and clapping hands as dancers execute figures together, with each move called out by a dance caller, complete with silly patter and rhymes. Bring a partner, or switch around. Wear cool clothing and comfortable shoes. Instructor Andy Wilson first started contra dancing when he was a freshman in college, and was hooked the first night.   

**Hip Hop Dance - Beginning  
**Class 1: Wednesday, Oct. 11 - Nov. 8; 7:30 - 8:30 p.m.  
Class 2: Wednesday, Oct. 11 - Nov. 8; 8:30 - 9:30 p.m.  
Multipurpose Room, East Field House. Cost: $25.  
Ready to get down and boogie? Come one, come all, and let your soul run free with the hippest grooves in Santa Cruz. The class begins with warm-up stretches, then moves on to a dance routine, and then cool down. Hip Hop is a great way to have fun while getting a great work out. The instructor is Marissa Valera.
