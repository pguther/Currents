Particle physicists have developed an amazingly successful theory describing how the universe works on the most fundamental level. This theory, known as the Standard Model and hailed as one of the greatest intellectual achievements of the 20th century, is still only understood and appreciated by a limited number of people who tend to have advanced science degrees. Physicist Bruce Schumm hopes to change that with his new book, _Deep Down Things: The Breathtaking Beauty of Particle Physics. _  
  
Schumm, a professor of physics at UCSC, said he was determined to make his book accessible to any interested reader without watering down the science. In _Deep Down Things,_ he takes the reader on a fascinating journey into the bizarre, subatomic world of particle physics.   
  
The path at times requires close attention, but Schumm is a witty and eloquent guide, offering patient explanations and helpful analogies, as well as candid acknowledgment of concepts that remain mysterious even to scientists.
