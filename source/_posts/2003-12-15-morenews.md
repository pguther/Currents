UC receives $400,000 to expand successful math and science summer school

The University of California has been awarded a $400,000 grant by the Toyota USA Foundation to expand its California State Summer School for Mathematics and Science program (COSMOS) to a fourth UC campus.  

The funding will cover 50 percent of the planning costs to establish a new site, and half of the operating costs of the monthlong summer school's first year of operation.  

The university has yet to determine which of its campuses will host the new summer school program, which is expected to be in place for students in 2005. Last summer, about 450 high-achieving students entering the 9th to 12th grades took part in COSMOS's residential program at UC Irvine, UC Santa Cruz, and UC Davis.
