  United Way will be spreading the word about its programs and asking for help from the campus community during its annual campaign, beginning October 23.
</p>
<p>
  Faye Crosby, Academic Senate chair, and Kitty Woldow, Staff Advisory Board chair, have sent a letter to faculty and staff encouraging them to support the campus campaign. The two wrote that Santa Cruz County's United Way funded 33 agency programs last year--"touching the lives of half the residents in Santa Cruz County."
</p>
<p>
  Psychology professor Martin Chemers, a member of the United Way board of directors, is also involved in the campaign.
</p>
<p>
  "I have served both on the fundraising side, covering the educational institutions in our county, and on the allocation side, evaluating proposals for grant funds to support programs in our targeted areas of strong families, youth, homeless, disabled and elders," said Chemers. "I have come to realize that when disaster strikes in an area, whether a hurricane in Louisiana or an earthquake in Santa Cruz, the quality of the community support infrastructure becomes a critical component for recovery."
</p>
<p>
  Chemers said the management efficiency of the Santa Cruz county organization chapter has been evaluated by both the larger United Way organization and by independent philanthropy groups such as the Charity Navigator.
</p>
<p>
  Supporters may choose a monthly payroll deduction (with donations beginning the pay period of January 2007) or enclose a check for a one-time donation. New this year is a redesigned pledge form that all contributing employees must fill out on an annual basis.
</p>
<p>
  The campaign ends on November 3. Completed pledge forms should be sent to Liz Evanovich, Chancellor's Office, by November 17.
