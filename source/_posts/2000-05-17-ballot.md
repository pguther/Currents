The following letter was distributed to members of UCSC's Academic Senate today (May 17, 2000) by Roger Anderson, senate chair:

Dear Colleagues:  
  
Last week, after receiving inquiries from Senators regarding the exact language of the legislation as amended and passed at the 23 Feb 2000 Senate meeting; the accuracy of the unapproved minutes; and the legitimacy of the legislation included with the mail ballot on grading, Secretary David Koo requested a ruling on the validity of the mail ballot from the Committee on Rules, Jurisdiction, and Election (RJ&E). Counting of ballots is pending until a written ruling from RJ&E is issued.  
  
Roger Anderson, Chair  
Academic Senate, Santa Cruz Division
