Ten faculty members and 12 graduate students have received Excellence in Teaching Awards for 2002-03.  

Winners of the awards, for those who have demonstrated exemplary and inspiring teaching, were selected by the UCSC Academic Senate Committee on Teaching.   

Nominations for the annual honor are submitted by students, and the committee also reads a statement on teaching written by the nominee, as well as a letter from the department chair. The committee looks for evidence that the nominee has thought deeply about teaching and learning, and effectively applies that thinking in the classroom.  

This year's awards were presented by Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood and Committee on Teaching Chair Judith Habicht-Mauche on May 23 at University House. Their names were also announced during the final Academic Senate meeting of the 2002-03 academic year, on May 16.  

The winners, with the text on their certificates, are:
