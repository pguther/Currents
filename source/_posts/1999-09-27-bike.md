  Beat the traffic blues and the high price of gasoline by riding your bicycle to campus on Thursday, October 7, the first-ever Bike to Work/School Day to be held in the fall in Santa Cruz County.<br>
</p><br>
Bike to Work/School Day has been an annual event in the spring since 1988. The new Bike to Work/School Day takes place during the annual California Rideshare Week, October 4-8. Organizers are expecting both events to continue annually.<br>
<br>
As during the spring event, cyclists can enjoy a free breakfast from 6:30 to 9:30 a.m. on October 7 at sites throughout the county. One of the sites is located at the UCSC Student Center at The Bike Co-op, where Beckmann's muffins, Noah's Bagels, Martinelli juice, Jamba Juice, and Peet's coffee will be on the menu.<br>
<br>
The sites also feature free bike fixes, commuter massages, and the opportunity for cyclists to win one of three prizes: a trip around the world, a Patagonia all-weather cycling jacket, or a $50 gift certificate from Bugaboo Mountain Sports.<br>
<br>
In addition to UCSC, other breakfast locations include: the Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium, The Buttery, and Java Junction at the Gateway Shopping Plaza in Santa Cruz; Simpkins Family Swim Center in Live Oak; Cabrillo College in Aptos; Le Boulanger in Scotts Valley; and Nook Cafe in Watsonville. New Leaf Community Markets in Capitola, Felton, and Westside Santa Cruz also offer breakfast locations (in Santa Cruz the site is also sponsored by Beckmann's Bakery).<br>
<br>
Bike to Work is sponsored by The Spokesman Bicycles, Monterey Bay Unified Air Pollution Control District, Santa Cruz County Regional Transportation Commission, and many other businesses and organizations in Santa Cruz County, including UCSC's Transportation and Parking Services.<br>
<br>
