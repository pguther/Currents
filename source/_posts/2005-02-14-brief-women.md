On Wednesday, February 16, planning for the 19th annual Women at Work Retreat continues with a meeting from noon to 1 p.m. in the Bay Tree Conference Center, Room C. For those who can't attend during the lunch hour, there will be a repeat meeting at 5 p.m. at the Women's Center.

This year's retreat will be held on April 21 and 22 at the St. Francis Retreat in San Juan Bautista. The theme for the event is "Adapting to Change: Juggling Tradition and Innovation."

Several key committees are in need of volunteers, including hospitality and entertainment. New ideas and energy are welcome. Even if you can't come to meetings, there are lots of ways to help. Contact Sabrina Shaver at [sabrina@soe.ucsc.edu][1].

Future planning meetings will be held on
