  <font color="#003399">Benefits update for Health Net subscribers</font>
</h4>
<p>
  Ongoing contract negotiations between Health Net and Sutter Health/Santa Cruz Medical Clinic could potentially affect between 900 and 1,000 current and retired UCSC employees. Negotiations were not concluded by the end of Open Enrollment on November 22, and the current contract expires on January 31. But the UCSC Benefits Office and the UC Office of the President have made special arrangements so affected employees will not be left without coverage with their chosen physicians, even if a new contract is not negotiated.<br>
  <br>
  Should the contract between Sutter Health/Santa Cruz Medical Clinic and Health Net be terminated, Health Net members enrolled with the Santa Cruz Medical Clinic will be provided with a special enrollment period to choose another health plan.<br>
  <br>
  Health Net members who are enrolled with the Santa Cruz Medical Clinic and wish to remain in Health Net do not need to take any special action. If a special enrollment period is necessary, details will be published in a future issue of <i>Benefits Update,</i> and eligible Health Net members (those enrolled with Santa Cruz Medical Clinic) will receive a notice at their home address. Watch future issues of <i>Benefits Update</i> for additional information.

  <i><br></i></b>First Night has become the New Year's Eve thing to do for residents of Santa Cruz County.

  <br>
  For a three- to four-hour commitment, all volunteers receive a blinking-light admission button. There are special rewards for volunteers who work after 9 p.m. on December 31. Volunteers who contribute more hours, such as site managers and set-up/clean-up crews, also receive a "Friends of First Night" sweatshirt and are invited to a thank-you party in the new year. Just like the regular admission button, the volunteer button can be used for free bus transportation to and from downtown Santa Cruz on December 31. For more information or to volunteer, call (831) 425-7277 .
