  Children ages 7-11 are invited to spend spring break on the UCSC Farm, where the Life Lab Science Program offers a jam-packed week of fun activities, including gardening, cooking, and crafts.
</p>
<p>
  Campers will prepare food fresh from the farm, sow seeds for home gardens, make compost, and plant seedlings in the Life Lab Garden Classroom. Each day has a theme, including "Plants Day," "Habitat Day," and "Dirt Day."
</p>
<p>
  The camp takes place April 9-13 from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. Cost is $230; a sibling discount is available. Registration forms are available for download at <a href="http://www.lifelab.org">www.lifelab.org</a> (click on "Summer Camp" and scroll down to Registration Information), or call (831) 459-4035 for more information.
