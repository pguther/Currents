Children ages 7-11 are invited to spend spring break on the UCSC Farm, where the Life Lab Science Program offers a jam-packed week of fun activities, including gardening, cooking, and crafts.

Campers will prepare food fresh from the farm, sow seeds for home gardens, make compost, and plant seedlings in the Life Lab Garden Classroom. Each day has a theme, including "Plants Day," "Habitat Day," and "Dirt Day."

The camp takes place April 9-13 from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. Cost is $230; a sibling discount is available. Registration forms are available for download at [www.lifelab.org][1] (click on "Summer Camp" and scroll down to Registration Information), or call (831) 459-4035 for more information.
