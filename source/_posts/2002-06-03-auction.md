  The Friends of Long Marine Lab will hold a "Whale of an Auction," the group's popular annual fundraiser, on Friday, June 14. The event will take place in the Porter College Dining Hall, starting at 6 p.m.
</p>A social and gastronomic occasion as well as an auction, the evening includes a full dinner buffet, champagne and caviar tasting, cheese and salmon tables, wine, and music. The event raises funds to support Long Marine Laboratory's public education programs.<br>
<br>
Tickets for the evening are $50 for members, $60 for nonmembers (if purchased by June 7), and $65 at the door. Sponsored tables of 10 are $800. To purchase tickets, please contact Teri Sigler at (831) 459-5828.<br>

Auctioneer Karen Cogswell will lead the silent and live auction. Many exciting and unique items will be up for bid, including field trips with researchers, a Santa Cruz Wineries winetasting with limousine ride, a clambake for 20 on the beach at the Crow's Nest, a children's birthday party at the Seymour Center, trips to exotic locales, art, and jewelry. Surfing lessons, wetsuits, surf boards, and an electric bike are also among the items to be auctioned.<br>
