  <a name="group" id="group"></a>Systemwide staff group to meet at UCSC<br>
</p>
<p>
  UCSC will host a three-day meeting of UC Staff Assemblies (CUCSA), the UC systemwide staff organization, beginning on February 10.
</p>
<p>
  Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood will welcome CUCSA members when they arrive; Paul Schwartz, communications director for human resources and labor relations in the UC Office of the President, will address the gathering; UC Regents Alfredo Terrazas and John G. Davies are scheduled to attend, as well as Student Regent-designate Matthew Murray.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Agenda items include an update on the state budget and its impact on the university and a report on a CUCSA discussion with Regent Ward Connerly to establish a staff representative to the UC Board of Regents.<br>
</p>
<p>
  CUCSA is an advisory body made up of staff delegates from each of the nine UC campuses, Los Alamos National Laboratory, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and the Office of the President. CUCSA meets on a quarterly basis, rotating among campuses, to discuss issues of importance to staff and to provide feedback to the Office of the President on these issues.<br>
</p>
<p>
  UCSC representatives to the council are Staff Advisory Board (SAB) members Patt Takeuchi, financial planning analyst, and Ed Titus, campus telecommunications manager. To reach the SAB, send e-mail to Titus at <a href="mailto:etitus@ucsc.edu">etitus@ucsc.edu</a>.<br>
