  <font size="5"><b>This year's campus maps available at bookstore</b></font><br>
  <br>
  The 2001 editions of the UCSC campus map have arrived at Bay Tree Bookstore, and are available for purchase.<br>
  <br>
  The four-color poster version fits in a standard poster frame, and costs $8.95. A business envelope-size folded version includes directions, a parking map, and locator maps of various off-campus sites; it is available for $2. (Campus units using a recharge receive a 10 percent discount on both maps.)<br>
  <br>
  The UC Santa Cruz Parking Map is a new map for 2001-02 and is available through Printing Services, (831) 459-2925. This two-sided map is 11" x 17" and can be purchased individually (10 cents each) or in pads of 100 ($11.50). It is a black-and-white map, with parking lots shown in yellow. The index on the reverse side provides a key to building locations, a numerical list of parking lots, and the permits required for each.<br>
  <br>
  All of these new map products will be revised annually. In addition, a searchable web version of the campus map will soon be available online. The map web site will include downloadable versions of various campus and college maps.
