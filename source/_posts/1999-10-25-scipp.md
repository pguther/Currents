The Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics (SCIPP) will present a physics workshop for high school teachers on Saturday, November 13. The workshop, which is free and open to all teachers, will take place from 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. in Room 101, Natural Sciences Annex, on the UCSC campus. The workshop will give teachers a new perspective on modern physics and help them develop an up-to-date curriculum for high school physics. It will feature science presentations by UCSC physics faculty, a report on SCIPP's 1999 Research Experience for Teachers program, and an interactive session on advancing the physics curriculum. The workshop is hosted by SCIPP in collaboration with teachers Kelly Clark from Georgiana Bruce Kirby Preparatory School in Santa Cruz and Stuart Brice from Independence High School in San Jose. Talks by leading theorists and experimental researchers in physics will cover a range of topics. Presentations will include:

* Professor Michael Dine, "Elementary Particle Physics"
* Professor Joel Primack, "Cosmology"
* Professor David Dorfan, "Phenomena and Discoveries"
* Adjunct Professor Hartmut Sadrozinski, "Experiments and Observations"

For information and to make reservations to attend the workshop, contact Jacqueline Pizzuti at (831) 459-4499 or [jackie@scipp.ucsc.edu][1]. Additional information is available on [SCIPP's Web site][2].
