<p>
  The Staff Forum/Brown Bag planned for Wednesday, February 23, has been postponed.
</p>
<p>
  This is due to a necessary change in Chancellor Denton's schedule, which requires her to be out of town. When a new date is set, it will be announced through <i>Currents Online</i> and the campus e-mail tree.
</p>
<p>
  Brown-bag forums are cosponsored by the Chancellor's Office and the Staff Advisory Board.
