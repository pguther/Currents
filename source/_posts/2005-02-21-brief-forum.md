The Staff Forum/Brown Bag planned for Wednesday, February 23, has been postponed.

This is due to a necessary change in Chancellor Denton's schedule, which requires her to be out of town. When a new date is set, it will be announced through _Currents Online_ and the campus e-mail tree.

Brown-bag forums are cosponsored by the Chancellor's Office and the Staff Advisory Board.
