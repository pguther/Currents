**Piero Madau   
**Professor of Astronomy and Astrophysics  
  
Piero Madau's research interests include the formation of the earliest cosmological structures in the universe and the formation and evolution of galaxies. He explores early epochs in the history of the universe by studying high-redshift (very distant) regions of the universe, star formation in distant galaxies, the intergalactic medium, and the background radiation that permeates the universe. Madau received his B.Sc. in physics from the University of Florence and his Ph.D. in astrophysics from the International School for Advanced Studies in Trieste. Before joining the UCSC faculty, he was assistant director of research at Cambridge University's Insitute of Astronomy.
