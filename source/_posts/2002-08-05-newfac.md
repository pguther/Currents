New Faculty

**Holger Schmidt**  
Assistant Professor of Electrical Engineering

Holger Schmidt studies the fundamental physics of optical interactions between light and matter, with applications in the development of novel electronic and photonic devices. His research interests include time-resolved laser spectroscopy of semiconductors and nanostructures; all-optical semiconductor devices; nonlinear optics; and quantum optics. Schmidt earned a diploma in physics from the University of Stuttgart, Germany, and M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in electrical and computer engineering from UC Santa Barbara. Before joining the UCSC faculty, he was a postdoctoral fellow in the semiconductor laser group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Since his arrival at UCSC in 2001, Schmidt has received a prestigious NSF CAREER Award (a five-year grant from the National Science Foundation).
