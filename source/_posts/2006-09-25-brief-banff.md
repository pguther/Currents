Faster, steeper, higher, deeper: The Banff Mountain Film Festival Radical Reels tour is coming to Santa Cruz September 30 at 7 p.m. at the Rio Theatre.

Catch the steepest and deepest in high-adrenaline outdoor sport films. Hurtle down steep untouched powder, feel the cold spray of stomach-dropping kayak first descents, fly high with the world's wildest BASE jumpers, and much more in mountain biking, climbing, and snowboarding.

Growing out of the famous Banff Mountain Film Festival World Tour, Radical Reels screens the best in action sports filmmaking, audience-tested and programmed for maximum excitement.

Radical Reels is hosted by UC Santa Cruz Recreation and sponsored by Seagate, Clif Bar, Good Times, and Pacific Edge Climbing Gym. Tickets are $8/students & seniors, $10/general in advance.
