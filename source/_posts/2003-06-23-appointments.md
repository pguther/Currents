Appointments

Mickey Aluffi named new UCSC police chief

UCSC Police Captain Mickey Aluffi will become UCSC's new police chief on July 1, replacing Jan Tepper, who is retiring. Aluffi, who has been with the UCSC department for three and a half years, worked for the Santa Cruz County Sheriff's Office for 13 years and was a Watsonville police lieutenant and captain for 17 years before coming to UCSC.   

Comparing police work at UCSC with other police agencies, Aluffi said he likes the opportunity for one-on-one contact between police and the campus community. "I think that's something most police agencies aim for, and we've got it here," he said. Coming to UCSC "was kind of like a return home," Aluffi said, adding that he was born and raised on the west side of Santa Cruz.  

When Aluffi takes over as chief, Sergeant Robert Jones will move up to captain. Jones has been with UCSC since 1990, with a yearlong stint at UC Santa Barbara.  

The department is getting some new faces this summer. Sergeant Mark Larson is coming from the UC Santa Barbara police force, and Officer Linda Robinson is a recent police academy graduate. The resident police position at Mount Hamilton will be filled by Mark McDonald, who has about 13 years' experience with the San Anselmo Police Department.  

In addition to Tepper's departure, the department is losing two other veterans to retirement: Sergeant Nancy Carroll, who has been with the UCSC police department since 1983, and Bill Gehri, police officer for Mount Hamilton for the past 33 years.
