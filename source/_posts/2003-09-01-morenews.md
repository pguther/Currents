  <a name="farm" id="farm"></a>Farm's Fall Plant Sale Sept. 12-13 boosts year-round gardening
</p>
<p>
  Get a jump on fall gardening by visiting the UCSC Fall Plant Sale on Friday and Saturday, September 12 and 13, in the Barn Theater parking lot. Hours are noon to 6 p.m. on Friday and 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Saturday.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The annual sale offers gardeners a rich selection of certified organic vegetable seedlings, perennials, and California natives.
</p>
<p>
  Sponsored by the UC Santa Cruz Farm &amp; Garden at the Center for Agroecology &amp; Sustainable Food Systems, the sale benefits the UCSC Farm &amp; Garden Apprenticeship, a six-month training course in organic farming and gardening.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Lettuce, salad mix, Swiss chard, Asian greens, and Brassicas like broccoli, cabbage, and kale are just a few of the vegetables that can be planted this fall for winter harvest. Flowers like bachelor buttons, statice, and stock can also be planted in the fall for late winter and spring blooms.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Autumn is the best time to plant perennial shrubs and California natives because the soil is still warm, which helps transplants establish strong roots. The plants will be all set for vigorous growth as the days get longer in the spring.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Members of the Friends of the UCSC Farm &amp; Garden receive a 10 percent discount on purchases; memberships will be available at the sale. For more information about the Fall Plant Sale or the Friends of the Farm &amp; Garden, call (831) 459-3240 or send e-mail to jonitann@ucsc.edu.<br>
