Students voted to increase their transportation fees and establish a new intramural and sports club team activities fee in balloting May 17 through May 23. Proposals on renewable energy, recreation programs, and Seymour Marine Discovery Center also passed.

A modification to the student voice and empowerment fee language failed, as did a UCSC athletics measure, and a graduate student government fee increase. (See earlier [_Currents_ article][1])

The fees must be approved by President Dynes before they become official.

Student Union Assembly officers were also elected. Complete results will be posted online at [elections.ucsc.edu/][2] once the SUA releases the tallies.
