Come out for a day of erosion control work and general trail maintenance on the Seep Zone Interpretive Trail in upper campus on Saturday, October 16, from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.

Enjoy a day of working outside, learn about native plant and animal communities of the UCSC campus, and contribute to the protection and enhancement of the UCSC Natural Reserves.

Meet at the Communications Building patio (next to Baskin Engineering) at 10 a.m (please arrive on time). Bring water, lunch (snacks and juice will be provided), layered clothing, warm jacket, boots or sturdy shoes (no open-toed shoes please), hat, and sunscreen. Only hard rain cancels. Come prepared to get dirty.

A second work day is scheduled for Sunday, November 14.

For more information or to sign up, contact the natural reserve steward at [mcstay@ucsc.edu][1] For more information about the stewardship program, visit the [Natural Reserves][2] web site.
