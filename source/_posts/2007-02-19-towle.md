  Crown College marine biology student Mike Towle was watching the sunset with his girlfriend November 14 when a man suddenly fell into the ocean from rocks along West Cliff Drive.
</p>
<p>
  Towle shed his clothes and shoes and scampered down the cliff into the 52-degree water. He got to the man who was being dashed into the rocks by waves and eventually managed to pull him back to shore with a life ring someone had tossed.
</p>
<p>
  Acting Chancellor George Blumenthal honored Towle at his February 14 cabinet meeting, presenting him with a certificate of appreciation and calling his actions "heroic."
</p>
<p>
  Towle, who graduated in December, now lives in Long Beach as he recuperates from a broken wrist suffered during the rescue. It happened, he said, as he and the young man were swept by waves from an offshore rock outcropping.
</p>
<p>
  The man, suffering from hypothermia, recovered after being taken to the hospital.
