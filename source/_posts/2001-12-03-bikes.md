Spurred on by manufacturer rebates, Ecology Action has increased the incentive for an electric bike to up to $500 per bike. Incentives of up to $300 per bike were offered previously. Santa Cruz County area residents can now purchase these battery-powered bikes from as low as $425 to $1,000.

The price includes a one-year service warranty and a rechargeable bike light. Electric scooters and conversion kits for existing bikes are also offered, at a lower price.   
  
The savings are made possible through the Electric Bike Commuter Incentive Program, designed to provide an innovative way for commuters to drive less, therefore reducing traffic and air pollution. This is a unique program that links small local businesses, nonprofit groups, and government, to come up with a solution to a growing community problem.  
  
Funding from the Santa Cruz County Regional Transportation Commission and the Monterey Bay Unified Air Pollution Control District powers this incentive.   
Over 300 electric bikes have been purchased by Santa Cruz County residents through this program, which has been running for just over a year. Electric bikes may be operated either as a peddle bike or a motor-powered bike. Users may get exercise when they want it and use motor power for hills, fast starts, and no-sweat travel. Electric bike riders can literally zip up the otherwise daunting UCSC hill without sweat, pollution, parking fees, or time wasted looking for a parking spot.   
  
To be eligible to participate, riders must be Santa Cruz County residents and attend a free two-hour safety training class. Three brands and 13 models are offered at the following four local retailers as a part of the program:

* Subaru Santa Cruz, 1219 Soquel Ave., Santa Cruz (near the top of Seabright Avenue), 420-1500.
* Cycle Works, 1203 41st Ave., Capitola (across from Spa Fitness), 476-7092
* Electric Sierra Cycles, 302 Pacific Ave., Santa Cruz (near the Santa Cruz Wharf), 425-1593
* CycleSport, 245J Mt. Hermon Rd. (in the Safeway Shopping Center), Scotts Valley, 440-9070.
