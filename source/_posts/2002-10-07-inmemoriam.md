<p class="sectionhead">
  Norman O. Brown
</p>
<p>
  Norman O. Brown, professor emeritus of humanities and author of <i>Life Against Death</i> and <i>Love's Body,</i> died October 2 at his residence in Santa Cruz. He was 89.
</p>
<p>
  Brown's influential scholarship and teaching encompassed the classics, theology, history, psychology, sociology, and literature, among other disciplines. "He was a liberating, visionary scholar, the successor in the 20th century to Blake and to Nietzsche," said Jerome Neu, professor of philosophy at UCSC and a longtime colleague of Brown.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Brown taught a variety of courses, mostly through the History of Consciousness Department, until his retirement in 1981. His last two books were <i>Closing Time</i> (1973), and <i>Apocalypse and/or Metamorphosis</i> (1991), a collection of essays he had written over the course of 30 years.
</p>
<p>
  A celebration of the life of Norman O. Brown will take place on Saturday, October 19, at 3 p.m. in a location to be determined; when a location is determined, it will be posted on this web page.<br>
