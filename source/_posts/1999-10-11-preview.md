Preview Day at UC Santa Cruz--held each fall for prospective students, their parents, and counselors--will take place on campus on Saturday, October 16, from 9 A.M. to 3:30 P.M.

The day's activities will include student-led campus tours of UCSC's eight residential colleges and workshops on financial aid, Educational Opportunity Programs, and the transfer program. Representatives from the campus's academic departments will also be on hand to provide information and answer questions.

A complimentary breakfast will be available in the morning, and lunch will be available for purchase. Live music will also be provided in the morning during the Academic Advising and Student Life Fairs.

Reservations for Preview Day are not necessary. Visitors should arrive at the main campus entrance (Bay and High Streets) the morning of the 16th and follow signs to parking.

For more information about Preview Day activities, contact UCSC's Office of Admissions at (831) 459-4008 or go to the Preview Day [web site][1].
