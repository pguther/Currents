_  
UCSC's Academic Senate will hold its winter meeting at 2:30 p.m. Wednesday, March 8, at Kresge Town Hall. Faye Crosby, Academic Senate Chair, has addressed the following letter to members of the Senate outlining issues on the agenda. _  
  
Dear Colleagues,  
  
Many important matters face us, and we are looking forward to addressing them at the winter meeting of the UC Santa Cruz Division of the Academic Senate. The Call for the meeting can be found online at [senate.ucsc.edu/meetings/06mar/A06mar.html][1]

Issues concerning admissions, undergraduate education, graduate education, and the well-being of faculty and staff will all benefit from close attention by all members of the Academic Senate as will some "housekeeping" matters.  
  
My colleagues on the Senate Executive Committee and I urge you to read the Call carefully and to come express your opinions at our meeting on March 8 at 2:30, Kresge Town Hall.
