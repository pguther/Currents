The UCSC Fire Department is presenting two Community Emergency Response Team (CERT) courses this fall for faculty and staff. The courses will be held September 18-21 and October 16-19. All sessions will be from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m.

The 20-hour class provides both classroom and skills training in basic emergency response topics, such as fire safety, light search and rescue, team organization, and disaster medical operations. Each participant will receive a backpack containing essential emergency response items. The cost is $75.

The Community Emergency Response Team concept was developed and implemented by the Los Angeles City Fire Department in 1985. Since 1993, the Federal Emergency Management Agency has made CERT training available in communities in 28 states and Puerto Rico. For more information on the CERT program, go to [www.citizencorps.gov/cert/][1]  
  
This program is a vital component of the campus's emergency response capabilities, and all campus divisions are expected to participate.
