<p>
  As part of her ongoing effort to keep in touch with students, staff and faculty, Chancellor Denice D. Denton has launched a series of brief audio messages to the UCSC community.
</p>
<p>
  In her first message, which is now available both as a streaming audio file or as a downloadable podcast, Denton comments on recent progress in achieving one of the key campus priorities she announced in November. Denton calls the priority, Invest in People, the most important of the six priorities she laid out in her inaugural address.
</p>
<p>
  More audio messages will follow, providing updates on campus achievements, Denton said.
</p>
<p>
  The audio medium allows members of the campus community to listen at their convenience, either using their computer or by downloading the message to a portable MP3 player, such as Apple Computer's iPod, for later listening.
</p>
<p>
  Podcasting technology transfers audio files to a computer for listening at a time of one's choosing. To begin, you must have podcasting software installed on your computer.
</p>
<p>
  Links and instructions on downloading podcasting software are available at <a href="http://podcasts.ucsc.edu/">podcasts.ucsc.edu</a>. The most recent chancellor's message can also be found at the same site for immediate listening.
