Controlled burn on Wilder/Gray Whale Ranch

A proposed burn of an area of Wilder Ranch State Park is scheduled for June 10. The date is tentative, as changes in burning conditions can happen on a daily basis. The burn will be approximately 20 acres and may be proximate to UCSC-owned property. The UCSC Fire Department will be present at the burn site with a standby engine for the duration of the burn. Smoke should not migrate onto the campus. Smoke columns and the smell of smoke may be noticed, depending on weather conditions.  
  
If you have any questions, contact Mike Phinn, assistant chief, UCSC Fire Department, (831) 459-2344_
