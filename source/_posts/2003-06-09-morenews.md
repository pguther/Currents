  <a name="burn" id="burn"></a>Controlled burn on Wilder/Gray Whale Ranch
</p>
<p>
  A proposed burn of an area of Wilder Ranch State Park is scheduled for June 10. The date is tentative, as changes in burning conditions can happen on a daily basis. The burn will be approximately 20 acres and may be proximate to UCSC-owned property. The UCSC Fire Department will be present at the burn site with a standby engine for the duration of the burn. Smoke should not migrate onto the campus. Smoke columns and the smell of smoke may be noticed, depending on weather conditions.<br>
  <br>
  If you have any questions, contact Mike Phinn, assistant chief, UCSC Fire Department, (831) 459-2344<i><br></i><a href="#burn"><i>back to top</i></a>
