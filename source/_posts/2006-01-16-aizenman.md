Professor of economics Joshua Aizenman is coeditor of the new book _Managing Economic Volatility and Crises: A Practitioner's Guide_ (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005).

The book addresses two critical policy issues: how to deal with macroeconomic volatility and how to manage financial crises.   
Aizenman and coeditor Brian Pinto, under the auspices of the World Bank, reviewed and edited papers presented at bank-sponsored seminars and a conference devoted to the topic.

Aimed at development-policy practitioners, the book is a user-friendly presentation of empirical and policy results. The book examines the impact of volatility on growth and poverty, commodity price volatility, the roles of the financial sector as an absorber and amplifier of volatility and shocks, and the management and prevention of macroeconomic crises. It includes a cross-country study, case studies on Argentina and Russia, as well as lessons from the debt default episodes of the 1980s and 1990s.

Contributors are affiliated with institutions that include Harvard University, Georgetown University, the Ministry of Finance of The Russian Federation, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank.
