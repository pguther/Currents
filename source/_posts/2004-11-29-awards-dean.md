Carolyn Dean, professor of history of art and visual culture, has been honored with the Latin American History Conference Prize for 2004. She received the award for her article, "Hybridity and Its Discontents: Considering Visual Culture in Colonial Spanish America" which was published last year in _Colonial Latin American Review._ The prize is awarded by the Conference for Latin American History (CLAH/AHA) for the best article on Latin American history published during the previous year.

Currently on sabbatical this year, Dean served for the past three years as chair of the History of Art and Visual Culture Department. Her area of research specialization is Pre-Columbian and Colonial Latin American Visual Culture with a focus on Inca art and culture, both before and after the Spanish invasion of Peru. Dean teaches courses on the visual cultures of Pre-Hispanic Mesoamerica and the Andes, as well as a variety of topics relevant to indigenous American and colonial Latin American studies.
