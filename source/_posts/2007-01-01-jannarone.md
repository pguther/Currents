  Assistant professor of theater arts Kimberly Jannarone has been awarded the 2005 Gerald Kahan Scholar's Prize by the American Society for Theatre Research for her essay, "The Theater Before Its Double: Artaud Directs in the Alfred Jarry Theater." The prize was presented at the American Society for Theatre Research Conference in Chicago in November.
</p>
<p>
  Jannarone's essay, published in <i>Theatre Survey</i> (November 2006), is an archival analysis of the directing work of Antonin Artaud, a figure of the French interwar avant-garde known primarily for his theoretical writings. Jannarone is currently in Paris on a special research grant finishing her book manuscript "Artaud and His Doubles."
