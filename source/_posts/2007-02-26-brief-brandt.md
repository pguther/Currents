  Last year, the Theater Arts Department welcomed Kirsten Brandt--an award-winning director, producer, and playwright---as a new lecturer in drama. Brandt now makes her UCSC directing debut with a lively multimedia production of Bertolt Brecht's parable <i>The Good Person of Setzuan,</i> currently playing through Sunday, March 4, in the Theater Arts Mainstage.
</p>
<p>
  Presented in a new adaptation by playwright Tony Kushner, <i>The Good Person of Setzuan</i> focuses on the failings of society and asks whether it is possible for a person to be good in a capitalistic society. Kushner, one of the most prominent contemporary playwrights in America, is known for the political themes of his works and for his landmark <i>Angels in America - Part One: Millennium Approaches</i>.
</p>
<p>
  Brandt is joined by numerous faculty and student colleagues in mounting this production, which includes original choreography by assistant professor of drama Patty Gallagher; scenic design by assistant professor of design David Lee Cuthbert with student Robyn James; costume design by assistant professor of design Brandin Baron with student Tanya Finkelstein; lighting design by David Lee Cuthbert with student Kelly Kunaniec; sound design by student Ben Jaffe; plus original music by San Diego-based Ruff Yeager.
</p>
<p>
  Brandt was artistic director of San Diego's nationally recognized cutting-edge company Sledgehammer Theatre for six years. She studied directing at the University of California, San Diego, and playwriting at the University of Birmingham, England.
