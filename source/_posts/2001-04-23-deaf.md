Deaf Awareness Week at UCSC will offer a glimpse into the world of the deaf through stage and film, a crash course in sign language, and presentations on the Americans with Disabilities Act. All events are free.  

  
"The Disability Resource Center is sponsoring Deaf Awareness Week [May 1-4] in hopes of opening the door for hearing people to enjoy a taste of deaf culture and gain a positive understanding of deafness," said Karen Keen, program services coordinator for the center.  
  
Missy Keast, a deaf professional storyteller and actress who has toured with the National Theatre of the Deaf, will give a one-woman performance at 8 p.m. Thursday, May 3, at Stevenson College Dining Hall.

She has also compiled _One Day: Our View,_ a book to be published this spring. Deaf culture is documented in the book through history and photography. Keast's show will be in sign language with voice interpreting for the "hearing inclined."  
  
The documentary _In the Land of the Deaf, _by French filmmaker Nicolas Philbert, will be shown at 8 p.m. Wednesday, May 2, in Stevenson College Dining Hall.

The film, in French with French sign language and English subtitles, was called "an engrossing eye-opening experience" by the _New York Times._  
  
Those who have always wanted to learn sign language may want to attend the workshop by Sarah Beauchamp, a deaf student at UCSC. The workshop is from 2 to 4 p.m. on Friday, May 4, at the Cowell College Fireside Lounge.   
  
Legal issues surrounding the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) will be addressed at an [all-day workshop][1] Tuesday, May 1, with a keynote speech by nationally known attorney and writer Salome Heyward.   
  
For more information, call the Disability Resource Center, (831) 459-5635 for voice or (831) 459-4806 for those hard of hearing, deaf, and/or speech impaired.
