### Benefits Office announces Health Care Facilitator Program

The Benefits Office is now providing services to campus employees through the Health Care Facilitator (HCF) Program. Funded by UC HR/Benefits, the HCF Program is designed to augment the information, education, intervention, and referral services that the campus Benefits Office provides.

The HCF program provides assistance to UC employees, annuitants, and/or their family members who are enrolled in any of the UC-sponsored medical plans and who are in an unusual or difficult medical situation. These situations could include access difficulties, need for coordination of health care services, disputes over plan coverage, or getting leads on community services.  
  
Frank Trueba has been hired as the health care facilitator, and he has been receiving specialized training to familiarize him with campus contacts and the ins and outs of UC's health care system, including all of the various medical, dental, and vision plans.   
  
For assistance from the Health Care Facilitator Program, contact the Benefits Office at (831) 459-2013. Additional information on the program can be found in the current issue of the campus [_Benefits Update_][1] newsletter.
