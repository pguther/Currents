These situations could include access difficulties, need for coordination of health care services, disputes over plan coverage, or getting leads on community services.<br>
  <br>
  Frank Trueba has been hired as the health care facilitator, and he has been receiving specialized training to familiarize him with</font> <font color="#000000">campus contacts and the ins and outs of UC's health care system, including all of the various medical, dental, and vision plans.<br>

  <a name="Luna" id="Luna"></a><font color="#003399"><b>James Luna performs with the Rez Band Novem</b></font>
</h3><font color="#003399"><b>ber 8</b></font>
<p>
  James Luna will perform with the Rez Band on Thursday, November 8, at 8 p.m. in the Porter Dining Hall. Luna, a Native American artist, uses performance and installation to educate audiences about multiculturalism and how it affects all people. In these media, he makes connections to contemporary Indian lifestyles and traditions of ceremony, dance, and storytelling. By connecting Indian culture to the outside world through his art, Luna focuses on difficult subjects that directly affect his community--alcohol and drug abuse, crime, lack of education, unemployment, and loss of cultural identity. Admission is free with a UCSC student, faculty, or staff ID; general admission is $5. For more information, call (831) 459-5667.<br>
  <b><br></b>In addition to this performance, James Luna will also be on campus for a four-day residency, which will include workshops and in-class art critiques.
