Nauenberg worked with Richard H. Dalitz of Oxford University to edit the book, which presents new developments and insights in Newtonian scholarship for students and scholars interested in the history and philosophy of science.<br>
  <br>
  Newtonian scholarship has taken great steps forward in the last half-century. The recent completion of critical editions of Newton's mathematical papers and of his scientific correspondence, as well as the publication of the first volume of his optical papers and of variant readings of the <i>Principia</i> in the original Latin, have made most of Newton's scientific work generally available for study and analysis for the first time. This has provided a better understanding of Newton's <i>Principia</i> and <i>Optics,</i> especially regarding their origin and interpretation, much of which has remained obscure for several centuries.<br>
  <br>
  The new book includes papers by several of the scholars who have made these primary sources accessible and by others who are using them to elucidate Newton's work. Most of the papers included were presented at the <i>Symposium on the Foundations of Newtonian Scholarship,</i> organized by Nauenberg and Dalitz and held at the Royal Society of London in March 1997.

  Currently Professor Nauenberg is working on a proposal to initiate a program in history of science and technology on our campus. For details see <a href="http://mike.ucsc.edu/~michael/">http://mike.ucsc.edu/~michael/</a>.<br>
