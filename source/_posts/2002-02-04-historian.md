Noted historian Lawrence Goodwyn will give a free public talk about democracy in America on Wednesday, February 6, from noon to 1:30 p.m. in the College Eight Red Room at UCSC.

During his talk, entitled "Reorganizing Democracy in America," Goodwyn will outline his vision of what's needed to create a movement to reconstruct democracy in the United States.

Goodwyn will draw on examples from the civil rights movement and other popular social movements. Discussion will follow his formal remarks.

Goodwyn is a professor of history at Duke University. He specializes in comparative social movements, populism, and the American South. He teaches courses on social theory, the insurgent South, the Civil War, populism, and race, gender, and class.

The founder of the Duke Oral History Program, Goodwyn is the author of several highly acclaimed books, including _Democratic Promise: The Populist Movement in America_, which was nominated for a National Book Award, _Breaking the Barrier: The Rise of Solidarity in Poland_, and _Texas Oil, American Dreams: A Study of the Texas Independent Producers and Royalty Owners Association_. Goodwyn is currently working on a manuscript exploring the origins and outcomes of the American Revolution.

Goodwyn's talk is part of a weeklong visit to UCSC. It is being cosponsored by the UCSC Departments of Community Studies, American Studies, History of Consciousness, Sociology, and Politics, as well as College Eight, Merrill College, the UCSC Center for Justice, Tolerance, and Community, and the Center for Cultural Studies. During his visit, Goodwyn will also attend undergraduate seminars, meet with graduate students, and hold discussions with local community organizers.
