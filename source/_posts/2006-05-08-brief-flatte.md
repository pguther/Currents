The Department of Physics has organized a colloquium in honor of Stanley Flatte, professor emeritus of physics, on Thursday, May 11. The event will take place from 4 to 6 p.m. in Thimann Lecture Hall 1.

The colloquium will provide a retrospective of Flatte's long and varied career, with speakers from a range of fields in which he has made significant contributions. Speakers will include Abraham Seiden, director of the Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics, who will discuss Flatte's contributions to particle physics, and Thorne Lay, professor of Earth sciences, who will discuss his seismology contributions. Two speakers will address Flatte's work in ocean acoustics--Jeff Simmen, director of the Applied Physics Laboratory at the University of Washington, and John Colosi, an oceanographer at the Naval Postgraduate School. Other speakers will be Serban Protopopescu of Brookhaven National Laboratory and Rod Frehlich of the University of Colorado.

Flatte is a fellow of the American Physical Society, the Acoustical Society of America, the Optical Society of America, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He earned his B.S. in physics from the California Institute of Technology and his Ph.D. in physics from UC Berkeley. He joined the UCSC faculty in 1971.
