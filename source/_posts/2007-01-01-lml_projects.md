Albatrosses, harbor seals, steelhead trout, and leopard sharks are among the subjects of the 11 student research projects that will be supported this year by the Friends of Long Marine Lab Student Research and Education Awards. The awards will provide a total of $9,512 in research funding for the student projects, which were selected by a proposal review committee.

The award recipients will be recognized at a special ceremony and reception at the Seymour Marine Discovery Center on Thursday, January 25. In addition, the Friends of Long Marine Lab will honor the top two student research award recipients--Caren Barcelo, a graduate student in ecology and evolutionary biology, and Brett Walker, a graduate student in ocean sciences--with a special award to be presented at the annual Global Oceans Gourmet Dinner on April 14 at Chaminade.

The Friends of LML provides funding for public education, marine mammal programs, and student research, as well as the development and operation of the Seymour Center. The Student Research and Education Awards come from the interest generated by five different endowments: the Jane McHenry Student Awards Fund, the Lillian McPherson Rouse Student Award Fund, the Friends of LML Student Support Fund, the Mark T. MacMillan Memorial Prize Fund, and the Ken Norris Marine Mammal Research Award.
