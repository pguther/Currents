  Those looking for a place to relax and have a bite to eat in Quarry Plaza will be in luck starting Thursday, October 17, when a temporary food service will begin operation at the restaurant in the Graduate Commons.
</p>
<p>
  Rock 'n' Java will offer sandwiches, salads, pastries, desserts, and a coffee bar while the search continues for a permanent vendor to replace the Whole Earth, which closed in the summer because of financial difficulties.
</p>
<p>
  Rock 'n' Java will be open from 7:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. on Monday through Thursday, and from 7:30 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. on Friday. No weekend service is planned at this time.
</p>
<p>
  The Graduate Student Commons Governance Board is accepting bid proposals postmarked through October 31. The restaurant is part of the Graduate Commons, and the Commons relies on the food service provider for a large portion of the debt payment for the building, which was completed in the summer of 2001.
</p>
<p>
  The board received several requests for bid information from potential vendors before it even began placing newspaper advertisements, said Diane Brookes, facilities manager for the Graduate Commons. Brookes said the quality and variety of potential vendors so far has been impressive.
</p>
<p>
  Once all the bids are received, a search committee made up of students, staff, and faculty will review the proposals and narrow the list down to several finalists. The committee will then visit each potential vendor's restaurant and review financial data.
</p>
<p>
  In a statement this summer, the board said it is seeking vendors "consistent with the campus expectations and culture." Financial stability is another factor the board cited. It wants a vendor who is now operating a single dining service facility with an annual gross sales volume of at least $300,000. The board is hoping to have a permanent vendor operating the restaurant in January or February.
</p>
<p>
  Potential vendors seeking bid information should e-mail <a href="mailto:dbrookes@cats.ucsc.edu">Brookes</a> or call her at (831) 459-1395.
</p>
