  The annual holiday food drive to benefit Second Harvest Food Bank will continue through December 18.
</p>
<p>
  "The need for services has dramatically increased by 20 percent this year," wrote Academic Senate Chair Faye Crosby and Staff Advisory Board Chair Kitty Woldrow in a letter urging the campus community to contribute to the drive.
</p>
<p>
  The letter included an envelope for donations, which may be sent via Campus Mail. For every dollar donated, Second Harvest is able to distribute more than $9 worth of food. A $10 donation provides a family of four with an average of 50 meals.
</p>
<p>
  Those wishing to have food donation bags dropped off should call (831) 459-4852. Food may be dropped off at campus mail stops and a mail truck will be at base of campus December 1 to make it even easier to drop off bags of food.
</p>
<p>
  The campus goal is 25 tons of food and cash equivalent donations, which will go toward the communitywide goal of 1.2 million pounds.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="http://www.thefoodbank.org">Second Harvest</a> supports a network of approximately 160 human service agencies and programs that serve more than 45,000 people every month, almost half of them children.<br>
