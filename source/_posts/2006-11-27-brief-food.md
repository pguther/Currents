The annual holiday food drive to benefit Second Harvest Food Bank will continue through December 18.

"The need for services has dramatically increased by 20 percent this year," wrote Academic Senate Chair Faye Crosby and Staff Advisory Board Chair Kitty Woldrow in a letter urging the campus community to contribute to the drive.

The letter included an envelope for donations, which may be sent via Campus Mail. For every dollar donated, Second Harvest is able to distribute more than $9 worth of food. A $10 donation provides a family of four with an average of 50 meals.

Those wishing to have food donation bags dropped off should call (831) 459-4852. Food may be dropped off at campus mail stops and a mail truck will be at base of campus December 1 to make it even easier to drop off bags of food.

The campus goal is 25 tons of food and cash equivalent donations, which will go toward the communitywide goal of 1.2 million pounds.

[Second Harvest][1] supports a network of approximately 160 human service agencies and programs that serve more than 45,000 people every month, almost half of them children.
