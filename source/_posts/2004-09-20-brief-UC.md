The Office of Scholarly Communication at the University of California has announced new services that provide greater access to UC scholarship.

Using the new seminar series feature of the [eScholarship Repository][1], UC faculty can publish seminar papers and give their seminars, lecture series, and colloquia a lasting and highly visible presence on the Internet.  
  
Additional information is available at the UC Office of the President web site, at <http://www.ucop.edu/news/archives/2004/sep14a.htm>
