<p>
  The Office of Scholarly Communication at the University of California has announced new services that provide greater access to UC scholarship.
</p>
<p>
  Using the new seminar series feature of the <a href="http://repositories.cdlib.org/escholarship/">eScholarship Repository</a>, UC faculty can publish seminar papers and give their seminars, lecture series, and colloquia a lasting and highly visible presence on the Internet.<br>
  <br>
  Additional information is available at the UC Office of the President web site, at <a href="http://www.ucop.edu/news/archives/2004/sep14a.htm">http://www.ucop.edu/news/archives/2004/sep14a.htm</a>
