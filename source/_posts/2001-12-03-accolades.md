#### **Steven Vogt**

Steven Vogt, professor of astronomy and astrophysics, was presented with the California Community College Distinguished Alumni Award for 2001 at the Community College League of California's Riverside convention on November 17. At the presentation, Vogt described how his interest in science and math was kindled while attending Diablo Valley College in 1967. He found his first astronomy class so interesting that he became a student aide for the instructor, Bob Searles. Vogt said he also discovered that he could be successful at math and even enjoyed it.   
  
Vogt is known for his work as a member of the world's most successful team of planet hunters. Astronomers have discovered more than 70 planets orbiting distant stars, and more than 40 of them have been discovered by Vogt's team using advanced spectrometers that he designed.  
  
"Steve Vogt is personally responsible for the greatest haul of planets that we humans have snagged from the rest of the universe," said Geoffrey Marcy of UC Berkeley, who was one of Vogt's first graduate students at UCSC. "He designs unique spectrometers. There are no textbooks, no existing blueprints, and no optical gurus that he can fall back on."

#### Ivelisse Rivera-Bonilla

Ivelisse Rivera-Bonilla, a doctoral candidate in cultural anthropology, has been named the recipient of the 2001-02 American Anthropology Association Minority Dissertation Fellowship. Rivera-Bonilla's dissertation, "Gated Communities: Residential Segregation and Fear of Crime in Puerto Rico During the 1990s," analyzes how sealing off residential areas re-creates spatial markers of class and racial differentiation. It is based on fieldwork she conducted from 1988 to 2000 and on her own experience as a longtime resident. The fellowship is awarded each year to an outstanding doctoral student.
