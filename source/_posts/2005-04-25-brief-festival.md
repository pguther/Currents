The 2005 Pacific Rim Music Festival--a nine-day international celebration presented by the UCSC Music Department--kicks off on the afternoon of Friday, April 29.

The festivities will begin with a parade and outdoor performance in downtown Santa Cruz by the Korean Folk Percussion Ensemble (Samulnori), a group of 20 performers from Korea. The ensemble will be met at the UCSC campus by percussion ensembles from the Bay Area, as the procession makes its way to the university's arts complex to unite with the UCSC Gamelan Ensembles

Later that evening, San Francisco's Ensemble Parallele will be joined by guest mezzo-soprano Mutsumi Hatano, pipa (lute) virtuoso Wu Man, and violinist Young-Nam Kim for an opening concert, titled _Hun Qiao_ (Bridge of Souls) _Remembrance, Reconciliation and Peace_\--a program created in response to modern wartime atrocities.

Other festival highlights include a celebration of composer Terry Riley's 70th birthday featuring the Kronos Quartet and tabla virtuoso Zakir Hussain at the Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium; and an evening with the Berkeley Symphony conducted by internationally renowned conductor (and UCSC alumnus) Kent Nagano at the Music Center Recital Hall with guest performance by Japan's celebrated pianist Aki Takahashi.
