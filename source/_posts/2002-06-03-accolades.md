### Undergraduates honored at Student Awards Ceremony

By [Ann M. Gibb][1]

Santa Cruz Mayor Christopher Krohn opened the Student Awards Ceremony by officially proclaiming May 31, 2002, as "UCSC Student Achievement Day." Undergraduate winners of campus, state, and national awards, their families, and faculty mentors were hosted by Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood at the annual event, held on the grounds of University House. The ceremony capped a week of events highlighting undergraduate achievements in research and the performing, visual, and literary arts.

Awards announced included the UCSC Deans' and Chancellor's Awards, which recognize outstanding achievements by undergraduate students within an academic division (Arts, Engineering, Humanities, Natural Sciences, Social Sciences). Ten Deans' Awards are granted within each division. Of those students, up to three in each division are selected to receive a Chancellor's Award. These winners and other campus and national awardees are listed below.  
  
**Steck Award  
**Endowed by UCSC alumnus Loren Steck and his family, this award honors the finest senior thesis completed during an academic year. The award, which includes a $1,000 prize, is open to all academic divisions, and the winner is chosen from the Chancellor's Award candidates. (Recipient: Blake Johnson)   
  
**Donald A. Strauss Scholarship  
**The Strauss Foundation awards scholarships to students from selected four-year California colleges and universities, who have demonstrated an interest in public service, have outstanding leadership potential, and are in the upper one-third of their class. (Recipient: Morvarid Ebrahimi)
