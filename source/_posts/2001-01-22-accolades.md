  A recent graduate of UCSC's doctoral program in international economics has won a prestigious economics research award for her work on international capital markets.

  Sujata Verma, who earned her Ph.D. last June, will receive the EXIM Bank International Economics Research Annual Award (IERA) 2000 from the Export Import Bank of India for her dissertation, "The Architecture of the International Capital Markets: Theory and Evidence." The award is presented annually to an Indian national who has submitted a dissertation on international trade and finance and has earned a doctorate in the past four years.

  Verma, a part-time faculty member at San Jose State University, will receive a citation and 50,000 rupees, equivalent to about $1,100. If she is unable to accept the award in person, her father will accept it on her behalf at a ceremony in Mumbai, India, in March.<br>
