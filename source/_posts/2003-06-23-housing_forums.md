Those looking for housing on campus may want to mark their calendars for several key dates in July.

The new Housing Access Policy--which includes staff members and non-Senate academics as well as faculty members--will be discussed at campus forums on July 1, 3, and 8.   

And July 11 is the deadline for eligible staff and non-Senate academics to apply for selection in the housing lottery.   

Under the new Housing Access Policy, which applies to units managed by the Faculty and Staff Rental Program:  

* A fixed allocation of available for-sale and rental units will be distributed to Academic Senate faculty (80 percent), non-Senate academics (5 percent), and staff (15 percent).  
* An employee must be 100 percent time with a minimum of a one-year appointment to be eligible to participate.
* Persons who have been employed by the university for more than two years will not be eligible for the rental apartments.   

Rental applications may be [downloaded][1] and faxed to (831) 458-1937 or mailed to Faculty Housing Office, Hagar Court Community Room, Santa Cruz, CA 95064.  

Specifics on for-sale and rental opportunities will be provided during informational sessions at the Women's Center on these dates:  

* Tuesday, July 1, 3-5 p.m.
* Thursday, July 3, 12:15-1:30 p.m.
* Tuesday, July 8, 12:15-1:30 p.m.

Those planning to attend are asked to RSVP to Faculty Housing by [e-mail][2] or by calling (831) 458-3506.  

**Lottery to be held on July 15**  

All eligible employees interested in the for-sale program should [e-mail][2] Faculty Housing and ask to be placed on a waiting list for the for-sale program.  

Due to anticipated high demand, a lottery will be held to select 50 current staff and 15 current non-Senate academics for placement on their respective waiting lists. After this lottery, only newly hired employees will be eligible to participate in the for-sale program.  

The onetime lottery will be held on Tuesday, July 15, at Merrill Dining Hall from noon to 1:30 p.m. All applicants are encouraged to attend. Applications must be submitted by 5 p.m. on July 11 to be considered for the lottery.

Additional information on the housing policy is available [online][3].
