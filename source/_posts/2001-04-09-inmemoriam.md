**Joseph P. Allen**, the longtime head of admissions at UCSC before he took a similar position at the University of Southern California, died of a cerebral hemorrhage, April 4, in New York City. He was 53.

Before leaving the campus in 1993, Mr. Allen had served UCSC in a variety of positions for more than two decades. He came to UCSC in 1972 as student activities coordinator for Porter College, started the Gateway Project in 1976, became director of admissions in 1985, and dean of admissions in 1988.

Please see obituaries on Mr. Allen published by the [University of Southern California][1] and the [L.A. Times][2]. A [tribute][3] was also written by a student for the _USC Daily Trojan, _and a [message][4] was sent to the UCSC community.__

**Michael Crocker**, a recently appointed member of the the UC Santa Cruz Foundation, died March 30 in an automobile accident; he was 60 years old. He was a businessman who lived most of his life in South America before moving to Santa Cruz two years ago. Mr. Crocker is survived by his wife, Cecilia Goez Crocker, and four children.
