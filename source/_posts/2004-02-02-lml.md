Fourteen undergraduate and graduate students in the marine sciences received valuable support and recognition for their research projects this year from the Friends of Long Marine Lab Student Research Awards.

The awards will provide a total of $9,400 in research funding for the student projects, which were selected by a proposal review committee.   

The award recipients were recognized last week at a special ceremony and reception held at the Seymour Marine Discovery Center.   

Also this year, for the first time, the Friends of Long Marine Lab will honor the top two student research award recipients--graduate students Morgan Bond and Veronica Vigilant--with a special award to be presented at the Global Oceans Gourmet Dinner, a fundraising event for the Friends of LML that will take place in March at the Bittersweet Bistro.  

Bond is studying the growth and survival of steelhead trout on the central California coast. His advisers are Mark Carr, associate professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, and Bruce MacFarlane, a researcher with the National Marine Fisheries Service.   

Vigilant is studying domoic acid, a neurotoxin produced by certain marine algae, and how it affects marine life in Monterey Bay. Her adviser is professor of ocean sciences Mary Silver.  

The Friends of LML provides funding for public education, marine mammal programs, and student research, as well as the development and operation of the Seymour Center. The Student Research Awards come from the interest generated by six different endowments: The Jane McHenry Student Awards Fund, the Lillian McPherson Rouse Student Award Fund, the William Baye Heald Scholarship Fund, the Friends of LML Student Support Fund, the Mark T. MacMillan Memorial Prize Fund, and the Ken Norris Marine Mammal Research Award.
