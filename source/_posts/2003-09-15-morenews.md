Long Marine Lab celebrates 25th anniversary with special lecture series

![][1]Long Marine Laboratory turns 25 this fall, and the oceanside research facility will be celebrating its silver anniversary with a variety of public programs, tours, and lectures during the first 25 days in October. Highlighting the October celebration is a stellar lineup of speakers for the lab's annual fall lecture series.   

Talks begin at 7 p.m. at the [Seymour Marine Discovery Center.][2] Admission is $5 for members, $8 for the general public. Seating is limited, so advance purchase is recommended. Tickets can be purchased at the center or by phone at (831) 459-3800.  

In addition, there will be special exhibits and commemorative activities throughout the month at the lab's Seymour Marine Discovery Center.

[**Fall Lecture Series][3]**   

**October 2:** Leon Panetta, director of the Leon and Sylvia Panetta Institute for Public Policy at Cal State Monterey Bay, and Julie Packard, executive director of the Monterey Bay Aquarium and a UCSC alumna. Both of these local luminaries served on the Pew Oceans Commission and will share their perspectives on ocean health and policy.   

**October 9:** Brian Walton, coordinator of the Santa Cruz Predatory Bird Research Group, and Burney Le Boeuf, professor emeritus of ecology and evolutionary biology at UCSC, will share results and insights from two decades of research on peregrine falcons and elephant seals, respectively. They will be joined by Kathryn Sullivan, president and CEO of the Center of Science and Industry and a UCSC alumna, who will share her perspectives as an astronaut, oceanographer, and educator.   

**October 16:** Sandy Lydon, professor emeritus of history at Cabrillo College, and Gary Griggs, professor of Earth sciences and director of UCSC's Institute of Marine Sciences. This presentation, "Long Marine Lab and Monterey Bay: From the Cretaceous to the Coastal Commission," will review the geological and historical past and possible futures of the region.  

Computer researchers meet with industry reps to discuss data storage systems

UCSC faculty and students in the [Storage Systems Research Center][4] (SSRC) met with computer industry representatives last week to exchange ideas on the future of data storage. The SSRC is focused on improving the performance, security, and reliability of data storage systems.   

Attending the SSRC Retreat were industry sponsors of the center's research, including Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Intel, Microsoft, OnStor, Overland Storage, and Veritas. Industry sponsors provide about $250,000 a year in support of SSRC research. The center also receives major funding from the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy. Researchers from Lawrence Livermore and Los Alamos National Laboratories also attended the meeting.   

"The retreat is an opportunity for us to present our research and get feedback from industry sponsors. We want to know what they think the most interesting problems are for us to work on," said SSRC director Darrell Long, a professor of computer science in the Baskin School of Engineering.  

The SSRC includes eight faculty members and more than 20 graduate students working on a range of projects involving storage system architecture, real-time systems, security, data mining, performance evaluation, and reliability.
