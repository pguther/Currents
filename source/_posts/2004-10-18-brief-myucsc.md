UCSC officially launched its new campuswide "enterprise" web portal last week when all students began accessing their academic information via the [my.ucsc.edu][1] web site. Last Thursday's cutover from the former "student portal" affected continuing students; faculty and new students began to access the new portal in July.  

'MyUCSC,' using the PeopleSoft software the campus purchased in 2002, is the sign-on point for students and faculty to use "secure AIS self-service for activities such as registration and student records, student billing and account information, and financial aid information," said Academic Information Systems director Mark Cianca. "Over time, MyUCSC will grow to include self-service from other campus systems."  

A link to the new site has been added to the UCSC home page.
