<p>
  Over the years, civil rights attorney Connie Rice has tackled incendiary social problems, from urban police misconduct to inequitable patterns of school construction in Los Angeles.
</p>
<p>
  Along the way, she has won widespread acclaim for her work expanding opportunity and advancing multiracial democracy.
</p>
<p>
  On April 20, Rice will deliver a free public lecture titled "Pushing for Justice, Collaborating for Change: Educational Equity and the Future of California."
</p>
<p>
  The event is the seventh annual spring lecture sponsored by the UCSC Center for Justice, Tolerance, and Community. It will take place from 7 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. in Holy Cross Hall, 170 High Street, in Santa Cruz.
</p>
<p>
  Named one of California's top 10 most influential lawyers, Rice is codirector of the Advancement Project in Los Angeles, which promotes opportunity and inclusion by combining litigation with consensus-based problem solving and intergroup collaboration.
</p>
<p>
  A graduate of Harvard University, Rice earned her law degree from New York University School of Law. As a litigator with the NAACP Legal Defense Fund in Los Angeles, Rice filed a landmark case on behalf of low-income bus riders that resulted in a mandate that more than $1 billion be spent to improve the bus system. In 1999, she launched a coalition lawsuit that won $750 million for new school construction in Los Angeles--money previously slated for less crowded, more affluent suburban school districts. Rice has led multiracial coalitions of lawyers and clients to win more than $4 billion worth of relief and damages.
</p>
<p>
  The <i>Los Angeles Times</i> designated her one of 24 leaders considered "the most experienced, civic-minded and thoughtful people on the subject of Los Angeles."
</p>
<p>
  Rice is frequently interviewed by local and national media, having appeared on <i>60 Minutes</i>, <i>The News Hour with Jim Lehrer</i>, <i>Nightline</i>, <i>The Oprah Winfrey Show</i>, and dozens of cable, network, web, and radio programs.
</p>
<p>
  "Connie Rice has both challenged the system and worked within it to make major changes in policies and practices," said Manuel Pastor, codirector of CJTC and a professor of Latin American and Latino studies at UCSC. "She is at the forefront of efforts to build new and more effective coalitions for justice. She is truly a role model for social activism in the 21st century."
