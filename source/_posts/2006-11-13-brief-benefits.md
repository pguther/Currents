You've got a few days left--until November 21--to make Open Enrollment changes. Go to the [UC Open Enrollment web site][1] and decide whether you want to make any changes for 2007 in your health and welfare benefit plan enrollments.

General information and the 2007 monthly premium rates for UC medical plans are available at the Open Enrollment web site, where you also can review your personal benefits summary, find out about plan benefits and services changes for 2007, use special tools to help you decide if you should make enrollment changes, and make and confirm changes.

You may wish to consider enrolling or re-enrolling for 2007 in the UC [ Health Care Reimbursement Account][2] (HCRA) program. The HCRA account allows you to use pre-tax dollars to pay qualified health care expenses while reducing your tax liability. New this year is a convenient spending account card to pay your expenses. For details, go online to the Open Enrollment web site HCRA section.

For other ways to save on taxes, see the UC Benefits article ["Need More Cash? Use UC Benefits to Save on Taxes."][3]
