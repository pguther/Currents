Physicist and author **Michael Riordan** has an opinion piece in the December issue of the _Harvard Business Review_ about how innovation flourished at AT&T before the company was broken up. Riordan also published an article in _IEEE Spectrum_ on "How Europe Missed the Transistor," about a second invention of the transistor in Paris that eventually fizzled out commercially.

Physicist **Robert Johnson** was quoted in a story in the _Aptos Times_ about his team's work on the GLAST space telescope project. The _Aptos Times_ also ran a story about engineers **J. J. Garcia-Luna-Aceves** and **Darrell Long**, who were both named Fellows of the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers.

_Metro Santa Cruz_ ran a story on _COSMOGONIE INTIME_, a newly published, limited-edition, collaborative book of art on exhibit at **McHenry Library's Special Collections**, featuring French poet Yves Peyre, visual artist Ray Rice, and award-winning book artist and UCSC alumna **Felicia Rice**.
