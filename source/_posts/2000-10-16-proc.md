By Mayor's Proclamation, October 10 was declared to be "UC Santa Cruz Students, Faculty, and Staff Day" in the city of Santa Cruz.

The proclamation, given to Chancellor Greenwood at the City Council meeting that night, recognizes the "dedication and valuable contributions" UCSC's students and employees make to the community.  
  
The proclamation made particular note of a recent survey that determined that UCSC students, faculty, and staff performed approximately 895,000 hours of community service during summer 1998 and the 1998-99 academic year.

According to the proclamation, that is the equivalent of work that would be done by 429 full-time employees in the community.
