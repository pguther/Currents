For the first time since 1972, UC Santa Cruz is pleased to announce the founding of a new college. College Nine will serve as the intellectual home of students interested in global and international studies, the first of whom will enroll in fall 2000.

"Like the campus's other eight colleges, College Nine will integrate living and learning environments by bringing together students with shared interests," said UCSC Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood. "Students affiliated with the college during its first years will have the opportunity to work with faculty and staff to develop the college's theme of global studies and to shape the academic direction of the college."  
  
Unlike its predecessors, College Nine will operate under the general oversight of an academic division rather than the dean of undergraduate education. The Division of Social Sciences, with its focus on the study of interpersonal relationships and human society, was the natural academic umbrella for the college, said Greenwood. As dean of Social Sciences, Martin Chemers has been closely involved with the establishment of College Nine.  
  
"College Nine's affiliation with the division will strengthen the academic themes of global studies, including economics, ethics, and cultural diversity," said Chemers. "We want to encourage undergraduate research, interdisciplinary studies, and experiential learning through academic field programs and internships. Residential and co-curricular programs will reflect the college's intellectual themes, as well."   
  
Deana Slater was recently named college administrative officer of College Nine. She is charged with overseeing the student affairs functions of the college, including co-curricular and academic programming, administration, and residential life. A search is currently under way for an associate dean of the college, who will report to Chemers while fulfilling the responsibilities of college provost.   
  
Construction of apartments that will accommodate 280 continuing and transfer students is under way and is expected to be completed this fall; residence halls that will house 400 students are slated to open in fall 2001. Final plans include the building of residence halls for 400 students affiliated with College Ten and a dining hall that will serve both colleges, said Slater.  
  
Located in a redwood grove next to Social Sciences 1 and 2, College Nine is the first college to open at UCSC since College Eight was established in 1972. A nature reserve behind the college provides immediate access to hiking and running trails.  
  
College Ten will emphasize the theme of social justice and equity. Together, up to 3,000 students will be affiliated with Colleges Nine and Ten when they are completed.  
  
Cowell College was the first to open its doors on the campus in 1965, followed by Stevenson, Crown, Merrill, Porter, Kresge, Oakes, and College Eight. The campus's first seven colleges have been named for major donors; Colleges Eight, Nine, and Ten are available for renaming in honor of major campus contributors. All undergraduates and most faculty are affiliated with one of the colleges, which are committed to fostering a nurturing and academically thriving environment for students of all backgrounds. Each self-contained college is home to 40 to 90 faculty members and between 1,100 and 1,400 students, about half of whom live on campus. The colleges have their own academic emphases and cultural traditions, and they play a primary role in academic advising and are the center of student life.
