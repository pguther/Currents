  Due to declining ridership and increasing operating expenses, Transportation and Parking Services (TAPS) is canceling Jitney service between UCSC and UC Berkeley. Friday, June 30, will be the last day the service is offered, said Wes Scott, TAPS director.
</p>
<p>
  Although no direct transit services are available between Santa Cruz and Berkeley, a few passenger transportation options remain, Scott said. (TAPS has compiled two options, available at <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/taps/ucscucb.html">www2.ucsc.edu/taps/ucscucb.html</a>. Also, Fleet Services offers rental pool vehicles for campus affiliates; for more information on vehicle rentals, contact Fleet Services at (831) 459-2228 or check the Fleet Services web site (<a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/fleets/">www2.ucsc.edu/fleets/</a>).
