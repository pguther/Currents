### KZSC extends antenna tower as part of plan to increase station signal

Helicopter crews, working in the remote area of the campus behind the Crown-Merrill Apartments on Wednesday, extended the height of the antenna tower used by KZSC Radio. The work was done as part of a project that will enable KZSC to increase its broadcasting wattage.

"This project will result in our listeners in Santa Cruz, Monterey, and San Benito Counties receiving a clearer signal from the station," said Marlene Olson, director of student media.

The tower was extended 40 feet, to a new height of 140 feet. When a new transmitter comes on line sometime this summer or early in the fall, station wattage will increase from 1,250 to 10,000 watts, Olson said.

### City installs new 'contraflow' bike lane on High Street

Santa Cruz city workers were busy late last week installing a "contraflow" bike lane on High Street between Storey Street and Highland Avenue. The route is popular among bicyclists riding to and from campus. But the ride home on that section of High has been illegal because it was against traffic.

The lane--the first of its kind in Santa Cruz--was approved by the City Council on a six-month trial basis. With the specially marked lane in place, eastbound bicyclists are able to travel against the one-way westbound flow of motor traffic, said Cheryl Schmitt, the city's bicycle/pedestrian coordinator.

"To make this project a success and advocate for its continuation," it is important that users abide by the following rules: stop at Storey Street before proceeding eastbound in the contraflow bike lane, be aware that motorists may cross the contraflow bike lane to park on the south side of the street, stop at the new stop at Highland Avenue, yield to all pedestrians in crosswalks, and walk their bikes on the pedestrian bridge over Highway 1.

### Gyuto Monks bring sacred music of Tibet to campus

[Arts & Lectures][2] will present the Gyuto Monks in concert on Wednesday and Thursday, March 27 and 28, at 8 p.m. in the UCSC Theater Arts Mainstage.

The monks of Gyuto have perfected a special type of chant in which each monk sings not a single note but an entire chord, generating a sound of ethereal beauty that shakes listeners to their very core.

After experiencing the unearthly multiphonic chanting of the Gyuto Monks in 1987, Grateful Dead percussionist Mickey Hart resolved to make their unique music available to a wider audience. The resulting sold-out tours and acclaimed CDs (including the soundtracks to the films _Kundun_ and _Seven Years in Tibet_) have given the world a rare glimpse of the spiritual practices of Tantric Tibetan Buddhism, much as they occur within the walls of Gyuto Monastery. "Without any question, [the Gyuto Monks] represent the spirit and culture of Tibet at its highest level," says composer Philip Glass, an enthusiastic past collaborator.

For tickets or more information, call the Ticket Office Tuesday-Friday from noon to 6 p.m. and Saturday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. at (831) 459-2159.

### New short-term parking spaces now available in Core West Parking Structure

Guests, visitors, and others in search of short-term parking in the Science Hill area now have 19 new parking spaces for their use on the second level of the Core West Parking Structure. These spaces are available for up to two hours.

When you park in any of the 19 designated "stall" spaces, note your space number, and then visit the pay station located by the elevator at the Steinhart pedestrian entrance. Payment can be made with coin, cash, or your MasterCard or Visa credit card. Once payment is made there is no need to return to your vehicle to place a validation on your dash; the pay station records your payment electronically. The pay station also makes change for $5, $10, and $20 bills.

Departments located near the Core West Parking Structure will want to be sure to inform potential guests and visitors of this new parking option offered by TAPS. Please note that A and B permit holders need to pay the fee at the pay station to park in these spaces, as is required of permit holders when parking at meters on campus.
