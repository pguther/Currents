In response to the projected dramatic increase in UC enrollments in the coming years, referred to as "Tidal Wave II," the UC Advising Conference 2000 will explore issues and topics related to this challenge. All UC faculty and staff advisers are invited to attend the conference, entitled "Riding the Wave Into the 21st Century."

UCSC will host the annual UC Advising Conference May 18 and 19 at the Monterey Marriott Hotel and Conference Center.

Lynda Goff, vice provost and dean of undergraduate education and professor of biology, will welcome the participants and William Ladusaw, provost of Cowell College and professor of linguistics, will give the opening address. Keynote speakers will be David Anthony, provost of Oakes College and professor of history, and Bettina Aptheker, chair and professor of women's studies.

Advising staff from UCSC's departments, colleges, and Student Affairs Division have been collaborating on presenting the conference, which is expected to draw as many as 230 participants from the eight UC campuses.  
  
Funding has been provided by the UC Office of the President, the Educational Partnership Center, the deans from UCSC's five divisions, and UCSC's dean of undergraduate education.
