  The University Library will present an exhibit of photos by acclaimed American photographer Brett Weston through March 30 in Special Collections.
</p>
<p>
  Photos for the exhibit will be selected from a major donation of over 200 photographs that the campus received last year--valued at more than $1 million-- from Oklahoma collector Christian Keesee and the Brett Weston Archive. (See <a href="http://currents.ucsc.edu/05-06/05-22/weston.asp">Currents story</a>)
</p>
<p>
  The exhibit will also include portraits of the photographer made by his father, Edward Weston. The library's Special Collections photo holdings were initiated at UCSC in the late 1960s with the donation of more than 800 project prints by Edward Weston.
</p>
<p>
  A separate exhibit of Brett Weston photographs will also be on display at University House from February 16 to March 23, after which it will be on loan to the Chancellor's Office in Kerr Hall.
</p>
