  B. Sriram Shastry, professor of physics, has been elected a Fellow of the American Physical Society (APS), a major recognition of professional accomplishment from the leading organization of physicists. Shastry is a theoretical physicist known for his achievements in the area of condensed matter physics. His research interests include strongly correlated matter, high temperature superconductivity, quantum magnetism, and other subjects. The citation from the APS recognizes Shastry for "his seminal contributions to the theory of strongly correlated and quantum-spin systems."

  The UCSC physics faculty now includes 17 APS Fellows (including emeriti and adjunct faculty). Each year, no more than one-half of one percent of the society's membership are recognized by their peers with this honor.
