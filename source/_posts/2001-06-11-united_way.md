Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood hosted a reception Thursday, June 7, at University House for this year's "community leadership" donors, those who contributed between $500 and $10,000 to United Way.
<p>
  Greenwood, a member of the United Way Board of Directors, hosted a number of UC Santa Cruz faculty and staff plus approximately 50 community members at the event.<br>
  <br>
  UC Santa Cruz received a gold award from United Way for its part in the campaign this past year. The campus community contributed more than $77,000 to the Santa Cruz County United Way, the most of any educational organization and second overall to Granite Rock Company.
