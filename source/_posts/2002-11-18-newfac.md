  <span class="sectionhead">Julie Tannenbaum</span><br>
  Assistant Professor of Philosophy
</p>
<p>
  Julie Tannenbaum's research involves the nature of moral action and its relation to moral motivation. She investigates the tensions between Kantian philosophy, which espouses action from duty, and Aristotelian philosophy, which promotes actions arising from love, sympathy, and compassion. Her article "Acting with Feeling from Duty" in <i>Ethical Theory and Moral Practice,</i> vol. 5 (3), 2002, explores the middle ground between these two points of view.<br>
  Tannenbaum received her B.A., M.A., and Ph.D. in philosophy from UCLA.
