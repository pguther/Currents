  UCSC is hosting the fourth annual Rita Walker Golf Scramble to raise funds for women's athletics. The golf tournament is on Friday, April 27, at De Laveaga Golf Course. Registration is taking place now.
</p>
<p>
  The tournament is named for UCSC's Title IX coordinator, Rita Walker, who, for over a decade, has partnered with UCSC and community leadership to assist the Athletic Department in reaching Title IX compliance. UCSC is one of the few universities in the U.S with a completely Title IX-compliant NCAA athletics program
</p>
<p>
  UCSC is the only NCAA Division III school in the UC system. D-III student-athletes receive no financial aid related to their athletic ability, and the athletic department receives no special funding. In order to sustain the high-quality of the program, each year the campus raises additional funds to help scholar-athletes and coaches cover the cost of team uniforms, travel, and equipment.
