  Donna Haraway, professor of history of consciousness, is this year's recipient of the J. D. Bernal Prize, awarded jointly by the Society for Social Studies of Science and the Institute for Scientific Information. The Bernal Prize is awarded annually to an individual judged to have made a distinguished contribution to the field. Haraway received the award in Vienna, Austria, in September. The Bernal Prize is the highest award given by the society, which also honored Haraway with the 1999 Ludwik Fleck Prize, given to the best book in the field, for her book <i>Modest_Witness@Second_Millennium.<br>
  FemaleMan(c)_Meets_OncoMouse(r)</i> (1997, Routledge).
