The raffle was a huge success, earning $2,500 for the play yard fund. The winners of the quilt were Emily and Tom Nawalinski; Emily (second from left) is pictured here with her daughter Janet (left), and her granddaughter Heather, who is holding her new daughter, Lilly. The day after they won the quilt, Tom and Emily met their great-granddaughter for the first time and gave her the quilt.
