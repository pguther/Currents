  The UC Santa Cruz Predatory Bird Research Group has set up a camera to monitor a pair of peregrine falcons nesting on the headquarters building of the Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Company in downtown San Francisco.
</p>
<p>
  The peregrine "nest cam" offers visitors to the group's <a href="http://www.scpbrg.org">web site</a> the chance to watch the nesting peregrines live on the Internet.<br>
</p>
<p>
  PBRG researchers installed a nesting box on the 33rd floor ledge of the PG&amp;E building in 1987 after peregrine falcons were seen perching on the building. Last year, a pair of peregrines nested in the box and produced two offspring, which successfully fledged. The pair is nesting again this year, and have so far laid two eggs.<br>
</p>
<p>
  PG&amp;E is making a $30,000 donation to the PBRG this year. The money will go toward the operating costs for the peregrine nest cam and the web site, and it will also help fund the group's educational outreach program.<br>
