</h4>Elizabeth Irwin, director of Public Affairs, has been selected as one of the "People of the Century" by the Aptos Chamber of Commerce. Irwin is among 23 people, businesses, and organizations so honored for giving their time, money, and energy to make Santa Cruz County a better place to live in the 20th century. The honorees were celebrated at the chamber's 69th annual dinner and auction at Seascape Resort on October 2.

  Before coming to UCSC in 1995, Irwin was assistant dean of Community Education and director of Marketing and Communications at Cabrillo College. She has also served on the board of directors of the Cultural Council of Santa Cruz County, as vice president of the Pajaro Valley Chamber of Commerce, president of the Aptos Chamber of Commerce, and president of the Cabrillo Music Festival. In 1992 the Aptos Chamber of Commerce also chose Irwin as the organization's "Woman of the Year."

  A film by community studies lecturer Geoffrey Dunn was featured last spring in a film series presented by the Guggenheim Museum on the Philippine-American War in 1899. The film, <i>A Dollar a Day, Ten Cents a Dance: A Historic Portrait of Filipino Farm Workers in America</i> (coproduced in 1984 with Mark Schwartz) chronicles the story of Filipino immigrants who came to the U.S. in the 1920s and 30s. The Guggenheim series was titled "Empire and Memory: Repercussions and Evocations of the 1899 Philippine-American War" and featured some two dozen films on the subject, including a 16 mm piece produced in 1899 by Thomas Edison.
