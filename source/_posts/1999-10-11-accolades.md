#### **Geoffrey Dunn**

A film by community studies lecturer Geoffrey Dunn was featured last spring in a film series presented by the Guggenheim Museum on the Philippine-American War in 1899\. The film, _A Dollar a Day, Ten Cents a Dance: A Historic Portrait of Filipino Farm Workers in America _(coproduced in 1984 with Mark Schwartz) chronicles the story of Filipino immigrants who came to the U.S. in the 1920s and 30s. The Guggenheim series was titled "Empire and Memory: Repercussions and Evocations of the 1899 Philippine-American War" and featured some two dozen films on the subject, including a 16 mm piece produced in 1899 by Thomas Edison.
