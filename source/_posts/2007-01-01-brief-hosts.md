UCSC Extension English Language and International Programs is seeking faculty and staff members interested in serving as host families for international students.

Hosts get to know students from all over the world, learning about new cultures and perspectives, and often forming lasting friendships.

Hosts are paid about $800 a month for their service as a host family, and may contact a local homestay coordinator with any questions or issues that arise.

Additional information is available at the [International Student Placement web site][1].
