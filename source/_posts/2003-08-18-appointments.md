  <a name="blumenthal" id="blumenthal"></a>Ruth Harris-Barnett to head Center for Teaching Excellence<br>
</p>
<p>
  Ruth Harris-Barnett has been named director of the Center for Teaching Excellence (CTE) at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Harris-Barnett is currently the center's interim director.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "It is delightful to know that Ruth and I will be able to continue the excellent work she has begun here at the CTE," said Lynda Goff, vice provost and dean of undergraduate education. "Her accomplishments over the past year demonstrated her outstanding abilities, and Ruth's excellent qualifications made her the best candidate for the job."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Harris-Barnett was appointed to the permanent Director's position after a thorough search involving a nationwide pool of applicants. In addition to her recent service as interim director, she has carried out public education projects for nonprofit organizations, and taught at both the University of Washington and Western Washington University. She received her Ph.D. from the University of Washington in 1989.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "Teaching excellence is critical to our success as a university," Harris-Barnett said, "As instructors teach within and beyond the conventional classroom, we must provide resources like the CTE to support all aspects of their work."
