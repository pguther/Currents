<p>
  Of the thousands of students who have attended UCSC over the last 40 years, no one knows how many have stayed in the area to become a part of the culture and community of the Central Coast region. But UCSC's 40th anniversary and this weekend's <a href="http://alumni.ucsc.edu/reunions/index.html">Banana Slug Spring Fair</a> seemed like a good time to put out some feelers and see who's around and what they're up to.
</p>
<p>
  By no means comprehensive, the following is an informal attempt to bring us all up to speed about the ways in which UCSC grads are helping make Santa Cruz the special place it is.
</p>
<p>
  One caveat: For the most part, you won't see the names of UCSC staff, instructors, and faculty. We know you're out there, but the focus this time is off campus.
