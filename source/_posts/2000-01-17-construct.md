In order to inform members of the campus community of construction impacts, _Currents_ is now posting monthly updates on any construction projects that affect transportation and parking. **Interdisciplinary Sciences Building** Construction will start on the Interdisciplinary Sciences Building, a new addition to the eastern end of Natural Sciences 2, in early February and last through fall 2001\. The building will provide over 34,000 square feet for the Environmental Studies, Astronomy and Astrophysics, and Physics Departments. Expect traffic delays on Steinhart Way, the service road to the Science Library, Earth and Marine Sciences, and Natural Sciences 2. The loading dock to Natural Sciences 2 will be closed. Pedestrian paths will be rerouted along the construction site, and the pedestrian bridge to the Cowell Health Center will be closed. **Core West Parking Structure** Construction on the Core West Parking Structure at the intersection of Heller and McLaughlin Drives has already begun and is expected to last until December 2000. The six-story parking structure will provide approximately 500 parking spaces. Beginning in February, many cement trucks will be traveling up Heller Drive and turning onto McLaughlin Drive about once a week. This should usually occur on Thursdays, but may happen on other days, depending on changing construction schedules. Expect traffic delays in the project area. Parking Lots 112 and 113 are closed. In order to compensate for these lost parking spaces, the North Remote Parking Lot is now reserved for cars with A and B parking permits and is no longer available for remote parking permits. New shuttle service between the North Remote Parking Lot and Science Hill is now offered. The Day East Remote Core route serves these areas every 15 minutes between 7:30 a.m. and 6 p.m. weekdays. The Express Night Core route provides drop-off service to the North Remote Lot weeknights after 6 p.m. New maps and schedules are available at the [TAPS][1] Web site. **Bay Tree Bookstore expansion and Graduate Commons** Work will continue on the new Bay Tree Bookstore and Graduate Commons Buildings through summer 2000. There will be occasional traffic delays due to construction vehicles. Expect construction noise in the immediate area. The short section of Hagar Drive between Steinhart Way and McLaughlin Drive continues to be a one-way street. **Web sites that provide additional information** Visit the [Transportation & Parking Services][2] Web site for information on parking, maps of the campus, and alternative transportation. Visit the [Physical Planning & Construction][3] Web site for updates and maps on road closures, other construction impacts, and current and upcoming construction projects.
