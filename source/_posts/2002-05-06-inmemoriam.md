### Thomas Ortiz

Thomas Ortiz, a longtime member of the staff at McHenry Library, died unexpectedly in his sleep May 1; he was 59.  
  
Tom began working at the library in 1979, and eventually became the head of the library's Operations Unit.

"Tom has been so much part of the library . . . He contributed greatly to the smooth operation of every part of the library and to each of our work lives," said Allan Dyson, University Librarian.  
  
Tom's survivors include his wife, Ellen; his daughter, Felicia; his father, Charles; his sister Charlene; and his brother, Charles "Leo" Ortiz, chair of the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department.
