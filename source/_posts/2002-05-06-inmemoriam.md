</h3>Thomas Ortiz, a longtime member of the staff at McHenry Library, died unexpectedly in his sleep May 1; he was 59.<br>
<br>
Tom began working at the library in 1979, and eventually became the head of the library's Operations Unit.
<p>
  "Tom has been so much part of the library . . . He contributed greatly to the smooth operation of every part of the library and to each of our work lives," said Allan Dyson, University Librarian.<br>
  <br>
  Tom's survivors include his wife, Ellen; his daughter, Felicia; his father, Charles; his sister Charlene; and his brother, Charles "Leo" Ortiz, chair of the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology Department.<br>
