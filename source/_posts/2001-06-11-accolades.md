<p>
  The University of California is one of three universities invited to join the 2001 IBM "Best Practice Partners in Student Services." The invitation recognizes the "outstanding efforts" of a UC systemwide team, under the direction of J. Michael Thompson, UCSC's associate vice chancellor of Outreach, Admissions, and Student Academic Services, in creating the innovative web project <a href="http://www.ucgateways.org/">UC Gateways</a> for all the UC campuses.
</p>
<p>
  UC Gateways is an interactive online tool to assist underrepresented middle and high school students with college preparation. The site provides current UC eligibility information, the ability to maintain an extensive academic profile, and access to school-to-career information, activities, and services. Outreach professionals may register students as UC Gateways users and gain access to information on student test scores, course plans, and career interests.
</p>
<p>
  Thompson will be presenting the UC Gateways project at a forum, titled "Models Blending High Touch/High Tech," which will take place at Tufts University the first week of August. The other 2001 IBM partners in student services are the University of Buffalo and James Madison University.
