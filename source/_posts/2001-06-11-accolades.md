#### J. Michael Thompson

The University of California is one of three universities invited to join the 2001 IBM "Best Practice Partners in Student Services." The invitation recognizes the "outstanding efforts" of a UC systemwide team, under the direction of J. Michael Thompson, UCSC's associate vice chancellor of Outreach, Admissions, and Student Academic Services, in creating the innovative web project [UC Gateways][1] for all the UC campuses.

UC Gateways is an interactive online tool to assist underrepresented middle and high school students with college preparation. The site provides current UC eligibility information, the ability to maintain an extensive academic profile, and access to school-to-career information, activities, and services. Outreach professionals may register students as UC Gateways users and gain access to information on student test scores, course plans, and career interests.

Thompson will be presenting the UC Gateways project at a forum, titled "Models Blending High Touch/High Tech," which will take place at Tufts University the first week of August. The other 2001 IBM partners in student services are the University of Buffalo and James Madison University.

#### Jennie Carreon

Jennie Carreon, who just graduated from Kresge College, is one of eight students chosen from applicants from all over the state to be a California Executive Fellow for 2001-02. The fellowship includes a one-year internship in Governor Davis's office and simultaneous enrollment in a graduate program in public policy at California State University, Sacramento. During her four years at UCSC, Carreon, who had a double major in psychology and Latin American and Latino studies, was supported by a continuing scholarship from the [Hispanic College Fund,][2] a private organization that uses corporate and foundation grants to award scholarships to deserving Hispanic students.

#### June Gordon

June Gordon, assistant professor of education, has received praise for her book, _The Color of Teaching._ The book was selected by the American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education (AACTE) as a finalist in its "outstanding book" competition, honored in the category of books related to teacher education.

The selection committee invited Gordon to contribute an article about her work to an upcoming "theme" issue of _The Journal of Teacher Education,_ the major journal of AACTE, which will be published in March 2002. The issue, "Demography and Democracy: Changing Populations and Teacher Education," will feature short articles from the finalists for the AACTE award whose work relates to the theme.
