[United Way][1] contributors have a special opportunity this year to go "above and beyond" in their generosity.

The campuswide United Way campaign, Oct. 18-29, is encouraging donors to pledge an additional amount to United Way this year, and designate it for the Homeless Services Center. The center needs to raise $340,000 more by the end of the year to qualify for Kresge Foundation matching funds and complete its capital campaign.

![][2]Overall, the United Way campaign has a goal of increasing contributions by 10 percent. In the past five years, UCSC employees have contributed more than half a million dollars to the community through United Way.

"Our participation in the United Way campaign is critical to the preservation of the Community Fund," wrote Academic Senate chair Alison Galloway and Staff Advisory Board chair Patt Takeuchi in a letter to the campus community.

Contributors may choose monthly payroll deduction (beginning with the January 2005 pay period) or enclose a check for a onetime donation. Additional information is available online at the [UCSC United Way web site][1] or by contacting Liz Evanovich, at [lize@ucsc.edu][3] and (831) 459-1325.
