A final project in an art class taught by **Nobuho Nagasawa** turned into a memorable _Good Times_ cover June 8. The cover story, about Y2K graduates, was illustrated by an image of five students walking off into a grassy meadow, carrying tool boxes and wearing short-sleeved blue workshirts. The props were part of the students' final project, for which they each designed individual artworks to give to their classmates and Nagasawa. The toolboxes were a gift from Nagasawa. The students pictured were **Peter Hokama, Virgina Kleker, Sean Horchy, Amy Bunker, and Holly Chang Gummelt.**
