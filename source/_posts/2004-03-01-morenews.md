<p>
  Santa Cruz has nurtured a lively community of fine-press printers and bookmakers for more than three decades. A new exhibition, "Fateful Attractions," opening March 5 at the <a href="http://www.sfcb.org/index.php3">San Francisco Center for the Book</a> (300 DeHaro Street), takes visitors back to the beginning of letterpress printing at UCSC, and then moves forward to showcase a wide variety of contemporary bookworks in the local community.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Curated by Gregory Graalfs, the show includes work from UCSC's Cowell Press and the Lime Kiln Press, plus works by accomplished alumni book artists such as Tom Killion, Gary Young, Ruth McGurk, Felicia Rice, and Peter Thomas. The exhibit runs through June 4.

  <a name="sound" id="sound"></a>Sound and performance artist Matt Heckert to give lecture on March 4<br>
</p>
<p>
  San Francisco sound and performance artist <a href="http://www.mattheckert.com/">Matt Heckert</a> will give a lecture titled "Activating the Medium" on Thursday, March 4, at 7 p.m. in the Media Theater. The lecture will be preceded by a performance by the student group Anti-Tact in the Baskin Sculpture Studios from 6 to 7 p.m. The events are free and open to the public.<br>
  <br>
  During the 1980s, Heckert was one of a trio of artists who developed Survival Research Laboratories, creating remote and radio-controlled robots and designing soundtracks. In 1989 he began working on the "Mechanical Sound Orchestra," a group of computer-controlled mechanical sound instruments. His captivating sound performances are as much happenings as music--the sound you hear is "performed" by the instruments themselves.
</p>
<p>
  Over the past several years Heckert's "Mechanical Sound Orchestra" has traveled throughout the U.S. and Europe including the Sonambiente Festival (Berlin) and the Whitney Museum of American Art (New York). He is a recipient of numerous awards including the WESTAF/NEA Sculpture Fellowship (1991) and the Prix Arts Electronica (1997).
