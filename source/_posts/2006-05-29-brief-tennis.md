Slug tennis did it again. The duo of junior Matt Seeberger and senior Shane Templeman won the NCAA Division III doubles championship May 22 at Mary Washington University in Fredricksburg, Virginia.

The two beat Emory University 6-1 and 6-1 in the semifinals and Middlebury College 6-4 and 6-1 in the championship game.

The UCSC men's tennis team is coached by Bob Hansen, who founded the program 25 years ago.
