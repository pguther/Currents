Shakespeare Santa Cruz will bring its summer audiences tales of love, magic, and tragedy as it celebrates its 20th anniversary season

The summer festival selections are Shakespeare's _Macbeth_ and_ A Midsummer Night's Dream _and Anglo-Irish author Oliver Goldsmith's_ She Stoops to Conquer.  
  
_"Our 20th anniversary season is about the imaginative integration between dark and light, evil and good, the conscious and the unconscious, mind and imagination, passion and reason that theater makes possible," artistic director Paul Whitworth said in a letter to festival subscribers.  
  
The festival begins July 11 with preview performances, with all three plays open and running in repertory July 26 through September 2. For a schedule, see the [Festival Calendar][1].  
  
_Macbeth,_ the story of ambition and murder set in 11th-century Scotland, will be directed by Michael Edwards, a familiar name to festival regulars. Edwards, artistic director of Shakespeare Santa Cruz for seven years and now associate director, directed _Othello_ for the festival in 2000. _Macbeth_ will be appear on the Theater Arts Mainstage.  
  
_Macbeth_ is "one of drama's most powerful explorations of the darker forces of the human mind," said Whitworth. "Shakespeare's shortest and most intense tragedy, Macbeth contains some of the most thrilling dramatic poetry ever written. What power is it that tempts us, with a clear knowledge of the consequences, to choose evil over good?"  
  
_A Midsummer Night's Dream,_ a play in which much of the action takes place in the woods, is especially well-suited to the natural setting of UCSC's Sinsheimer-Stanley Festival Glen, where it will be performed. Set in mythical Athens, the story of love and fairy magic--often involving the prankish sprite Puck--is directed by Tim Ocel, returning to the festival for his fourth season. Ocel directed _The Two Gentlemen of Verona _in 1999.  
  
"The main events in each play this season happen in one fateful night," Whitworth said. "In _A Midsummer Night's Dream,_ three separate worlds representing the flesh, the mind, and the spirit are entangled throughout one magical night. Shakespeare's most original comedy, it is also perhaps his most poetic. "  
  
Love is also a key ingredient in_ She Stoops to Conquer, _a 1773 comedy of_ _manners and mistaken identity. Beth F. Milles, whose credits include Julia Sweeney's _God Said, Ha!_on Broadway at the Lyceum Theater, is director.  
  
_"She Stoops to Conquer_ is a counterblast to the late 18th century's equivalent of political correctness," Whitworth said. "Set in a rumbling mansion, isolated in the depths of the country, every character in the play is a rich comic invention struggling to reconcile passion and propriety with hilarious results." _She Stoops to Conquer_ will also play in the Sinsheimer-Stanley Festival Glen.  
  
Those attending performances at the Sinsheimer-Stanley Festival Glen may bring picnic dinners or buy dinner at the site. Low-backed, short-legged beach chairs are allowed, and a limited number of chairs are available for rent. A special mobility-impaired seating area will be provided.   
  
Several events coinciding with the festival will provide opportunities for learning more about the productions.  
  
The popular Weekend with Shakespeare conference will focus on Shakespeare and Oliver Goldsmith this year. The weekend includes lectures and discussions exploring different aspects of the season's plays, as well as a forum with the directors and actors. The annual conference runs from Friday, August 17, through Sunday, August 19, at the UC Santa Cruz Theater Arts Center. For more information, call (831) 459-2159.  
  
"Noon at the Nick," a series of brown-bag discussions with festival directors, actors and designers, will be at the Nickelodeon Theater, 210 Lincoln Street. The free discussions are scheduled for Fridays, July 6, 13, 20, and 27, and August 3.   
  
Those wanting to see the stage up-close may take advantage of free backstage tours, available on Saturday mornings with reservations. Children under 6 are not allowed because of safety considerations. Call (831) 459-5109.  
  
Shakespeare Santa Cruz is planning some changes this year, according to Sara Wilbourne, company manager. The Sunday through Thursday evening performances have been moved up to 7:30 p.m. to better accommodate festivalgoers' weekday schedules. Evening performances on Friday and Saturday will continue to start at 8 p.m.  
  
The festival also hopes to provide transportation for audience members who have trouble climbing the hill to the glen. In addition, the glen will be spruced up and there will be "more of a festive atmosphere," in honor of the 20th anniversary, Wilbourne said.   
  
Those who bought festival tickets last year have the first chance to buy tickets, through a mailing being sent this week. A second mailing in early April goes to those who have bought single tickets and to lapsed subscribers. Sales to the general public begin May 1.   
  
The Family Sundays program offers a price break for those bringing children ages 5 through 18. On each of the five Sunday matinee performances, the festival is offering two special youth tickets with the purchase of each full price adult ticket. Youth ticketholders who appear to be over 18 may be asked to show identification.
