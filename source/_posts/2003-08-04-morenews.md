High school students visit Engineering School as part of leadership forum

The Baskin School of Engineering hosted 125 high school students from around the country in July as part of the National Youth Leadership Forum on Technology. The nine-day forum, based at the Fairmont Hotel in San Jose, included field trips to several universities and high-tech companies.   

The students who visited UCSC got a sense of what it would be like to study engineering here, touring the campus and the engineering school and hearing presentations from engineering dean Steve Kang and other faculty members.   

More information about the National Youth Leadership Forum is available on the web at <http://www.nylf.org.>
