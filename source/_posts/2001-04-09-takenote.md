<p>
  On Thursday, April 12, legendary climber and adventurer Jim Whittaker will present "A Life on the Edge - Memoirs of Everest and Beyond" at Porter College Dining Hall.

(REI), which he guided through years of record-setting growth. He guided Bobby Kennedy up the newly named Mount Kennedy, helping him to become the first person to summit the Canadian peak. He led the first and only International Peace Climb, which put climbers from the U.S., Russia, and China on the summit of Everest in the name of world peace. The presentation is a benefit for the UCSC adventure outings scholarships
