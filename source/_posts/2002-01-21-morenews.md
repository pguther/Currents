### Staff Advisory Board looking for musicians to perform at events

Coming soon to a staff event near you: The Slug Serenaders! But only if some musically talented performers come forward. The UCSC Staff Advisory Board would like to provide live music at upcoming staff events. If you're interested in performing or would like to suggest the name of a local group that might play, please contact board member Ryan Andrews at (831) 459-3970 or via e-mail at [randrews@cats.ucsc.edu][3].

"Our budget is limited, but it was really nice to have live music at the staff breakfast last spring," said Andrews, who has not ruled out the possibility of a group of university employees coming together just to perform at staff events.

"I don't know how much practice it would involve, but why not?" said Andrews. "I'm sure there's a lot of talent out there."
