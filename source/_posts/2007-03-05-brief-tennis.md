  Going in as the fourth seed in the Intercollegiate Tennis Association 2007 Division III National Team Indoor Championships, the UCSC men's tennis team defeated fifth-seed Trinity University 7-2 in the first round to reach the final four.
</p>
<p>
  In the semifinals, the Slugs faced top-seed and defending NCAA team champion Emory University, coached by former Slug John Browning. A 6-3 victory against Emory put the Slugs in the final, where they faced regional rival Claremont McKenna College. The Slugs were up to the task as they defeated the Stags with a striking 9-0 victory to claim the title. This was the men's tennis team's second ITA Indoor Team Championship and seventh overall team national championship. The team is coached by Bob Hansen.

  The indoor championships were hosted by Gustavus Adolphus College in St. Peter, Minnesota.
