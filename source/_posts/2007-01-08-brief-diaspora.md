  McHenry Library will be hosting a new exhibit featuring materials supporting Jewish studies through the 2007 winter quarter titled "From Torah to Diaspora: Highlights of the UCSC Library's Jewish Studies Collection."
</p>
<p>
  Focusing on how core texts such as the Torah have created a "portable homeland" for Jewish people during the Diaspora, the exhibit explores the diversity of the Jewish experience. In the process, the exhibit touches on the range of Biblical commentary from the traditional to the controversial, different approaches to ritual and observance, the experiences of Jews living around the world, Jewish cuisine, contributions to social justice movements, the experiences and contributions of Jewish women, influential modern Jewish thinkers, and the world of Jewish writing.
