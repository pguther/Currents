A May 20 forum on university housing for employees drew a range of comments, but everyone seemed to agree on one thing--the need to increase the number of units available.

"Until there is more housing stock, there's not going to be a solution," said William Friedland, emeritus professor of community studies and sociology. Friedland was one of about 60 people at the forum in Media Theater Room M110.

Audience comments at the forum, sponsored by the Campus Welfare Committee, followed a short [overview][1] of the current employee housing situation. The committee is soliciting public comments before putting together a recommendation on housing policy, as [directed][2] by John Simpson, campus provost and executive vice chancellor. A draft policy is expected in June. The Campus Welfare Committee is made up of administrators, Academic Senate members, Staff Advisory Board members, and graduate and undergraduate student representatives.

UCSC now has 130 units of rental and for-sale housing. That number is projected to reach 389 units with the planned acquisition of the 64-unit Laureate Court Apartments at Bay and High Streets and 95 new units to be built in Inclusion Area D. Additionally, current North Campus planning efforts include 100 units. This number may be adjusted following the work of the Growth and Stewardship Committee.

"We are pursuing all opportunities within and beyond the campus boundary," said Jean Marie Scott, associate vice chancellor for the colleges, housing, dining and child care services. "The biggest challenge for the campus is developing and delivering housing stock." Scott noted that UCSC has authorized an independent analysis of student and employee housing demands to help its planning. The analysis will be done during the upcoming weeks by the Sedway group.

The forum was open-ended, with members of the audience offering suggestions and criticism. Among the issues raised were:

* **Housing for all employees**. While called "faculty-staff housing," staff members' low priority on the waiting list means they have almost never had access to the housing in recent years. Ladder-rank faculty are given priority on both the rental and for-sale waiting lists. Audience suggestions included giving staff members equal priority, offering housing according to financial need, and giving priority to families, so that a single person did not have a three-bedroom house while a family of four had a small apartment. It was also suggested that housing no longer be called "faculty-staff housing" if staff members don't have access.
* **Off-campus vs. on-campus housing**. Several speakers suggested that UCSC concentrate its efforts on building on-campus housing rather than buy properties off-campus, because increasing the overall supply helps dampen area home prices.
* **Renting vs. buying.** Some suggested that more emphasis be placed on renting than buying, and that a program of rental assistance be established. Emergency housing assistance was also proposed.

The Campus Welfare Committee has received considerable e-mail feedback from the UCSC community through its [web site][3] and is continuing to seek input. Comments are printed out and distributed to committee members.   
  
Following feedback offered at the forum, the Campus Welfare Committee decided to hold a second housing forum once its preliminary draft is completed. The date, which may be in the fall, has not been set.
