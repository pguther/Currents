BEGIN STORY

Social sciences bibliographer Sheila O'Hare has been awarded a $7,500 competitive research grant from the Librarians Association of the University of California (LAUC), the librarians' equivalent of the Academic Senate. She will compile a chronological record of all California legal executions, beginning with the authorization of the death penalty in the Criminal Practices Act of 1851 and continuing to the present day.

O'Hare argues that even though the debate over the death penalty is ongoing and far from settled, a comprehensive reference source for California legal executions does not exist. Her research will culminate in a book containing a short narrative of each case and its unique legal, procedural, or sociological issues; demographic information for the executed individual and victims; images; and bibliographic references. O'Hare's publication will be structured to benefit academic and public libraries, death penalty opponents and advocates, legal practitioners, historians, criminal justice scholars, and the general public.
