#### Wondering what to do with that old monitor?

Don't throw it in the trash. It's now against the law to discard TVs or computer monitors as trash. Recent regulatory changes require these items to be recycled through campus surplus (a free service) or disposed of as hazardous waste (expensive). Contact Steve Goldie in Campus Surplus at (831) 459-2852 to arrange for recycling.  
  
For more information, check the [Campus Surplus web page][1] or the [EH&S web page][2], which includes information on what to do with broken or shattered units.

#### Gear up for summer

The [Outdoor Equipment Rental Center][6] at the Office of Physical Education, Recreation, and Sports (OPERS) can help you gear up for any trip or outdoor adventure this summer. The center is open to all students, staff, and faculty; it rents camping and mountaineering gear, water-sports equipment, and bicycle gear at extremely reasonable prices. Summer hours--Tuesdays and Thursdays from noon to 5:30 p.m.--are in effect through August 9. The rental shop is located upstairs in the East Field House. For more information, call (831) 459-2800.

#### Staff and faculty mentors sought

The Page and Eloise Smith Scholastic Society is bringing together UCSC alumni, faculty, and staff to serve the educational aspirations of UCSC students who are foster children, wards of the court, and orphans. There will be over 40 of these students on campus next fall. They will receive scholarships from the Page and Eloise Smith Scholastic Society, but they will also need other help.   
  
Can you help someone through the registration process? Could you correspond occasionally via e-mail with a student needing advice about a major? Perhaps you could help a new student connect with just the right faculty member to explore their visions or goals. If you are interested in any level of mentorship relationship with a current student who has been a foster child, ward of the court, or orphan, please contact Lynn Zachreson in the Alumni Office at ( 831) 459-5842.
