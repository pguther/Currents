  <a name="jones" id="jones"></a>Assistant police chief Jones coming home from hospital
</p>
<p>
  UCSC's assistant chief of police, Robert Jones, is coming home from the hospital April 7 after being struck by a car while bicycling in January. Jones remains in a coma, and a group of volunteers is being organized to assist his wife, Toni, with his care.
</p>
<p>
  Those wanting to help should call (831) 465-3300, (831) 425-2002 or e-mail <a href="mailto:susie@tlc.org">susie@tlc.org</a>. Prospective volunteers who are leaving a message should include the specific times of day they can help and the kind of help they would like to offer.
</p>
<p>
  Contributions to help with the cost of home health care for Jones may be sent to Friends of Robert Jones, in care of the UCSC Police Department, H Barn. Jones needs a Hill-Rom hospital-syle bed, which costs $15,000 new, and the family would welcome the donation of a used Hill-Rom bed. A committee with representatives of all law enforcement agencies in Santa Cruz County has begun planning a fundraising event on Jones's behalf, said UCSC Police Chief Mickey Aluffi.<br>

  <a name="parking" id="parking"></a>Park your motorcycle for free in a remote lot
</p>
<p>
  TAPS is now offering free remote parking for motorcycles as part of an effort to to accommodate more parking on campus. This program is available to all faculty, staff, and students, although the number of permits is limited and they are available on a first-come, first-served basis.
</p>
<p>
  The free spaces are located in these lots:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>East Remote (Lot 104), about 12 to 15 spaces<br>
  </li>
  <li>West Remote (Lot 127), about 6 spaces<br>
  </li>
  <li>Granary/Child Care Center (Lot 118), 10 spaces<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Commuters can apply for a free permit online (<a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/taps/freeremotemotorcycle.html">apply online</a>) at or at the TAPS Sales Office. Those with a current valid motorcycle permit who want to park in the free remote motorcycle parking areas can turn in their current permit at the TAPS Sales Office, receive a refund, and get a new permit valid only in the free remote motorcycle spaces.
</p>
<p>
  NOTE: If there are no designated motorcycle parking spaces available in these remote lots, commuters must return to the sales office and purchase a daily motorcycle permit allowing them to park in other motorcycle spaces.<br>
</p>
<p>
