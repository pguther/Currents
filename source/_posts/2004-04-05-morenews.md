News Briefs

Assistant police chief Jones coming home from hospital

UCSC's assistant chief of police, Robert Jones, is coming home from the hospital April 7 after being struck by a car while bicycling in January. Jones remains in a coma, and a group of volunteers is being organized to assist his wife, Toni, with his care.

Those wanting to help should call (831) 465-3300, (831) 425-2002 or e-mail [susie@tlc.org][1]. Prospective volunteers who are leaving a message should include the specific times of day they can help and the kind of help they would like to offer.

Contributions to help with the cost of home health care for Jones may be sent to Friends of Robert Jones, in care of the UCSC Police Department, H Barn. Jones needs a Hill-Rom hospital-syle bed, which costs $15,000 new, and the family would welcome the donation of a used Hill-Rom bed. A committee with representatives of all law enforcement agencies in Santa Cruz County has begun planning a fundraising event on Jones's behalf, said UCSC Police Chief Mickey Aluffi.
