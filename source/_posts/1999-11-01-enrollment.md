For the third year in a row, UCSC's third-week census figures reveal the highest enrollment in campus history. Total enrollment is set at 11,302--an increase of 321 students, or 3 percent, over last fall, according to the Office of Planning and Budget. The total includes 7,588 continuing students, 189 returning students, and 3,525 new students. Undergraduates number 10,242, while graduate students total 1,060. The number of new undergraduates who identified themselves as Asian, Chicano, Latino, American Indian, African American, Filipino, and other minorities was up slightly from 1,027 at this time last year to 1,057 this fall. Among new freshmen only, the total increased from 814 to 824 students.
