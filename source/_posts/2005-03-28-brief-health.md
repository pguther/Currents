The first Native American Health Disparities Forum will be held April 8-9 at Stevenson College Event Center. The event is free and open to the public. Those interested in attending may register at the Silverman Conference Room on the day of the Forum or online at the web site listed below.

Focused on "addressing the atmosphere that promotes ill health," the forum is cosponsored by the National Institute of General Medical Science, the UCSC American Indian Resource Center, the UCSC Office of Physical Education, Recreation, Sports, and Wellness (OPERS), and Stevenson College.

Keynote speaker Dr. [Lori Arviso Alvord][1], a Navajo, surgeon and member of the Dartmouth Medical School faculty, will discuss diabetes and nutrition. Renya Ramirez, assistant professor in UCSC's Department of American Studies, and Ryan Andrews, director of the Wellness Center, will be among those conducting workshops.

The second day of the event will include a 5K run/walk, with runners such as Apache/Yaqui [Clint Wells][2], a 2004 Olympic Trials participant, who will be available to discuss exercise afterward.

Additional details on the forum, including registration information, are available online at [www2.ucsc.edu/narc/forum][3].
