  <a name="osp" id="osp"></a>Committee seeks input from users of services provided by the Office of Sponsored Projects
</p>
<p>
  Vice chancellor for research Robert Miller has convened a committee to carry out a review of the Office of Sponsored Projects (OSP). This is a critical time for the campus in that the need for external funding is growing, and the growth in the campus will accompany significant increases in workload for OSP. The committee would like to hear from the user community--both faculty and nonfaculty users of the office. The committee would like to know:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>What are your needs as a member of the OSP user community?<br>
  </li>
  <li>What aspects of OSP are being done well and what aspects need to be improved?<br>
  </li>
  <li>What functions should OSP be performing that it is not doing at present?<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  The committee welcomes all input and invites direct contact with committee members. Individuals on the committee will be reaching out to people in their own divisions, but input to any committee member will be considered by the group as a whole. Individuals not affiliated with an academic division may contact committee chair Eli Silver (see contact information below).<br>
</p>
<p>
  The committee plans to complete the review before the end of spring quarter and would like your input as early as possible to help focus its efforts. Input will be accepted and considered at anytime during the review but will have the most impact if received by April 7.<br>

  <span class="sectionhead"><a name="yung" id="yung"></a>Judy Yung will speak on March 25 as part of a new Diversity Lecture Series</span><br>
</p>
<p>
  American studies professor Judy Yung will present a slide/talk featuring the personal stories of women in Chinese American history on Tuesday, March 25, from noon to 1:30 p.m. at the Bay Tree Building, Conference Room D. See <i><a href="../03-03/women.html">Currents</a></i> <a href="../03-03/women.html">article</a><br>
</p>
<p>
  The event is part of a new Diversity Lecture Series sponsored by the Office of Equal Employment Opportunity/Affirmative Action. All UCSC faculty and staff are invited to attend.
</p>
<p>
  The presentation is based on extensive research Yung conducted for her latest book, <i>Unbound Voices: A Documentary History of Chinese Women in San Francisco.</i> Drawing upon an intimate collection of letters, poems, autobiographies, newspaper clippings, and oral histories, the book portrays the lives of 40 Chinese American women from the late 1800s through World War II, creating a picture of their ability to make a home for themselves in America, despite severe racial, economic, and cultural constraints.
</p>
