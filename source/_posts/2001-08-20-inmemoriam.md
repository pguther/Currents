**Crisie Mejias**, a sophomore biology major and College Nine student, was found slain on August 6 in Jacksonville, Fla. She had been living with her family in Florida for the summer. A suspect has been arrested and charged with murder in her death. Mejias's sister, Tisha, described Crisie Mejias as "very intellectual and very confident, but kind of a shy person," the _Florida Times-Union _newspaper reported. Plans for a remembrance at College Nine have not been finalized. Call Wendy Baxter, College Nine programs coordinator, at (831) 459-3142 or e-mail her at [wbaxter@cats.ucsc.edu][1] for more information.
