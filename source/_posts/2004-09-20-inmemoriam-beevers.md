  The life of plant physiologist Harry Beevers, who died in April at the age of 80, will be celebrated in a memorial program on Saturday, September 25, at the UCSC Arboretum. The event will begin at 1 p.m. in the Arboretum amphitheater, followed by a reception in the Arboretum lecture hall.

  Beevers, a professor emeritus of biology at UCSC, was a popular teacher and an eminent researcher who made major contributions to the understanding of plant metabolism and plant cell biology. (See <a href="http://currents.ucsc.edu/03-04/04-19/inmemoriam.html">April 19 Currents article</a>)

  Scheduled speakers at the memorial celebration include UCSC Chancellor Emeritus Robert Sinsheimer, professor emeritus of ecology and evolutionary biology William Doyle, and professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology Lincoln Taiz. Other speakers will be coming from as far away as Japan. Members of the Beevers family will also take part in the program.
