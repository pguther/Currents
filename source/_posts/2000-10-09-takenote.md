<p>
  <img align="right" alt="book cover from Nobody Left to Hate by Elliot Aronson" border="1" height="140" src="../art/nobody_left.jpg" width="97">Elliot Aronson, professor emeritus of psychology, will talk about his book, <i>Nobody Left to Hate: Teaching Compassion After Columbine,</i> at the <a href="http://www.capitolabookcafe.com">Capitola Book Cafe</a> on Wednesday, October 11, at 7:30 p.m. In <i>Nobody Left to Hate</i>, Aronson argues that the negative atmosphere in our schools may have contributed to the pathological behaviors of the shooters at Columbine High School, and at the very least, continues to make school unpleasant for most normal students. He offers practical strategies for creating a more supportive, stimulating, and compassionate environment that will make schools safer and more humane places of learning. The Capitola Book Cafe is located at 1475 41st Avenue in Capitola; for more information, call (831) 462-4415.
