Artwork by clients of Front Street Mental Health Services will be showcased at the Graduate Student Commons in Quarry Plaza beginning September 23 and continuing through the rest of fall quarter. A reception at 2 p.m. September 23 will launch the show.

The exhibition is a joint project of the Graduate Student Commons Governance Board and Bill Manchester, Quarry Plaza groundskeeper/gardener, who has taught Front Street clients art for the last 10 years.

"Art allows my students to transcend their abilities and express themselves wholeheartedly in what they want to display," Manchester said.

Front Street Mental Health Services is a community organization designed to achieve the highest level of mental, social, and physical wellness of the clients it serves.
