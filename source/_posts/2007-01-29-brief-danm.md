  UCSC's Digital Arts and New Media M.F.A. Program (DANM) is sponsoring a presentation by Christiane Paul--adjunct curator of new media arts at the Whitney Museum of American Art and director of Intelligent Agent, a service organization and information resource dedicated to digital art--on Monday, February 5. The event will take place from 4 to 6 p.m. at the Cowell College Conference Room (Cowell 132). Admission is free and open to the public.
</p>
<p>
  Titled "Digital Art--Public Space," the presentation will give an overview of the ways in which digital art has expanded, challenged, or even redefined notions of public art and space. Among the topics to be discussed are enhanced possibilities of interventions in public space; the network as public space; remote intervention in a site-specific public installation (telepresence); the enhancement of physical sites and existing architecture; and the merging of physical and virtual space.
</p>
<p>
  Paul has written extensively on new media arts. Her book <i>Digital Art</i> (part of the World of Art Series by Thames &amp; Hudson, U.K.) was published in 2003, and she is currently editing an anthology on "Curating New Media" (forthcoming from UC Press) and coediting--with Victoria Vesna and Margot Lovejoy--a book on context and meaning in digital art (forthcoming from University of Minnesota Press).
</p>
<p>
  Paul teaches as an adjunct in the M.F.A. programs of the Computer Art Department at the School of Visual Arts in New York and the Digital Media Department of the Rhode Island School of Design, and has lectured internationally on art and technology. At the Whitney Museum she curated the show "Data Dynamics" (2001); the net art selection for the 2002 Whitney Biennial; the online exhibition "CODeDOC" (2002) for artport, the Whitney Museum's online portal to Internet art, for which she is responsible; as well as "Follow Through" by Scott Paterson and Jennifer Crowe (2005).
