<p>
  UCSC students, asked last week to vote in an online election to determine whether they want to establish a fee to help maintain existing student programs threatened by budget cuts, overwhelmingly approved the measure. Of the 5,031 votes cast, 4,565 students (90.74 percent) voted in favor of Measure 7.

<p>
  The Student Fee Advisory Committee (SFAC), a student committee that makes recommendations about funding student programs, sponsored this referendum. College governments, the undergraduate student government (SUA), and the graduate student government (GSA) also endorsed asking UCSC students to weigh in on this measure.<br>
  <br>
  Measure 7 asked: "In order to help preserve the existing variety and quality of UCSC Student Programs, shall students assess themselves up to $51 per quarter commencing Fall Quarter 2003?"<br>
