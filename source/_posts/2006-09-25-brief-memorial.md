The University Religious Council is inviting members of the campus community to an event to remember those who have died (Chancellor Denton, other members of the university community, friends and family and others) and celebrate the gift of their lives.

The event will take place from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Tuesday, September 26, and Wednesday, September 27, in Bay Tree Plaza.

Students, staff, and faculty are welcome to drop by to share with words and/or artistic expressions their feelings about loss and change.

University Religious Council representatives will be available for spiritual counseling and Counseling & Psychological Services, a cosponsor of the event, will also offer support.
