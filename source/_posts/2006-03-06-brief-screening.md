  San Francisco-based filmmaker Jenni Olson--whose film <i>The Joy of Life</i> debuted at the Sundance Film Festival in 2005--will present a free public screening of her movie on Wednesday, March 8, at 7 p.m. in the Communications Building, Room 150. The event is sponsored by UCSC's Film and Digital Media Department and the Sexuality Studies Group.

<p>
  Since its premiere at Sundance, this innovative feature film has played a pivotal role in renewing debate about the need for a suicide barrier on the Golden Gate Bridge. <i>The Joy of Life</i> has earned awards from both the New York and Los Angeles Lesbian &amp; Gay Film Festivals, and has been praised by critics for its unique style and dynamic vision.
</p>
<p>
  Described by the <i>Village Voice</i> as "thrillingly minimalist," the film unites landscape shots of a hauntingly vacant San Francisco with noir-style voiceovers that combine romantic poetry, cinema-studies esoterica, and the contested politics of the Golden Gate Bridge with its open invitation to suicides. It combines stunning 16mm landscape cinematography with a bold, lyrical voiceover (performed by L.A.-based artist/actor Harriet "Harry" Dodge) to share two San Francisco stories: the history of the Golden Gate Bridge as a suicide landmark, and the story of a butch dyke in San Francisco searching for love and self-discovery.
</p>
<p>
  The two stories are punctuated by Lawrence Ferlinghetti's reading of his ode to San Francisco, <i>The Changing Light</i>, and bookended by opening and closing credits music from legendary '50s icon (and presumed Golden Gate suicide) Weldon Kees.
