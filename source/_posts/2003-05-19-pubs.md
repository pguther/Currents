  Book on Andean festival of Corpus Christi by Carolyn Dean published in Spanish
</p>
<p>
  <i><img align="right" height="166" src="../art/inka%20bodies_dean.jpg" width="108" alt="">Inka Bodies and the Body of Christ: Corpus Christi in Colonial Cuzco, Peru</i>, a book by associate professor and Art History Department chair Carolyn Dean, has been published in Spanish. In <i>Inka Bodies,</i> Dean investigates the multiple meanings of the Roman Catholic feast of Corpus Christi as it was performed in the Andean city of Cuzco after the Spanish conquest.
</p>
<p>
  The book was originally put out by Duke University Press in 1999. Last year, Dean was contacted by Professor Manuel Burga of the Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos (UNMSM) in Lima, Peru, who wanted to publish a Spanish translation through his university's press.
</p>
<p>
  The translation was funded by a grant from the Pew Charitable Trusts, and the result is a revised edition, in Spanish, with over 30 color plates. The Spanish title is <i>Los Cuerpos de los Incas y el cuerpo de Cristo: El Corpus Christi en el Cuzco, Colonial.</i> It came off the presses in February and is now being distributed in Latin America by UNMSM.
