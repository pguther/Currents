Web-based learning, collaborations, and knowledge networks are the focus of an upcoming conference at UCSC. The Tech Innovation 2000 conference takes place Friday and Saturday, October 13 and 14, and is free. UCSC faculty and students, K-12 teachers, and others involved in the field of education are encouraged to attend.

The Tech Innovation 2000 program highlights technological tools, collaborative projects, and knowledge networks used at the university and for its outreach to K-12 schools.

At the conference, UCSC and UC Berkeley faculty and staff, leaders in the field from SRI International, and professional developers of virtual environments and communities will provide an up-to-date overview of the latest programs and technologies that support course delivery and facilitate communication.

The conference is sponsored by Communications and Technology Services (CATS)/Instructional Computing and the UC College Prep Inititiative.
