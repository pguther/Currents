  UCSC staff member Myriah Jasper was recognized at the quarterly meeting of the Council of University of California Staff Assemblies in December for her "exemplary commitment to the Santa Cruz Community and her inspiration to others."
</p>
<p>
  "Myriah has overcome many life challenges, including being a single parent of four children and struggling to overcome being homeless in Santa Cruz," said associate vice chancellor of Colleges and University Housing Services Jean Marie Scott in presenting Jasper's award. "Throughout all of her challenges, she has persevered. She is a woman of great courage, great compassion, and great fortitude."
</p>
<p>
  Jasper joined the UCSC staff in 1998 and has been a member of the Colleges and University Housing Services Human Resources unit.
</p>
<p>
  UCSC's Staff Advisory Board played host to the council December 8-9 (see <a href="http://currents.ucsc.edu/05-06/12-05/brief-council.asp">Currents story</a>), and selected Jasper for the award. Jasper provided a short presentation on her work with community groups, including her efforts to bridge the digital divide.
