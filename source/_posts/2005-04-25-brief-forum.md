The Staff Advisory Board will be holding the first General Staff Forum on April 27 from 12:15 to 1:30 p.m. at the Stevenson Fireside Lounge.

This is an excellent opportunity for staff to interact with Staff Advisory Board members, network with each other, and help establish goals for next year.

Presenters will be Robert Kemp on the TAPS Advisory Committee, Ciel Benedetto on health care, Norma Ray on student fees, Judy Scarborough on child care, Ed Titus on campus welfare and CUCSA, and Scott Loosely on Site Stewardship.

Refreshments will be provided.
