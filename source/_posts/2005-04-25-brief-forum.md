  The Staff Advisory Board will be holding the first General Staff Forum on April 27 from 12:15 to 1:30 p.m. at the Stevenson Fireside Lounge.

<p>
  This is an excellent opportunity for staff to interact with Staff Advisory Board members, network with each other, and help establish goals for next year. <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/police/liondoc1.html"></a>
