The University of Chicago has awarded an honorary D.Sc. degree to Sandra Faber, University Professor and chair of the Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics. Faber received the degree at a ceremony on October 27 during the inauguration of Robert J. Zimmer as president of the university.

At the inauguration ceremony, Zimmer presented honorary degrees to Faber and six other scholars. In honoring Faber, the University of Chicago recognized her accomplishments in observational astronomy, particularly in the field of galaxy formation and evolution, as well as her leadership in the design and construction of the DEIMOS spectrograph, one of the most powerful instruments of the Keck 10-meter telescopes.
