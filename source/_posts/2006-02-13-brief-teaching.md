Called "Setting the Stage for Learning: Building Student Confidence, Control, and Competence," the event will also feature exhibits and sessions on topics including technology in teaching, diversity, student research, and teaching large classes.

Professor Martin M. Chemers will deliver the symposium's keynote address, "Psychological Factors in Student Success." Chemers will also report on research conducted with first-year students at UCSC and describe the theoretical model guiding his current research on underrepresented students in science and engineering.
