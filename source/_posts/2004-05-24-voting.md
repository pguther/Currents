UCSC students will decide on a proposed fee increase and Student Union Assembly candidates, as well as other several measures when they vote online May 21-28.  

The "Student Voice and Empowerment Fee" measure asks undergraduates whether they want to assess themselves 50 cents per quarter permanently to fund the Student Committee on Committees (SCOC).

"This will enable SCOC to ensure student representation and voice on major campus committees, ensure communication with and between student representatives on committees, and facilitate campuswide outreach for available positions," the ballot states.   

Also at stake are constitutional amendments for the Student Union Assembly and Stevenson Student Council.   

Nonbinding "opinion polls" on the ballot seek student views:  

* **Campus Sustainability Coordinators: **"Do the students of UCSC support funding for two Campus Sustainability Coordinators who will work with students, staff, faculty, administration, and the community (specifically University Dining Services) to reduce energy usage, improve resource conservation, and increase the overall sustainability of the UCSC campus through education, outreach, data collection, and program implementation?  
* **Biodiesel Production Program:**   
"Should undergraduates assess themselves a fee to create a biodiesel production program (with Transportation and Parking Services (TAPS) and the Campus Sustainability Council (CSC)), to turn waste cooking grease from our dining halls into bio-diesel fuel for University diesel engines?"   

* **Student Union Assembly Survey:**  
A wide range of questions are covered in this section of the ballot, from UCSC's college system to awareness of student government to "How many students should there be on campus within the next 15 years?"
