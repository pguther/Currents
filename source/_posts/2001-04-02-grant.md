  A Silicon Valley organization that brings teachers and industry together in an effort to improve science and math education has received a boost from UCSC.
</p>Industry Initiatives in Science and Math Education (IISME) has been given $53,000 in a challenge grant to develop an interactive web site to help match interested teachers and companies. Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood presented the check March 16 to IISME executive director Matty Bloom.
<p>
  J. Michael Thompson, associate vice chancellor of Outreach, Admissions, and Student Academic Services, said the program provides teachers with a variety of summer work experiences. "Teachers get intellectually refreshed, and they also get some real-world grounding, which they infuse into their teaching," he said.<br>
  <br>
  The organization's summer fellowship program matches teachers of all subjects with mentored, paid summer jobs at high-technology companies, government agencies, and university laboratories, including UCSC's natural sciences labs. IISME also offers year-round assistance to teachers applying what they have learned during the summer.<br>
  <br>
  "The new website has already shown a return on investment with a record-breaking 450-plus teachers applying online for this summer's Fellowship Program," said Bloom. "Our corporate sponsors are showing outstanding support for this project and have contributed an additional $100,000 in cash and $50,000 in-kind, tripling UCSC's generous challenge gift of $53,600 to meet our goal. We are very excited about the efficiencies we will continue to reap from the project."<br>
  <br>
  The organization was founded in 1985 by a consortium of San Francisco Bay Area industries in partnership with the Lawrence Hall of Science at the University of California, Berkeley. The major participating sponsors this year, in addition to UCSC, are Intel, IBM, Compaq, and National Semiconductor.<br>
  <br>
  Thompson said the gift, which requires that the amount be matched by another source, encourages new approaches to education. Community college teachers and K-12 teachers are eligible for the partnerships.<br>
  <br>
  The gift was not the first time UCSC has helped the organization. UCSC has previously provided assistance for a newsletter and a similar challenge grant to hire an educational director.<br>
  <br>
  Bloom said the organization's work ties in well with UCSC's interests. "If we serve more teachers, then students will be better prepared in math and science and other fields," she said, leading to better-prepared students at UCSC.
