  In his opening remarks at the fall-quarter meeting of UCSC's Academic Senate, Campus Provost David Kliger described six operational areas of the campus that he considers priorities for the current year.
</p>
<p>
  The six are:<br>
  <br>
  * <strong>Increase the rate of faculty hiring.</strong> While the campus already has projections for the ultimate size of each Academic Division, Kliger said he will make short-term investments that will "increase the rate" of faculty hiring in the near future.<br>
  <br>
  * <strong>Provide additional support to units and/or activities that generate money for the campus.</strong> UCSC, he said, should "invest in those areas of campus that will generate more revenue," he said, citing University Relations, the Office of Research, and Graduate Studies as examples of such areas.<br>
  <br>
  * <strong>Replenish UCSC's leadership team.</strong> Kliger noted that the campus is engaged in three searches for deans and a number of other senior-level posts. "These are all going to be critical positions for us," he said.<br>
  <br>
  * <strong>Make additional progress consolidating UCSC's information technology and business processes.</strong> Kliger described himself as "surprised and pleased" by how smoothly the consolidations have gone to date, but said a tremendous amount of work remains to be done to ensure optimal service to campus units.<br>
  <br>
  * <strong>Improve employee compensation.</strong> Kliger said the state budget and UC Office of the President are significant drivers of this, but added that "the chancellor and I have it as a high priority to push this issue at a systemwide level."<br>
  <br>
  * <strong>Look for additional solutions to UCSC's faculty housing difficulties.</strong> In addition to getting construction started on Ranch View Terrace, Kliger said he will seek to "maximize affordability" by exploring possibilities on a number of fronts--including support for new Office of the President loan programs and funding, an augmentation of campus financing, and a modification of resale policies for existing units.<br>
  <br>
  "We have a lot of challenges ahead of us," Kliger concluded. "But challenges are what keep life interesting."
