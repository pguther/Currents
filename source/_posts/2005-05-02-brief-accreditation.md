UCSC Child Care and Early Education Services (CCEES) has earned accreditation from the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC)--the nation's leading organization of early childhood professionals.

"We're proud to be accredited by NAEYC and recognized for our commitment to reaching the highest professional standards," said Wilma Gold, director of the program. "NAEYC accreditation lets families in our community know that children in our program are getting the best care and early learning experiences".

CCEES includes an infant and toddler program, the Granary Child Development Center, the Children's Center Preschool, and the School Age Center. These four programs serve 120 children from three months to 12 years. All the programs are included in the accreditation.  

To earn NAEYC's accreditation, a program conducts a self-study to determine how well it meets the standards. After necessary improvements are made, the program is observed by independent professional validators and then reviewed by a national panel. Programs are accredited by NAEYC for a five-year period.

The recent NAEYC accreditation coincided with the initiation of a Guest Reader Program at the Granary. To raise visibility, momentum, and excitement for child care, Associate Vice Chancellor Jean Marie Scott kicked off the new program on March 30 by reading two of her favorite books,_ The Little Rabbit and the Sea_ and _The Big Hungry Bear_. The next guest reader will be professor of psychology Maureen Callanan.
