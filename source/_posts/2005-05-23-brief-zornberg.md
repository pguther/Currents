  The Jewish Studies Program will present a lecture by Avivah Gottlieb Zornberg, titled "Seduced into Eden: The Beginning of Desire," on Wednesday, May 25, at Stevenson College Room 150 from 7 to 9 p.m. The lecture is free and open to the public.

  Zornberg's first book, <i>Genesis: The Beginning of Desire</i> (published by Doubleday), won the National Jewish Book Award for nonfiction in 1995, and Zornberg appeared on Bill Moyers's PBS program <i>Genesis: A Living Conversation</i>. Her most recent book, <i>The Particulars of Rapture: Reflections on Exodus</i>, was also published by Doubleday in 2001.

  Zornberg holds a Ph.D. in English literature from Cambridge University, studied at Gateshead Seminary and the Jerusalem Michlala, and taught English literature at the Hebrew University from 1969 to 1976. She brings classical Jewish biblical study and commentary into dialogue with contemporary critical theory and psychoanalytic perspectives. Working with literary and religious materials, she lectures and teaches a wide range of courses in Israel, England, and the United States.
