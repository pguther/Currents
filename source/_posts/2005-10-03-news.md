American studies professor **Tricia Rose** appeared as a guest on a special broadcast of National Public Radio's _Talk of the Nation_ program about race, poverty and Hurricane Katrina.

Literature professor **Paul Skenazy** contributed five brief book reviews to the _Washington Post._

_USA Today_, the _Wall Street Journal, _and many other newspapers picked up a story about economist **Rob Fairlie's **latest study, which found that U.S. entrepreneurs launch an average of about 550,000 new businesses each month and that start-up growth has been steady over the past decade. _CNNMoney.com_ also picked up the story.

History professor **Dana Frank** was quoted in the _Ventura County Star_ about what it really means to buy American, noting that "trade policy, not consumer demand, drives global commerce" as it creates job losses and closed plants, and hurts workers while boosting corporate bottom lines.
