<p>
  In a repeat performance of their well-received Halliday Lecture in March, cosmologist Joel Primack and his wife, Nancy Abrams, will give a multimedia presentation of "The View from the Center of the Universe" on Tuesday, May 9.
</p>
<p>
  The event, which is free and open to the public, will take place at 8 p.m. in the Media Theater.
</p>
<p>
  The presentation is based on the new book by Primack and Abrams, <i>The View from the Center of the Universe: Discovering Our Extraordinary Place in the Cosmos</i> (Penguin/Riverhead, April 2006). Primack is a professor of physics at UCSC, and Abrams is a writer and scholar interested in the history and philosophy of science. They argue that for the first time in human history a scientific theory of the universe as a whole is emerging--a theory that explains how the universe operates, what it's made of, where it came from, and how it is evolving.
</p>
<p>
  Their presentation explains and visualizes the evolution of the universe, the fact that the universe is made mostly of dark matter and dark energy, with visible matter making up only about half a percent of the total, and the remarkable fact that humans--and indeed intelligent life anywhere in the universe--must have a size that is in the middle of all possible size scales. They show spectacular new images and videos, using both updated ancient symbols and the latest astronomical data and simulations. The talk is both entertaining and educational, and it can be enjoyed by everyone from people who know nothing about modern astronomy to experts in the field.
