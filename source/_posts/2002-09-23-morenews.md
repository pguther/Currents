  <a name="traffic" id="traffic"></a>Campus and city police join forces to minimize traffic impact on Westside neighborhoods
</p>
<p>
  With the new academic year upon us, Westside Santa Cruz neighbors have requested that campus commuters using cars take the main thoroughfares of Mission, Bay, and High Streets so that the traffic and safety impacts in residential areas are minimized. Toward that end, the UCSC and Santa Cruz Police Departments are combining traffic enforcement resources on September 25 and have initiated a "Pace Car" program in the neighborhoods.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Both activities are explained in a <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/messages/02-03/09-20.traffic_safety.html">letter to the campus community</a> from Wes Scott, director of Transportation and Parking Services. In the letter, Scott also encourages members of the campus community to use alternative transportation whenever possible in an effort to reduce the number of cars traveling on the streets that lead to and from the campus.<br>

  <a name="search" id="search"></a>Search is on to replace Whole Earth Restaurant
</p>
<p>
  The search is under way for a new vendor to replace the Whole Earth Restaurant, which closed in July because of financial difficulties.
</p>
<p>
  The Graduate Student Governance Board, which owns the restaurant as part of the Graduate Commons, is putting the final touches on bid packages to be sent out to those who have expressed an interest in running the restaurant. The board is also seeking a temporary vendor until a permanent vendor is selected.<br>
</p>
<p>
  In the meantime, the Express Store across from the restaurant has expanded its offerings, and is selling sushi and salads, as well as sandwiches. Frozen and canned foods are also available, and there is a microwave on the premises. The restaurant's outdoor dining area remains open.<br>
