The Tabia African-American Theatre Ensemble will perform the play "For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide When the Rainbow is Enuf," October 27 at UCSC.

Presented by UCSC's Rainbow Theatre, the play by the San Jose-based troupe will be performed at 9 p.m. at the Stevenson Event Center.

The play, which debuted on Broadway in 1976, is a series of poems performed through a cast of nameless women, known only by color. Subjects of the poems include love, abandonment, rape, and abortion.

The performance is free and open to the public.
