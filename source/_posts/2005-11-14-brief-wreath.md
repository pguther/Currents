Wonderful holiday decorations and gifts will be available from the UCSC Arboretum at the annual Dried Flower and Succulent Wreath Sale on Saturday and Sunday, November 19 and 20. Exotic dried flower arrangements, living succulent wreaths, rare and unusual succulent plants, and materials for making your own gifts are among the offerings at this year's sale.

Sale hours will be 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Saturday and 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. on Sunday. The sale will be held at the Horticulture Building in the Arboretum, located on High Street (Empire Grade) between the two entrances to the UCSC campus.

Many different kinds of wreaths will be available, some featuring featherlike and conelike flower parts from plants in the protea family and others made of colorful dried perennials and herbs. The Arboretum's extensive collections of South African and Australian plants provide a variety of unusual dried plant materials for use in wreaths and arrangements. Dried flowers and foliages will be available singly, by the bunch, and in arrangements.

There will be living wreaths planted with succulents that will last three to four years. Dish gardens, landscaping plants, cacti, and gift books round out the selections.

The Dried Flower and Succulent Wreath Sale is an all-volunteer effort featuring materials grown at the Arboretum or donated by volunteers. All proceeds benefit the Arboretum.

The UCSC Arboretum is open to visitors from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. every day. Norrie's Gifts is open every day from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Hours for the Jean and Bill Lane Horticultural Library are online at <http://www.kestrel-press.com/arbcal>/.
