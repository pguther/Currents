UCSC's McHenry Library presents "New Work from Moving Parts Press: _COSMOGONIE INTIME_," an exhibit running through December 8 at Special Collections. A reception will be held on December 3, from 2 to 4 p.m.

The exhibit features _COSMOGONIE INTIME_, a newly published, limited-edition, bilingual collaborative book of art featuring French poet Yves Peyre, visual artist Ray Rice, translator Elizabeth R. Jackson, and award-winning book artist Felicia Rice, who founded Moving Parts Press in 1977. Paintings by Ray Rice will also be on display.

A painter, mosaicist, and animator of experimental films, Rice died in 2001 at the age of 85. His animated art films are part of UCSC's Special Collections archive. Rice contributed 17 pen-and-ink drawings as well as hand-painted the bastard title, or half-title, in all 96 copies of the book. Twelve deluxe copies were completely hand-painted by Rice, whom renowned French contemporary poet Peyre personally selected to contribute the visual art for the five intimate, universal poems that form the collection. The paintings that inspired Peyre to choose Rice are part of the Special Collections exhibit.

Book artist, publisher, and educator Felicia Rice has been a letterpress printer in Santa Cruz since 1973. Her books are housed in collections that range from the Whitney Museum in New York to the Victoria & Albert Museum in London. She is currently the program manager of the Digital Arts and New Media M.F.A. Program at UCSC.
