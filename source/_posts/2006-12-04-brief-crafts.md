Talented campus staff members will be selling a variety of handmade gifts, cards, and decorations on Friday, December 8, in Bay Tree Conference Room D from 11:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. Ten percent of sales benefit the UCSC Women at Work Retreat scholarship fund.

Items for sale will include cut flowers and arrangements, orchids, bead and wire jewelry, knitted crafts, fabric bags and purses, tole painting, fleece blankets, festive cards, mosaic stepping stones and flower pots, and holiday stockings. Only checks and cash will be accepted.
