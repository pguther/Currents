UC discloses venture capital data

The University of California has posted on the web performance data for its $2.1 billion private-equity portfolio, after losing an appeal to the California Supreme Court. A state Superior Court ruled in July that the information had to be released.

The university was sued in April by the _San Jose Mercury News_, the Coalition of University Employees, and a Berkeley professor, who wanted data related to fund-level performance and the internal rates of return (IRR) for UC's venture capital funds made public. [Detailed IRR information][5] (pdf)

In its appeal, the university contended that the IRRs are trade secrets and therefore exempt from disclosure under the California Public Records Act and also that disclosure of such confidential information would result in the university being excluded from future investment in these funds. See text of UC [press release][6] on the appeal.
