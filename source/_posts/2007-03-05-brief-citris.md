CITRIS--the [Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society][1]\--is accepting proposals for its second annual White Paper competition, which will give away $25K in cash prizes for the best ideas that demonstrate the ability of IT to address a major societal challenge. The IT for Society contest is open to students from all four CITRIS campuses: UC Berkeley, UC Merced, UC Santa Cruz, and UC Davis.
