Happy H. Hunter, a longtime staff member who retired in 1991, died August 15 of natural causes in Orting, Washington. She was 63.

Hunter began working at UCSC in 1966, first managing the faculty services office in natural sciences and then becoming coordinator of Services to Academic Staff, which oversaw all academic departments and faculty services offices.

"She was a presence on campus in the early years who was especially gifted at matching people to jobs and building a fine faculty support unit," said Betsy Wootten, coordinator of Humanities Faculty Services and a former colleague of Hunter's.
