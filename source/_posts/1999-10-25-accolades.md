#### UCSC Summer Session

UCSC Summer Session has received this year's "Exemplary Programs Award" from the Western Association of Summer Session Administrators (WASSA) for the Seaside Junior High School Math/Science Institute. The institute was launched five years ago to reach out to young students in the Seaside area and bring them to campus for a challenging course of study and a residential life experience.   
  
Five of the the institute's "graduates" have applied to UCSC. Before attending the program, none of the students selected for the Seaside Junior High School Math/Science Institute had been to the campus and few had planned to seek degrees, according to Judith McCarrick, Summer Session dean.

"I'm very pleased with the WASSA honor, but I'm more excited to think that our efforts are creating opportunities for students in our communities," said McCarrick.  
  
Summer Session also took fourth place for catalog design at the WASSA conference, where most member institutions submit their catalogs for critique.
