</h4>
<p>
  UCSC Summer Session has received this year's "Exemplary Programs Award" from the Western Association of Summer Session Administrators (WASSA) for the Seaside Junior High School Math/Science Institute. The institute was launched five years ago to reach out to young students in the Seaside area and bring them to campus for a challenging course of study and a residential life experience.<br>
  <br>
  Five of the the institute's "graduates" have applied to UCSC. Before attending the program, none of the students selected for the Seaside Junior High School Math/Science Institute had been to the campus and few had planned to seek degrees, according to Judith McCarrick, Summer Session dean.
</p>
<p>
  "I'm very pleased with the WASSA honor, but I'm more excited to think that our efforts are creating opportunities for students in our communities," said McCarrick.<br>
  <br>
  Summer Session also took fourth place for catalog design at the WASSA conference, where most member institutions submit their catalogs for critique.
