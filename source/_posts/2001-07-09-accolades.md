#### Karen Ottemann

Assistant professor of environmental toxicology Karen Ottemann has been selected as an Ellison Medical Foundation New Scholar in Global Infectious Disease. The foundation will provide Ottemann with an award of $50,000 per year for a four-year period.   
  
The New Scholars in Global Infectious Disease program is intended to support new investigators of outstanding promise in the basic biological and clinical sciences, who conduct molecular biological research on parasitology and infectious diseases.   
  
Ottemann studies how pathogenic bacteria respond to their environment and infect their hosts. She is interested in the mechanisms used by pathogenic bacteria to sense and respond to their environments, both inside and outside their animal hosts. Current studies in her lab are focused on how the ulcer-causing bacterium _Helicobacter pylori_ uses directed motility, or chemotaxis, to establish infection.  
  
The Ellison Medical Foundation, established and supported by Lawrence J. Ellison, supports two areas of research: aging and global infectious disease. The foundation particularly wishes to stimulate new creative research that might not be funded by traditional sources or that is often underfunded in the United States.
