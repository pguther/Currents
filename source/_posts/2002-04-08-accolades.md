### Special Olympics awards

UCSC's Office of Physical Education, Recreation and Sports (OPERS) has received an appreciation award citing its "Continuing Support of Special Olympics Athletes of Northern California."  
  
The award was presented by Special Olympics Northern California, Monterey Bay Region, on Wednesday, April 4. Student directors Charlene Lo, Jenni Stoutamore, and Lexie Levine also received an appreciation award. The three helped coordinate Special Olympics events on campus.  
  
Kevin Givens, intramural sports coordinator for OPERS, said UCSC's relationship with Special Olympics has been "developing and growing as it goes along." Special Olympics events at UCSC over the years have included basketball, soccer, and track and field. Givens called the awards "completely unexpected."
