His expertise is in the design of very large data-storage systems, including the distribution of data to individual storage devices and methods for identifying data for later searching and retrieval. Applications include, for example, large file systems and text or multimedia databases. He also investigates management and security issues for storage systems attached to networks and the use of emerging or "next-generation" storage technologies. Miller received his Sc.B. degree in computer science magna cum laude from Brown University, and his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in computer science from UC Berkeley. Before joining the UCSC faculty, he was an assistant professor at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County.<br>
