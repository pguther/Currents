**Mara Mather**  
Assistant Professor, Psychology  
  
Mara Mather is a cognitive psychologist who specializes in memory. Her work on memory distortion examines the conditions and factors that lead to memory errors, as well as the reasons people remember and misremember decisions they've made. She also conducts research on memory and aging, exploring how emotions are related to age-related changes in memory processes. Mather joined the faculty in January 2001 after earning her doctorate in cognitive psychology from Princeton University. She earned her bachelor's degree in psychology from Stanford University.
