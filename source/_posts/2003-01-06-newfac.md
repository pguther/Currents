New Faculty

Julia Aguirre  
Acting Assistant Professor of Education

Julia Aguirre's research interests focus on mathematics teaching and learning with an emphasis on teacher cognition, school organization and culture, mathematics literacy, and equity issues in mathematics education reform. She earned a B.A. in psychology from UC Berkeley, a master's degree in education from the University of Chicago, and a doctorate in education, cognition, and development from UC Berkeley.

Jason Prochaska  
Assistant Professor of Astronomy and Astrophysics  

Jason X. Prochaska studies quasar absorption line systems and galaxy formation in the early universe. His research investigates theories of nucleosynthesis (the creation of chemical elements in stars) and the dynamics and star-formation history of young galaxies. Prochaska's interests also include searching for the "missing matter" in the local universe and studying chemical abundances in stars within the Milky Way. He earned a B.S. in physics from Princeton University and M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in physics from UC San Diego. Before joining the UCSC faculty, Prochaska was a postdoctoral fellow at the Carnegie Observatories in Pasadena.
