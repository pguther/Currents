  UCSC's financially needy students will have a perpetual source of help, thanks to the generosity of donors to UCSC's Alumni Association.
</p>In June, the <a href="http://alumni.ucsc.edu">Alumni Association</a> met its goal of assembling a $1 million endowment for its Alumni Association Scholarship Fund (AASF). The endowment will ensure that the Alumni Association will always be able to support financially needy UCSC undergraduates, easing the burden of their college expenses and helping the campus attract and retain students who otherwise might be dissuaded from getting a college degree.
<p>
  In 2000-01,the fund will award $2,500 scholarships to a dozen financially needy students. Nearly 70 students have received a total of $146,000 in scholarships since the fund began nearly a decade ago.
</p>
<p>
  Alumni and friends of the campus celebrated the $1 million endowment at the annual Alumni Vintners Wine Tasting late last month. A special dinner at University House for past and present members of the Alumni Council capped the event.
