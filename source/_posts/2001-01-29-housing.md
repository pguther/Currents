  UC Santa Cruz and the owners of the Santa Cruz Holiday Inn (Ramco Illinois, Inc.) have reached an agreement for the campus to lease the entire property on Ocean Street. The agreement, announced January 26, will provide housing for 250 students, as well as short-term accommodations for faculty, staff, and campus visitors.
</p>
<p>
  The university currently leases 83 bed spaces (53 rooms) at the Holiday Inn, and the new agreement will increase by 167 the number of students accommodated there.
</p>
<p>
  UCSC will lease all 172 rooms at the motel for a 10-year period, beginning this September.
</p>
<p>
  The campus plans to use 148 of the 172 rooms to house undergraduate (non-freshmen) and graduate students. The remaining rooms will be used as short-term housing for faculty, staff, guests of the campus, and support staff.
</p>
<p>
  The university plans to honor the motel's contract with the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees union.<br>
