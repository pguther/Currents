  <a name="food" id="food"></a>UCSC honored for food drive efforts<br>
</p>
<p>
  UC Santa Cruz has received the Platinum Can Award for its efforts in the fall 2002 Second Harvest Food Drive. UCSC's total was 45,334 pounds. (Contributors are credited with three pounds of food for every dollar donated.)<br>
</p>
<p>
  In addition to the campuswide contributions of canned goods and cash, 1,026 students participated in the "Hunger Fast," raising $4,423. These students opted to donate the cost of two meals in the residence halls on November 22. A check from Sodexho Services, which operates UCSC dining services, was presented to the Food Bank.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "It was wonderful working with a group of such enthusiastic and committed students who, aside from the many demands of college life, put in numerous hours in an effort to make a difference in the life of someone less fortunate," said Danny Ambrose, cochair with Charlene Lo of the Hunger Fast project.<br>
  <br>
  The Hunger Fast has been done before, but this was the first year for a "PB&amp;J party" at Quarry Plaza for students unable to go off campus for meals that day. Sodexho donated the bread and the Student Volunteer Connection purchased the peanut butter and jelly.<br>

  <a name="work" id="work"></a>Staff psychologist presents her work with students to APA national conference
</p>
<p>
  Marta Elena Corona, a staff psychologist at UCSC, presented a one-hour discussion during the recent <a href="http://www.multiculturalsummit.org">National Multicultural Conference and Summit</a> (NMCS) of the American Psychological Association. The event, which takes place every two years, focused this year on "The Psychology of Race/Ethnicity, Gender, Sexual Orientation, and Disability: Celebrating Our Children, Families, and Seniors."<br>
</p>
<p>
  The conference brings together leading psychologists to address issues related to research, education and training, practice, and public interest issues. Participants have experience in the areas of race relations and ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, and disability.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Offered for the third time this year, the NMCS drew more than 1,000 participants. Corona's presentation, "Cultural Identity Development: A Group Designed for Chicano-Latino University Students," was based on work she conducted at UCSC through <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/counsel">Counseling and Psychological Services</a> (CPS), where Corona runs small cultural-identity groups for Chicana-Latina students.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Group participants explore identity development theory and discuss how being bicultural or multicultural influences their experiences, including college issues such as choice of major, academic success, and career planning, as well as social and family relationships.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "We integrate experiential cultural awareness exercises and questionnaires, share stories, art, poems about cultural identity, and celebrate Chicana-Latinas throughout the world," said Corona. "This is not a group where you are asked to do homework. The goal is to offer a relaxed, fun, and safe learning environment. It also serves as a general support group for Chicana-Latina students."<br>
</p>
<p>
  The groups have been so successful that CPS is now developing a group for Chicano-Latino male students that will be facilitated by Max Camarillo, director of CPS.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Corona is the psychological counselor at Stevenson College. She joined the staff of Counseling and Psychological Services in the fall of 2001. She extended a special thanks to the UCSC community and to her CPS colleagues for their support of her work and is grateful to the students who have made the work successful.

  <a name="agroecology" id="agroecology"></a>Stephen Gliessman gives keynote speech at agroecology conference in Mexico
</p>
<p>
  Environmental studies professor Stephen Gliessman, apioneer of agroecology, recently celebrated two milestones that reveal the maturity of sustainable agriculture and its spread in Mexico and Latin America.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Gliessman was a keynote speaker at the second International Symposium on Sustainable Rural Development in Tropical Regions, held last November in Villahermosa, Tabasco, Mexico. Symposium participants gathered to review the concepts and practice of sustainable development.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Gliessman's address, "Making the Conversion to Sustainable Agriculture," focused on the need to connect the ecological, social, and economic aspects of sustainable agriculture. Gliessman discussed the ways in which traditional and indigenous farming systems in the tropics evolve and reflect the people and their environment. "There are multiple ways to make the conversion from conventional to sustainable practices," said Gliessman, who believes direct links between producers and consumers will play a critical role in facilitating the conversion.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Surrounded by friends and colleagues at the symposium, Gliessman was pleased to celebrate the formal release of the Spanish version of his agroecology textbook, <i>Agroecology: Ecological Processes in Sustainable Agriculture.</i> Presentations were made by officials from the state of Tabasco, as well as the founding director and alumni of the Superior College of Tropical Agriculture. All agreed that the Spanish edition will greatly advance the goals of agroecology.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The state of Tabasco supported the translation and printing of the Spanish edition, which was published in July 2002 at the Center for Tropical Agricultural Research and Education (CATIE) in Turrialba, Costa Rica.

  <a name="suit" id="suit"></a>UC files suit against WorldCom in California state court
</p>
<p>
  The University of California filed a complaint on February 13 on its behalf under California securities fraud law in California Superior Court against Salomon Smith Barney, Citigroup Inc., and Arthur Andersen LLP, accusing them of being involved in the staggering financial collapse of WorldCom Inc. The complaint was announced in a <a href="http://www.ucop.edu/news/archives/2003/feb13art1.htm">press release</a> issued by the Office of the President February 13.
</p>
<p>
  Filed in San Francisco, the complaint alleges that WorldCom, with the complicity of the defendants, engaged in a massive accounting fraud that inflated the price of its stock, damaging shareholders such as the university.
</p>
<p>
  UC's losses totaled in excess of $353 million, based on 10.2 million shares of WorldCom and related securities purchased between 1998 and early 2000. In addition to its stock losses, UC will also seek punitive damages against at least some defendants.
</p>
<p>
  A copy of the complaint is available in pdf at <a href="http://www.ucop.edu/news/worldcom/complaint.pdf">www.ucop.edu/news/worldcom/complaint.pdf</a>.<br>
