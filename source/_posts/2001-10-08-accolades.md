**Robert Irion**

Robert Irion, lecturer in the Science Communication Program, has received the 2001 American Institute of Physics Science Writing Award for his book, _One Universe: At Home in the Cosmos_ (Joseph Henry Press, 2000). He shares the award with his coauthors, astrophysicists Neil deGrasse Tyson and Charles Liu of the American Museum of Natural History in New York. The authors were recognized in the scientists' category; a separate award was given for journalists.

The annual award recognizes the best books and magazine articles in astronomy and physics for a lay audience._ One Universe_ is a coffee-table volume on the unity of physical laws on Earth and throughout the cosmos. The authors will travel to Rochester, New York, for an award ceremony on October 22 at the annual meeting of the American Institute of Physics. They will divide a $3,000 prize, and each will receive an engraved Windsor chair.
