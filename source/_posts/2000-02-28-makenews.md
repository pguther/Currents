**David Cope**'s Experiments in Musical Intelligence was the subject of a story on CNET about recently developed computer programs that can be used to make music. Cope was also featured in a segment on ABC's _World News Now._ The two-minute segment used a short clip from a film by Porter academic preceptor **Bob Giges** on Cope titled _Bach Lives!...At David Cope's House._ Because the film was used, UCSC conductor **Nicole Paiement** also made a cameo on the air. **  
  
**Anthropologist **Nancy Chen**'s expertise in qigong and Falun Gong is well known among journalists, the most recent of whom talked with her while reporting an article for the _New York Times_ about cancer patients in China who are trying to harness the invisible forces of qigong to fight their disease.

**Brent Haddad** of environmental studies is fielding calls about his new book on water policy. He was interviewed by a reporter with American News Service and appeared on KSCO Radio. Next up is KUSP Radio, where he'll appear on March 27 at 12:30 p.m.

Last week's vote on mandatory grades attracted coverage from the local media, including the _Santa Cruz County Sentinel _and KCBA-TV, as well as beyond the local area. The _San Francisco Chronicle_ joined the _San Jose Mercury News_ in covering the story, and both papers quoted several faculty members and instructors, including **Bob Ludwig**, **George Brown**, **Geoffrey Pullum**, **Dan Linger**, **Barbara Rogoff**, **Tim Fitzmaurice**, **Peter Euben**, and **Martha Zuniga**. KQED Radio's coverage included interviews with **Daniel Press**, **Barry Bowman**, and **Roger Anderson**.

In a _Metro Santa Cruz_ story on UCSC alum Marti Noxon, women's studies scholar **Bettina Aptheker** was credited as being the inspiration for an episode of _Buffy the Vampire Slayer,_ the WB channel show about a teenager who fights forces of darkness in the halls of her high school by day and in the vampire world by night. Aptheker herself isn't a vampire expert, but she does know a lot about goddesses, and Noxon, who writes for the hit show, said themes in an episode called "The Wish" were inspired by Aptheker's class lectures on goddesses.   
  
The intensive news coverage of the discovery by astronomer **Anthony Misch** of a manuscript by Johannes Kepler persisted when _National Geographic_ magazine ran a half-page story in its January 2000 issue.
