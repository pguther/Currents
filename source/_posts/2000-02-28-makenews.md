  <b>David Cope</b>'s Experiments in Musical Intelligence was the subject of a story on CNET about recently developed computer programs that can be used to make music. Cope was also featured in a segment on ABC's <i>World News Now.</i> The two-minute segment used a short clip from a film by Porter academic preceptor <b>Bob Giges</b> on Cope titled <i>Bach Lives!...At David Cope's House.</i> Because the film was used, UCSC conductor <b>Nicole Paiement</b> also made a cameo on the air. <b><br>
  <br></b>Anthropologist <b>Nancy Chen</b>'s expertise in qigong and Falun Gong is well known among journalists, the most recent of whom talked with her while reporting an article for the <i>New York Times</i> about cancer patients in China who are trying to harness the invisible forces of qigong to fight their disease.

  In a <i>Metro Santa Cruz</i> story on UCSC alum Marti Noxon, women's studies scholar <b>Bettina Aptheker</b> was credited as being the inspiration for an episode of <i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer,</i> the WB channel show about a teenager who fights forces of darkness in the halls of her high school by day and in the vampire world by night. Aptheker herself isn't a vampire expert, but she does know a lot about goddesses, and Noxon, who writes for the hit show, said themes in an episode called "The Wish" were inspired by Aptheker's class lectures on goddesses.<br>
