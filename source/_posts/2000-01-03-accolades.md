  <font color="#003399">Friends of Long Marine Laboratory Student Research Awards</font>
</h4>
<p>
  The research projects of 23 undergraduate and graduate students received support this year from the Friends of Long Marine Laboratory Student Research Awards. The awards, totaling $8,900, support research projects conducted at Long Marine Laboratory or directed towards the understanding of some aspect of the Monterey Bay.<br>
  <br>
  The Friends of Long Marine Lab Awards come from the interest generated by five different endowments: The Jane McHenry Endowment, the Lillian McPherson Rouse Endowment, the William Baye Heald Scholarship, the Friends of LML Endowment, and the Mark T. MacMillan Award, which is specifically set aside for research in marine biology.<br>
  <br>
