If you've ever wanted to get a quick look at what UCSC's graduate students are up to in their diverse fields, the Graduate Research Symposium is the place to go.

On Friday, May 5, from 3 to 5 p.m., the University Center will come alive with brief oral, computer, and poster presentations on a range of subjects including ancient Egyptian linguistics, dark matter, Aristophanes, mental fatigue analysis, and issues related to media images of women athletes.

"This event is a very exciting way to recognize and celebrate the variety of research that our talented graduate students are engaged in," said vice provost and dean of graduate studies Lisa Sloan. "The breadth and depth of research topics that graduate students will share with the community are outstanding, and I hope that everyone will turn out to learn about these projects."

More than 100 graduate students plan to showcase their work at the event. Cash prizes will be awarded to the top participants in each academic division.

Now in its second year, the event was such a success last year that it overflowed its quarters in the Graduate Commons, prompting the move to the University Center.

"I was impressed by the array of top-notch graduate research displayed at last year's symposium and am looking forward to taking part in the even more wide-ranging symposium planned for this year," said Chancellor Denice D. Denton. "Increasing opportunities for graduate education at UCSC is one of our major priorities, and this symposium is a great reminder of the ways graduate students benefit the entire campus."

The symposium is designed to recognize and promote the outstanding and diverse research being carried out by graduate students from all disciplines.

It is also an opportunity for graduate students to gather as part of the larger UCSC graduate community and to become better acquainted with the scope of research campuswide. The structure of the event--in which a chemistry poster and a sociology poster could be displayed side by side--promotes such awareness.

Participants in last year's symposium were enthusiastic about sharing their research with the campus as a whole and the opportunity to meet graduate students in other disciplines.
