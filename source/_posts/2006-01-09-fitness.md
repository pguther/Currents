  Students, staff, and faculty eager to shed some holiday pounds have a friend in the <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/opers/wellness/">Wellness Center</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Under the exercise buddy program, a current exerciser "adopts" a friend or coworker to help him or her establish a more active lifestyle.
</p>
<p>
  "Adoptees" may attend the Fitness Center at no charge during the promotion if their buddies have Wellness Center cards. The program begins January 17 and ends March 12. Last year, more than 400 members of the campus community participated.
</p>
<p>
  Expanding on last year's promotion, participants in 2006 will also be asked to increase the fresh fruits and vegetables they eat. Dining services will help out by promoting the program within the dining halls, and coordinators for residential education will promote it within the colleges. The Wellness Center is also working with Student Health Outreach &amp; Promotion--also known as SHOP--to publicize the program.
</p>
<p>
  Additional program details and sign-up information is available <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/opers/wellness/adoptaslugsignup2006.htm">online</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The walking map includes times and distances between many campus buildings and landmarks. The aim is to show individuals that much of the campus is easily walked and that many of the distances are not that far. Users can look at the map and determine how long it would take to walk rather than wait for the shuttle or try to drive and find parking.
</p>
<p>
  The map is available <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/opers/wellness/OPERSmap%20legal%20size%20final.pdf">online</a> at the OPERS web site, with an even larger version to be added within the next week to the main campus map web site, <a href="http://maps.ucsc.edu/">http://maps.ucsc.edu/</a>.
