Stepped-up enforcement resulted in 134 seat-belt violation citations being written May 16-June 5, campus police reported.

UCSC's officers joined local and state police in the nationwide "Click it or Ticket" campaign administered by the National Highway Traffic Safety campaign.

Surveys were conducted before and after the enhanced enforcement to gauge the impact of the effort. The first survey, conducted on May 11, showed a 92 percent seat belt usage rate, police said. After the campaign, a June 8 survey showed seat belt usage by drivers had risen to 98 percent, police said.

Two UCSC police officers, Tony Contreras and Steve Garcia, were nominated for California Office of Traffic Safety awards for their outstanding efforts during the campaign.
