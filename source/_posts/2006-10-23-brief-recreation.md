Meetings can be run smoothly and efficiently if everyone feels heard and validated. This workshop, combining the tools of Nonviolent Communication (NVC) with consensus decision making, will help you in creating agendas, decision making, guiding groups through controversy, and incorporating diverse opinions. Instructor Christine King is a certified trainer with the international Center for Nonviolent Communication and holds a graduate degree from the Graduate Institute of International Studies.
