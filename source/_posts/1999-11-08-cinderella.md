For the third year in a row, Shakespeare Santa Cruz invites audiences to launch the holiday season with a festive family-oriented theater experience. This year the critically acclaimed theater company presents an original adaptation of the fairy tale classic, <i>Cinderella.</i>
<p>
  This original version is written by local playwright and Shakespeare Santa Cruz (SSC) veteran actress Kate Hawley.
</p>
<p>
  Hawley has written Cinderella in the British pantomime tradition. Anything but silent, British pantomimes are a form of popular musical traditionally staged at Christmastime in England. The productions are based on traditional fairy tales and feature songs, comedy, and stock characters.
</p>
<p>
  At the heart of "pantos" is a comic character known as "the Dame" (in this case, Cinderella's stepmother, Mrs. Baden-Rotten). Irascible, irrepressible, vulgar, and vain, the Dame is always played by a male comedian. Pantos also feature a good fairy (in this case, Cinderella's godmother) and often a "skin part"--an actor dressed as an animal (for this production a dancing bear will fill the role). And, of course, no pantos is complete without a principal boy and a principal girl.<br>
  Several other stock characters will be featured in SSC's <i>Cinderella:</i> Buttons, Cinderella's loyal friend (who enjoys chatting with the audience); Baron Hardup, Cinderella's irresponsible father; Dandini, the Prince's confidant; and the cruel stepsisters.
</p>
<p>
  As in all SSC productions, <i>Cinderella's</i> cast features a mix of professional, local, and UCSC student actors. An original score has been composed for <i>Cinderella.</i> The score is written by longtime SSC composer Gregg Coffin (who also wrote the score for <i>Wind in the Willows</i> and for several SSC summer productions). <i>Cinderella</i> is directed by award-winning Shakespeare Santa Cruz Artistic Director Paul Whitworth.
</p>
<p>
  <i>Cinderella</i> runs from Saturday, November 27, through Sunday, December 12. To receive a brochure contact the UCSC Ticket Office at (831) 459-2159 or visit the SSC Web page at: <a href="http://shakespearesantacruz.org/welcome.shtml">http://shakespearesantacruz.org/welcome.shtml</a>.
