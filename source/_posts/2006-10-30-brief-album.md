  When he's not teaching in the Latin American and Latino studies program, Greg Landau is producing music. Most recently, he produced the debut album for Peruvian artist Pamela, who has been nominated for a 2006 Latin Grammy Award in the "Best New Artist" category.

  Administered by the Miami-based Latin Academy of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences, Inc., the Latin Grammies recognize artistic and technical achievement, not sales figures or chart positions. Winners are determined by the votes of qualified international members of the Latin Recording Academy. The seventh annual Latin Grammy Awards show will be broadcast Nov. 2.

  Pamela asked Landau to produce her debut album, <i>Pamela: Peru Blue,</i> after hearing his work on Susana Baca's groundbreaking debut record, which sparked broad interest in Afro-Peruvian music outside of Peru. Pamela's CD was mixed by Greg Landau and engineer John Greenham.

  Landau brings a deep understanding of world music, particularly Latin American music, to his work as a producer. Landau has produced more than 30 CDs; Pamela's is the third album he produced that has been nominated for a Latin Grammy. Landau has worked with numerous top artists, including Patato Valdes, Quetzal, Bobi Cespedes, Pete Seeger, and Juan de Marcos Gonzalez of the Buena Vista Social Club.
