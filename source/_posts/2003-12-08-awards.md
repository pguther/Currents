Men's soccer team finishes 'best in the west' with 21-2 record

![][1]

The [UCSC men's soccer team,][2] coached by Paul Holocher (far left), had its best season ever, finishing as the best team in the West Region of the NCAA Division III, with a 21-2-0 record and a No. 5 NCAA Division III ranking in the final [National Soccer Coaches Association of America/Adidas][3] poll.

In the NCAA Tournament, the Slugs defeated the Linfield (Ore.) Wildcats on November 15 by a score of 2-1 in the West Regional Semifinals. (Linfield accounted for the Slug's only regular-season loss.) UCSC went on to defeat host University of Redlands 1-0 on November 16 in the West Regional Final (see [article][4]). The game's lone goal was scored late in the second-half on a soggy field by senior Kevin Anderson on a pass from sophomore Bryan Baird.  
  
The season ended for the Slugs on November 23 when they were defeated 3-0 by the Trinity (Texas) Tigers in the NCAA Division III Quarterfinals in San Antonio.
