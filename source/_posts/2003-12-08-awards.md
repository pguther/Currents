  The <a href="http://goslugs.com/teams/soccer/men/msoc.html">UCSC men's soccer team,</a> coached by Paul Holocher (far left), had its best season ever, finishing as the best team in the West Region of the NCAA Division III, with a 21-2-0 record and a No. 5 NCAA Division III ranking in the final <a href="http://www.nscaa.com/rank/20031201/D3M/0/index.html">National Soccer Coaches Association of America/Adidas</a> poll.
</p>
<p>
  In the NCAA Tournament, the Slugs defeated the Linfield (Ore.) Wildcats on November 15 by a score of 2-1 in the West Regional Semifinals. (Linfield accounted for the Slug's only regular-season loss.) UCSC went on to defeat host University of Redlands 1-0 on November 16 in the West Regional Final (see <a href="http://www.ncaasports.com/soccer/mens/results/2657">article</a>). The game's lone goal was scored late in the second-half on a soggy field by senior Kevin Anderson on a pass from sophomore Bryan Baird.<br>
  <br>
  The season ended for the Slugs on November 23 when they were defeated 3-0 by the Trinity (Texas) Tigers in the NCAA Division III Quarterfinals in San Antonio.
