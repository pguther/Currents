### BAS looking for feedback from customers

Business and Administrative Services (BAS) is launching its second biennial customer satisfaction survey this week. As with its first survey in 1999, BAS is asking faculty and staff for feedback on the interactions they've had with any and all BAS units and subunits in the past 12 months. The survey will run for two weeks, closing at 5 p.m. on Friday, December 14.  
  
BAS is using a web-based survey this year, and it is divided up into five "mini" surveys, each made up of two or more BAS units:

* Financial Affairs and Computing and Technology Services (CATS)
* Materiel Management and Imaging, Printing, Mail and Temporary Services (IPMTS)
* Physical Plant and Physical Planning and Construction (PP& C)
* Police, Fire, Environmental Health and Safety (EH&S) and Transportation and Parking Services (TAPS)
* Staff Human Resources, Internal Audit, and Office of Planning and Analysis (OPA)

To participate in the survey, go to the [BAS Performance Measurement web site][1] and click on "Customer Satisfaction" to start the process. (The results of the 1999 customer satisfaction survey, as well as a list of changes made as a result of that survey, can also be found there.) Initial analysis of the survey results will be available at the Customer Satisfaction web site in mid-January. For more information, contact Susan Willats, manager of management initiatives, at (831) 459-3759 or willats@cats.ucsc.edu.
