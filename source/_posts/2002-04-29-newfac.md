**Huibin Yan  
**Assistant Professor, Economics  
  
Huibin Yan studies bargaining using the tool of noncooperative game theory, which is the formal theory of strategic behavior. Her work focuses on the theoretical aspects of bargaining, and her dissertation showed that a model of multilateral bargaining predicted unique outcomes under general conditions. Her current challenge is to develop a theory of multilateral bargaining in which all parties have an incentive to adopt tough postures. Potential applications of Yan's work include international peace talks and negotiations over trade and the environment. Yan earned her undergraduate degree in economics from Wuhan University in China and her Ph.D. in economics from Washington University in St. Louis.
