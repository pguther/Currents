<p>
  Shakespeare Santa Cruz kicks off a summer season filled with live performances, lectures, backstage tours, and other special events this week.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Getting things started is the popular "Noon at the Nick" series on July 16, and continuing on Fridays though August 6 at Santa Cruz's Nickelodeon Theater.
</p>
<p>
  The free series features discussions with festival directors, actors, and designers.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The Shakespeare Santa Cruz Festival is offering four contrasting comedies this summer: William Shakespeare's <i>The Taming of the Shrew; The Tamer Tamed</i> by Shakespeare's contemporary and collaborator, John Fletcher; Edward Albee's acerbic <i>Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?;</i> and fringe performances of <i>Lysistrata</i> by Aristophanes.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The first performance, a preview of <i>The Taming of the Shrew,</i> will be at 2 p.m. on Wednesday, July 21, in the Festival Glen. A discussion at 6:45 p.m. will precede the July 22 preview. The festival's opening gala will be on Saturday, July 24, opening night for <i>The Taming of the Shrew.</i><br>
