Shakespeare Santa Cruz kicks off a summer season filled with live performances, lectures, backstage tours, and other special events this week.   

Getting things started is the popular "Noon at the Nick" series on July 16, and continuing on Fridays though August 6 at Santa Cruz's Nickelodeon Theater.

The free series features discussions with festival directors, actors, and designers.  

The Shakespeare Santa Cruz Festival is offering four contrasting comedies this summer: William Shakespeare's _The Taming of the Shrew; The Tamer Tamed_ by Shakespeare's contemporary and collaborator, John Fletcher; Edward Albee's acerbic _Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?;_ and fringe performances of _Lysistrata_ by Aristophanes.  

The first performance, a preview of _The Taming of the Shrew,_ will be at 2 p.m. on Wednesday, July 21, in the Festival Glen. A discussion at 6:45 p.m. will precede the July 22 preview. The festival's opening gala will be on Saturday, July 24, opening night for _The Taming of the Shrew._   

Detailed event schedules and online ticket purchasing are available at the [Shakspeare Santa Cruz web site][1].

Other special events include:  

* Free Saturday backstage tours, August 7-28, 11 a.m. Call (831) 459-5810 for reservations.
* Family Sunday Matinees, August 8-29. For every one adult ticket, buyers may purchase two youth tickets (ages 5-18) for $10 each (discounted).
* Weekend with Shakespeare, August 13-15, offers an in-depth look at the plays and playwrights.

**Women at Work Retreat discounts**  

The Women at Work Retreat is again this year sponsoring lower-priced group tickets for staff and faculty for Shakespeare Santa Cruz plays. The group rate is available for three Friday evening performances, at a cost of $22 per ticket.  

The reduced-price tickets are available for the following performances:
