A 15-part BBC television series called "California Bay," focusing on marine life and research around Monterey Bay, featured several UCSC marine scientists, including biologists **Terrie Williams** and **Baldo Marinovic,** geologist **Gary Griggs,** head dolphin trainer **Billy Hurley,** and many of the student volunteers who help care for resident dolphins **Primo** and **Puka** at Long Marine Laboratory.  
  
The _Santa Cruz County Sentinel_ ran a story about astrophysicist **Stan Woosley's** theory regarding the origins of gamma ray bursts.  
  
Earth sciences researcher **Erik Asphaug's** research on asteroid impacts was included in an article about asteroids in the _New York Times._  
  
The work of associate professor of mathematics **Richard Montgomery** was featured in the magazines _Science News_ and _Science._ Montgomery's novel solution of the "three-body problem"--the 300-year-old conundrum of understanding how three planets or stars move under each other's mutual gravitational attraction--showed that the orbits of a trio of stars bound by gravity could trace a figure-eight pattern through space.

Athletic director **Mark Majeski** was quoted in a _Santa Cruz County Sentinel_ article about the triumph of the Banana Slug nickname over all other competitors--including the South Dakota School of Mines "Hardrockers"--in the [SportsUniversity.com][1] National Funniest Nickname Championship.
