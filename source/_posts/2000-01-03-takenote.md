#### Constantine Panunzio Distinguished Emeriti Award

The campus community is invited to submit nominations for the Constantine Panunzio Distinguished Emeriti Award. The award acknowledges outstanding work or service performed by a UC emeritus or emerita in any year after retirement. Nominations should describe the work or service to be recognized and include supporting information, such as a critique of the work or the candidate's curriculum vitae and a copy of a published work. One nomination from UCSC will be chosen by a small committee headed by Joseph Bunnett, professor emeritus of chemistry. Nominations should be sent to Professor Bunnett, Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, by January 10.

**Editorial style guide on the Web**

[A Guide to Editorial Style][2] at the University of California, Santa Cruz, is posted on the Web. The editorial style guide is useful to all campus units preparing printed or online communications. It establishes a consistent editorial style for the campus and answers some frequently asked questions about general editorial usage and style. A list of further reference sources is appended. If you have questions, contact lance@cats.ucsc.edu.
