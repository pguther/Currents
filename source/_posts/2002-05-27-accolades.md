</h3>
<p>
  Harry Berger Jr., professor emeritus of literature and art history, has been named one of Phi Beta Kappa's Visiting Scholars for the 2002-03 year.
</p>
<p>
  In 1956, Phi Beta Kappa established the Visiting Scholar Program to enable chapters to bring distinguished scholars to their campuses. Each year 12 or more scholars are invited to undertake a series of visits to Phi Beta Kappa institutions taking part in the program. The visiting scholar spends two days at each of the institutions he or she visits, participating in classroom lectures and seminars, meeting informally with faculty and student groups, and giving at least one address open to the entire academic community.
</p>
<p>
  In addition, Berger has accepted Smith College's invitation to visit this fall as Kennedy Professor in Renaissance Studies.<br>
