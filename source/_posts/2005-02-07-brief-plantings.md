Volunteers are needed on two Saturdays in February to help preserve UCSC's natural environment.

A native plant revegetation/planting day has been organized for February 12 at Younger Lagoon Reserve, part of the UCSC Natural Reserves system. Volunteers will be planting a variety of native species to support habitat restoration efforts and have the opportunity to learn about native plant and animal communities and their invasive competitors.

Volunteers will meet at the Barn Theater at the main campus entrance at 10 a.m. to carpool to Younger Lagoon and should bring water and lunch. The workday will last until 2 p.m. To find out more or RSVP, e-mail [mcstay@ucsc.edu][1] or check the [Natural Reserves][2] web site.

On February 26, a site stewardship field day in the Long Marine Lab area will include interplanting and maintenance of earlier native plantings and removing exotic invasive species.

Volunteers should meet at the patio in front of the Center for Ocean Health at Long Marine Lab at 10 a.m. to work until 2 p.m. or arrange to take the carpool from the Upper Quarry Bookstore Plaza. To find out more or RSVP, e-mail [grounds_interns@ucsc.edu][3], or check the [Site Stewardship][4] web site.  

Both work projects will be canceled only in case of hard rain.
