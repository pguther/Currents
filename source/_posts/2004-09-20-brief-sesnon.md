The photos of Doug Hall will be on display at the Mary Porter Sesnon Gallery September 28 through November 13. Hall is one of the leading practitioners of large-scale color photography in America. Based in San Francisco, he travels the globe capturing images of industrial and post-industrial society. The exhibit, titled _In Finite Spaces,_ explores the theme of the modern city and features images from Brazil, Vietnam, Italy, Japan, and the United States.

There will be an artist talk on September 28 at 5 p.m. in the Baskin Seminar Room D-101, followed by an opening reception at 6 p.m. at the Sesnon Gallery.

On September 29, Philip Brookman, senior curator of photography and media arts at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., and former director of the Sesnon Art Gallery, will give a talk on contemporary photography at 7 p.m. at the Sesnon Gallery. The talk is free and open to the public.  
  
The Sesnon Art Gallery, located at Porter College, is open Tuesday through Saturday from noon to 5 p.m. The gallery is wheelchair accessible and admission is free. For more information, visit the gallery web site at <http://arts.ucsc.edu/sesnon>.
