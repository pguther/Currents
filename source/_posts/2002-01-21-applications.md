<p>
  Undergraduate applications to UCSC for fall 2002 increased 6 percent among freshman applicants and 5.3 percent among transfer students compared with the totals received last year. A total of 24,275 prospective students applied by the November deadline for admission to UCSC.
</p>The UCSC increases are in sync with systemwide increases reported last week by the UC Office of the President.<br>
<br>
A total of 20,117 prospective freshmen and 4,158 transfer students applied to UCSC during the traditional November filing period. These are the applicants who are interested in enrolling next September for the fall 2002 quarter.<br>
<br>
Among the UCSC highlights was an 11.1 percent increase in freshman applications from Asian American students compared with the applications received at this time last year--the highest increase reported by any UC campus. Interest in UCSC among California's many other ethnic groups also grew. The campus saw a 3.5 percent increase in applications from African Americans; a 6.2 percent increase among Chicanos; a 4.9 percent increase among Filipino Americans; and a 3.8 percent increase among Latinos. Freshman applications from "White/Other Students" increased 6.5 percent.<br>
<br>
The campus plans to enroll approximately 4,200 new students (freshmen and transfer students) this September.<br>
<br>
The next step in the undergraduate admissions cycle is to notify students of admission, which takes place beginning March 1. On April 20, the campus holds its annual open house, Banana Slug Spring Fair, to help admitted students and their families learn more about UCSC. The deadline for freshman admits to notify the university of their plans to enroll as undergraduates is May 1, while the transfer student deadline is June 1.
