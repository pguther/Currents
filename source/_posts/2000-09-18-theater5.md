#### Associate Producing Director/Director, [The Acting Company][1]  
April 12: _O Pioneers!_

The New York-based company is now in its 30th year. The show that will be performed in Santa Cruz is the first in a five-part series conceived by Corley, which entailed commissioning five of the country's most brilliant contemporary playwrights to adapt great American novels for the stage. The play _O Pioneers!_ was adapted by Darrah Cloud from the novel by Willa Cather, with music by Kim D. Sherman. It appeared originally on PBS' _American Playhouse._

"Brecht said that theater should always be, more than anything, fun. If it wasn't fun, fundamentally, it wasn't worth doing. He was reacting against the very stodgy theater of the 19th century. It's ironic that the idea of musicals, which we think of as fluffy entertainment, was a concept that appealed to Brecht.  
  
I think theater should also be, fundamentally, a lens for you to look at society through, and to look at yourself. Good theater should incorporate psychology and history.   
  
There is something Kafka said about art being the ax that breaks up the frozen ocean inside of us. I always like that quote. Art should challenge us to think in different ways, and to get a broader perspective on ourselves in the world.   
  
In terms of what we aim to do, the Acting Company has a dual mission. First, we want to support the work of young actors and, second, to take theater to places around the country that don't get an opportunity to see it often. That mission gets at the other thing, aside from entertainment, that I think theater should do: Theater should educate.  
  
That word often has a bad connotation, in that it seems like you're going to be fed ideas. But it comes from educare, from Latin, which is to lead forth, to take someone to another place. That is exactly what good theater should do--take you to another place. We want to take people on a journey."
