![photo of Margaret Dekshenieks][1]Margaret Dekshenieks studies circulation processes in the coastal ocean. She is particularly interested in the coupling of physical and biological processes. Dekshenieks uses numerical models to calculate the effects of physical changes in the marine environment on marine organisms. She also develops instruments and related software for collecting and visualizing oceanographic data in real time. Dekshenieks earned a B.A. in environmental sciences from the University of Virginia, an M.S. in biological oceanography from Old Dominion University, and a Ph.D. in physical oceanography from the Center for Coastal Physical Oceanography at Old Dominion University. Before joining the UCSC faculty, she spent two years as a postdoctoral researcher and two years as an assistant marine scientist at the University of Rhode Island.

**Eileen Zurbriggen**  
Assistant Professor of Psychology

Eileen Zurbriggen, assistant professor of psychology, studies the effects of childhood sexual abuse on adults, looking particularly at the psychological processes that underlie negative outcomes associated with sexuality. She also studies correlations between sex and power, from mild forms of coercion in dating relationships to overt sexual aggression. Zurbriggen earned her Ph.D. in psychology from the University of Michigan, and she held a one-year postdoctoral appointment at the University of Oregon before coming to UCSC.
