Lack of student voter turnout in the election that ended May 6 thwarted efforts to increase the student transit fee at UCSC.  
  
The measure got strong support, 74.23 percent to 25.77 percent, but 20 percent of students must cast votes in order for a change in student fees to be approved. Undergraduate turnout was 17.71 percent; graduate student turnout was 7.34 percent.  
  
Proponents of the measure said it was needed to expand Metro bus service and continue to improve shuttle service.  
  
Stephen deHaan, elections commissioner for the Student Union Assembly, said he was "disappointed" that turnout did not meet the 20 percent threshold, but attributed the low turnout to the lack of high-interest issues.  
  
Voters in the April 30-May 6 [election][1] approved officers for the Student Union Assembly, the UC Student Association representative, campus office director, and Lobby Corps director. Students also voiced their opinions on a range of issues, from facilities and improvements they would be willing to support with a fee increase to student services.
