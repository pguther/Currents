If you've had a hankering to brush up on the Bard before this year's summer festival, or if you're a wine enthusiast, an aspiring writer, an avid gardener, or a working professional eager to expand your skills set, look no further than the UCSC Extension catalog of summer classes.

"Summer is when people want to take courses that feed their creative side," said Joselyn Ignacio-Zimardi, director of public relations for UCSC Extension. "We have a lot of teachers interested in professional development, but other people want to do travel studies, the bio-eco tours, or take a class in culinary arts."

This summer's offerings include a four-evening class called, Understanding Shakespeare: _Love's Labour's Lost _and_ Cymbeline._ Taught by William Mowatt, a member of the Board of Directors of Shakespeare Santa Cruz, the course will prepare participants to enjoy more fully the two Shakespeare plays being performed during the summer 2000 Shakespeare Santa Cruz festival. The course description promises "stimulating lecture, video clips, discussion, and participation in a nonthreatening environment."

All UCSC faculty, staff, and students receive a 30 percent discount on fees (not to exceed $150 for any single course), added Ignacio-Zimardi.

Other popular courses include numerous writing classes. _The World of Screenwriting_ is hot in this area," noted Ignacio-Zimardi. Chefs might enjoy _Recipe for a Cookbook: How to Write Your Own,_ which is taught by Suzanne Sherman, who has edited cookbooks for Chronicle Books and Ten Speed Press.

Culinary arts classes are popular year-round, and this summer's guest-chef series features Marco Verduzco, owner of the popular Convivio Trattoria in Santa Cruz. Verduzco will teach three separate classes on contemporary California-Italian cuisine at his restaurant.

If all that cooking makes you thirsty, check out the viticulture and wine appreciation section of the catalog, where you'll find classes that include _The Wines of Burgundy,_ _The Wines of the United States,_ and, if you're ambitious, _Basic Home Winemaking_ and _Establishing the Home Vineyard._

In short, there's something for everyone in the UCSC Extension catalog. Visit the web site to see the full offerings [www.ucsc-extension.edu][1].
