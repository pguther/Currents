In Memoriam

Carlos Estrada

Update: The memorial service for Carlos Estrada will take place on Saturday, March 6, at noon, at the Merrill Provost House.

Carlos Alberto Estrada, a freshman from San Diego, died February 16 in an auto accident on Highway 17. He was 19.

Carlos, who was a student at Merrill College, was making plans to study physics (astrophysics).  

Discussions are under way with Carlos's family about a possible memorial event at Merrill in the near future. His family has also requested that, in lieu of flowers, donations in support of scholarships be made to Merrill's general endowment fund.
