She earned her M.F.A. in painting at Yale University in 1989 and has been a visiting artist at Ohio State University (where she had received her B.A. in painting), the Pratt Institute in New York City, and Vassar College in New York. She received a grant from the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts in 2000 and has been reviewed in <i>Artforum, Art News,</i> the <i>New York Times</i>, and the <i>Village Voice.</i> She has exhibited her work in a number of solo and selected group shows in New York, Chicago, and San Francisco. Gwyn came to UCSC from the San Francisco Art Institute, where she taught graduate and undergraduate courses in painting.
