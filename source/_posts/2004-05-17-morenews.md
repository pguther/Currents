Library to hold map sale on May 22

Don't forget the big Map Sale this Saturday, May 22, from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. in the foyer of the Science & Engineering Library. Maps will be individually priced, with many offered for as low as twenty-five cents each. Many will be free.  

Hundreds of maps will be available, including world and foreign maps, road and tourist maps, and other geographical materials. A small selection of local-area California maps will be offered. In addition, a large number of free, superseded USGS topographic maps will be available (mostly western states).  

The maps frame quite nicely. Many of them are printed on acid-free material, making them also ideal for craft projects and wrapping.  

Proceeds from the sale will contribute to the library's funds for new maps. Items will be sold on a "first-come, first served" basis. Materials cannot be previewed prior to sale. There is also no catalog of listing of the items to be sold.

Callers reach million-dollar mark in record time  
  
UCSC's Telephone Outreach callers, student workers who call alumni and parents to raise money for the Annual Fund, have raised more than $1 million--in record time--this year.  

This is the sixth year in a row that the campaign has reached the million-dollar mark, but that level is not usually reached until later in the year. This year that figure was reached April 29. The all-time Telephone Outreach Program high of $1.11 million is expected to be exceeded by the time the program ends in six weeks.

Seymour Center to receive funding from surf industry  

The Seymour Center at Long Marine Laboratory is among the 10 environmental organizations chosen by the Surf Industry Manufacturers Association (SIMA) to receive proceeds from the 2004 Waterman's Weekend, the surf industry's annual environmental fundraiser.   

The SIMA Environmental Fund provides grants to environmental organizations based on their commitment to specific projects that will protect and preserve oceans, beaches, or surf breaks. The Seymour Center will use the funds from SIMA to educate young people about the role marine science plays in understanding and conserving the world's oceans.   

The exact amount of the grant depends on the funds raised during the Waterman's Weekend. Last year, the Seymour Center received $8,000 from the SIMA Environmental Fund.  

The annual Waterman's Weekend serves as the primary fundraiser for the SIMA Environmental Fund through the Waterman's Classic Golf Tournament and Waterman's Ball and Auction. This year's Waterman's Classic will take place August 27 at the Monarch Beach Golf Links. The Waterman's Ball and Auction will be held August 28 at the St. Regis Monarch Bean Resort & Spa in Dana Point, California.
