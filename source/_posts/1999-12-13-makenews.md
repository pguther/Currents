Literature's **Tyrus Miller** was quoted extensively in a story in the _Chronicle of Higher Education_ on how teachers are broadening the canon of modernist writers they use in the classroom. The quotes were drawn from Miller's book, _Late Modernism: Politics, Fiction, and the Arts Between the World Wars_ (UC Press, 1999).

Planetary scientist **Erik Asphaug** was quoted in stories about asteroids and planet formation that ran in the _Dallas Morning News_ and other newspapers. Asphaug wrote a commentary accompanying a research article in the journal _Nature,_ and his colorful language was widely quoted. (The asteroid Mathilde, Asphaug wrote, "looks as though some deity has taken large bites from a cosmic potato.")

When French lecturer **Miriam Ellis** was awarded the rare honor of knighthood from the French government, the news was picked up by local television and newspapers. Covering the story were KSBW-Channel 8, KION-Channel 46; the _Watsonville Register-Pajaronian,_ and the _Santa Cruz County Sentinel._ Ellis received the award, the Palmes Academique, in recognition of her outstanding work in promoting French arts and culture.

Psychology lecturer **Don Saposnek** was quoted in a recent _Washington Post_ article on divorce mediation, discussing the value of utilizing the principles of aikido in conflict resolution and the issues involved in the regulation of mediation nationally.
