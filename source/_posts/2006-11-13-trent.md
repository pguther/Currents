  Jonathan Trent, an adjunct professor of biomolecular engineering, was chosen by <i>Nanotech Briefs</i> magazine to receive a Nano 50 award. The Nano 50 awards recognize the "top 50 technologies, products, and innovators that have significantly impacted, or are expected to impact, the state of the art in nanotechnology."
</p>
<p>
  Trent leads the protein nanotechnology group at NASA Ames Research Center. For many years, he has been studying the molecular adaptations of "extremophiles" (microbes that live in extreme habitats), focusing on a certain class of proteins found in organisms that live in hot sulfuric acid. His group has been manipulating these proteins and exploring potential uses for them.

<p>
  The Nano 50 awards were presented November 9 at a special reception and awards dinner during the National Nano Engineering Conference in Boston.<br>
