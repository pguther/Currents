The head of UCSC's Information Technology Services division introduced the six members of his senior management team on Tuesday (September 21), ushering in the third phase of the campus's "IT transformation."

In a meeting attended by dozens of IT staff members from around the campus, Vice Provost Larry Merkley said Phase III would produce "service agreements" between ITS and UCSC's other academic and administrative divisions and a funding model that would support those agreements.

He also told those in attendance that the movement of IT workers to the central organization would occur on a case-by-case basis. "Our objective is to effect a smooth transition from where we are to where we need to be," he said, adding that--unless notified otherwise--IT workers' positions and reporting relationships remain unchanged for the time being.

The six directors he introduced are:

* **Pat LeCuyer,** of Applications Solutions,
* **Bill Hyder,** of Client Relationship Management,
* **Janine Roeth,** of IT Services,
* **Brad Smith, **of Core Technologies,
* **Mark Cianca,** of the Program Management Office, and
* **Linda Kittle,** of IT Strategy and Planning.

For more information on these positions, please see the following campus email messages:
