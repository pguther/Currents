[Illustrating Nature][1], the annual exhibit of artwork by students in the [UCSC Extension Science Illustration Program][2], is on display at the Santa Cruz Museum of Natural History, 1305 East Cliff Drive, through June 11.

The 67 artworks displayed in this year's exhibit depict everything from mammals to microbes in great detail using media ranging from colored pencil, scratchboard, coquille, watercolor, acrylic, and digital media.

Graduates of the Science Illustration Program go on to illustrate for a variety of prestigious institutions and publications such as the _Smithsonian, National Geographic, Scientific American,_ and the American Museum of Natural History. UCSC is one of the few universities in the U.S. with a specialized program in scientific illustration.  
  
Illustrating Nature is cosponsored by the Museum of Natural History, the Museum Association, the Science Communication Program, and Community Printers.
