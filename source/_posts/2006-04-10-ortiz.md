Paul Ortiz, associate professor of community studies, has received the 2006 Harry T. and Harriette V. Moore Book Prize from the Florida Historical Society for his book _Emancipation Betrayed: The Hidden History of Black Organizing and White Violence in Florida from Reconstruction to the Bloody Election of 1920._

The award will be presented on May 26 at the society's annual meeting in Naples, Florida. Ortiz will receive a $200 stipend and a medal commemorating the award.

Established in 1998, the award is cosponsored by the Florida Historical Society and the Florida Institute of Technology. It recognizes the best overall book or monograph about Florida's ethnic population or a significant social issue from a historical perspective.

The 2006 meeting celebrates the sesquicentennial year of the founding of the society.
