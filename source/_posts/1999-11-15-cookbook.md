Just in time for holiday feasting and gift giving, the Friends of the UCSC Farm & Garden are pleased to announce publication of their second cookbook, _Seasonal Recipes from the Great Chefs of Santa Cruz County._

Featuring 81 recipes from chefs cooking for the area's premiere restaurants and catering companies, the cookbook highlights the use of seasonally fresh produce in everything from appetizers to main dishes and desserts.

As Deborah Madison, founding chef of Greens Restaurant in San Francisco and author of _The Savory Way,_ writes in the introduction to the new cookbook, "starting with good-tasting, startlingly fresh vegetables means that more than half the battle with cooking is won. In fact, cooking ceases to be a battle and becomes the pleasure it should be."  
  
The recipes are presented in four separate seasonal sections, each of which is introduced with a description by UCSC garden manager Orin Martin of the garden during fall, winter, spring, and summer. The cookbook, which is spiral bound and lies flat for easy use, also features original drawings by local artist Graydon Livingston.   
  
The cookbook will be available in local bookstores, Integrand Design, and other outlets in early December. The suggested retail price is $19.95. Proceeds from sales support the work of the Friends of the UCSC Farm & Garden, including community education in organic farming and gardening.   
  
Two events are being held to celebrate the arrival of the new cookbook, which follows publication three years ago of _Recipes from the Great Chefs of Santa Cruz County._
