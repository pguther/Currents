A new campus-community initiative to reduce the consequences of excessive, high-risk drinking and create a safer environment for students and their neighbors is under way.

Called Campus CURB, for Campus and Community United to Reduce Bingeing, the effort is a collaboration among UCSC's Student Health Outreach and Promotion office, other UCSC offices, and members of the community.

This fall, CURB will launch the campaign "Just Say Gnome: Party Small," and work to combat binge drinking on multiple levels, A key effort will be an awareness campaign about the new city ordinance in Santa Cruz targeting out-of-control parties. Tips on hosting parties that do not include excessive drinking will also be widely distributed to students.

The campuswide Good Neighbor Initiative and CURB will combine forces on alcohol-related issues. The student interns of the Good Neighbor Initiative work with students and neighborhood leaders to ease town-gown tensions, and have developed a set of Good Neighbor Guidelines. (See [earlier article][2] in _Currents.)_

Parents of UCSC students are another part of the effort. A letter has been sent out urging them to talk about alcohol and other drug use with their sons and daughters attending UCSC.

Law enforcement agencies both on the campus and in the community will also be enlisted to conduct Drinking Under the Influence checkpoints and other actions.

Additional details on the program will be announced soon, and covered in _Currents Online._
