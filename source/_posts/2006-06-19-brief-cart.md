Fresh organic produce and flowers will be available at the base of campus twice a week beginning Tuesday, June 20.

The Farm & Garden's Market Cart will be open Tuesdays and Fridays, noon to 6 p.m., at the corner of Bay and High Streets.

Early offerings will include tender lettuces, sweet carrots, tasty beets, and chard. As the growing season progresses, look forward to sweet corn, flavorful tomatoes, plums, potatoes, an array of sweet and hot peppers, apples, basil, and more.

While you're picking up vegies for dinner, grab a colorful bouquet of flowers for your home or workplace.

The cart will be open into the fall, depending on the length of the growing season. All proceeds benefit the UCSC Center for Agroecology & Sustainable Food Systems' apprenticeship program in ecological horticulture. For more information, call (831) 459-3240.
