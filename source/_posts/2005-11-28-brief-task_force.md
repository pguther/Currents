  A range of topics--including faculty hiring, retention, and promotion, partner hiring issues, and even the cost of living in Santa Cruz--came up during a diversity task force site visit November 14-15.
</p>
<p>
  The site visit team of UC President Robert C. Dynes's <a href="http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/facultydiversity">Task Force on Diversity</a> met with Chancellor Denice D. Denton, Executive Vice Chancellor David Kliger, the divisional deans, and Graduate Dean Lisa Sloan, UCSC task force representative.
</p>
<p>
  Task force members also met with members of two Academic Senate committees: Affirmative Action and Diversity, and Academic Personnel, as well as with the chair of the Committee on Faculty Welfare. Meetings were also held with Senate Chair Faye Crosby and Vice Chair Quentin Williams, and principal diversity officers Alison Galloway, interim vice provost for academic affairs; Barbara Brogan, assistant vice chancellor; Patricia Hiramoto, Equal Employment Opportunity/Affirmative Action director; and Sandra Chung, linguistics professor.

  The visiting team also met with various faculty of color and others over lunch and met informally with some department chairs as well as the deans.

  "The visit gave us a chance to evaluate where we are doing well and where we need to pay more attention," said Galloway, adding that faculty retention is one area where the campus needs further work. "However, if any university wants a diverse faculty, it must pay attention to the entire life cycle--from getting students to attend university in the first place; go to graduate school; apply for UC jobs; be selected as candidates; be hired, retained, and promoted; and move into leadership positions."
</p>
<p>
  Anyone with questions, concerns, or comments about the task force may contact Sloan at <a href="mailto:lsloan@ucsc.edu">lsloan@ucsc.edu</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The task force's comprehensive review of faculty diversity efforts throughout the UC system includes site visits to each UC campus. A preliminary report is scheduled for release in January, to be followed by a systemwide summit.
