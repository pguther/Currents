  Bay Tree Bookstore staff have been working feverishly to ready their spacious new facility for today's opening. Wearing T-shirts saying "Finally! The Book Store Moves In!," they spent July 5, 6, and 7 unpacking and setting up new displays. (See <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/currents/00-01/06-25/bookstore.html">article</a> on all the features of the new bookstore.)

  <font color="#003399">Staff and faculty mentors sought</font>
</h4>
<p>
  The Page and Eloise Smith Scholastic Society is bringing together UCSC alumni, faculty, and staff to serve the educational aspirations of UCSC students who are foster children, wards of the court, and orphans. There will be over 40 of these students on campus next fall. They will receive scholarships from the Page and Eloise Smith Scholastic Society, but they will also need other help.<br>
  <br>
  Can you help someone through the registration process? Could you correspond occasionally via e-mail with a student needing advice about a major? Perhaps you could help a new student connect with just the right faculty member to explore their visions or goals. If you are interested in any level of mentorship relationship with a current student who has been a foster child, ward of the court, or orphan, please contact Lynn Zachreson in the Alumni Office at ( 831) 459-5842.
