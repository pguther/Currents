  The San Diego Supercomputer Center (SDSC) at UC San Diego offers access to a vast array of computational resources through the Academic Associates Program, which is available to all UC researchers with a need for massive computational power and large storage and archiving space.
</p>
<p>
  The Academic Associates Program (AAP), formerly known as the Block Grant Program, was started in 1995 to give UC researchers free access to large-scale computational and data management resources at the SDSC. Through startup accounts, AAP helps UC researchers learn how to use SDSC resources, paving the way for obtaining larger accounts through SDSC allocations. Any qualified UC researcher can request supercomputing time using the online application form <a href="http://www.sdsc.edu/user_services/aap/user/apply.html">http://www.sdsc.edu/user_services/aap/user/apply.html</a>.
</p>

  For more information, contact the campus AAP administrator, Don Korycansky, at (831) 459-5843 or <a href="mailto:kory@es.ucsc.edu">kory@es.ucsc.edu</a>.
