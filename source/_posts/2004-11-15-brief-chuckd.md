UCSC Arts & Lectures presents rap musician, Internet pioneer, and social activist Chuck D on Thursday, November 18, at 8 p.m. at the Rio Theatre. Chuck D focuses on current events at his speaking engagements, sharing his unique, strong, and insightful perspective on a range of topics with acute intelligence and eloquence.

![][1]Best known as leader and cofounder of the legendary rap group Public Enemy, Chuck D redefined rap music and hip-hop culture with the release of Public Enemy's explosive debut album, _Yo! Bum Rush the Show_, 1987. His messages then, as now, addressed weighty issues about race, rap, rage, reality, and inequality. The group became so popular and well respected that it was included in the _New York Times_ list of the 25 Most Significant Albums of the Last Century. Chuck D also co-hosts the morning show _Unfiltered_ on the recently launched network Air America Radio.
