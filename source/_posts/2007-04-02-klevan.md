Music lecturer Robert Klevan has received the California Music Education Association's (CMEA) 2007 Otter Distributor Jazz Education Award. The award is presented each year to a jazz educator in California to honor "excellence in jazz education and performance."

Now in his ninth year as director of the UCSC Wind Ensemble, Klevan also directs the UCSC Large Jazz Ensemble and teaches an _Introduction to Music Education_ course. After a 27-year career as music director and director of fine arts at the Stevenson School in Pebble Beach, he was appointed as jazz education director for the Monterey Jazz Festival in 2002. Under Klevan's leadership, the educational programs of the Monterey Jazz Festival have steadily grown over the past five years.
