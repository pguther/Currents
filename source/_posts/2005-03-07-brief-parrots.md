Dr. Gino Strada, author of _Green Parrots: A War Surgeon's Diary_ and a cofounder of the humanitarian organization Emergency, will speak and sign his book from 7 to 9 p.m. on Wednesday, March 9, at the Veterans' Memorial Hall, 846 Front Street, Santa Cruz.

![][1]The event is sponsored by Cowell College, the Italian Studies Program, the Language Program, the Institute for Humanities Research, the Literary Guillotine, and the Resource Center for Nonviolence. The suggested donation is $5, but no one will be turned away for lack of funds. The event is open to the public.

The Emergency organization provides medical and surgical assistance and rehabilitation to war victims, particularly to those injured by anti-personnel mines. Strada's book was recently translated into English from the original Italian and has an introduction by American historian Howard Zinn. All proceeds from the sale of Dr. Strada's book will go to support the work of Emergency.
