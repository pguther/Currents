When asked what he would walk away with after his year of serving as the University of California's Student Regent, Justin Fong responded with a succint but revealing answer: "At least half a lifetime's experience."   
  

A UCLA graduate student pursuing a master's degree in public policy, Fong visited the UCSC campus January 25 to promote the Student Regent Program and to encourage other students to apply for the position. Fong's one-year term as Student Regent ends June 30.  
  
The UCSC Career Center is currently holding orientations and application workshops for UCSC students who are interested in applying for the 2002-03 Student Regent position. Fong visited the Career Center, to share his experiences and answer questions from students on campus.  
  
"Being a Student Regent has been fantastic," said Fong. "It is truly dynamic and challenging in every way. Any student in any field has something to gain from an experience like this."  
  
The life of a Regent is extremely busy, and Fong's life was no exception even before he took the position as Student Regent. He has participated in numerous campus and community activities in both northern and southern California, including serving as a board member and cofounder of Bridges, a multicultural recruitment center and informative network to promote higher education for low-income disadvantaged youths more effectively. Fong also served as a volunteer teacher at the Oakland Street Academy, an alternative high school for at-risk youths.  
  
As a full voting member of the Board of Regents, Fong says his schedule is consistently full. Throughout the year, the Board of Regents meets regularly to discuss a wide range of issues affecting the UC system and its 10 campuses. In between board meetings, Fong attends smaller committee meetings, public events, and campus visits--all on top of his course load at UCLA.  
  
"However, I do take a reduced load," said Fong, who received his B.A. in environmental sciences at UC Berkeley. "What you learn as a Student Regent surpasses anything you can get out of a classroom."  
  
According to Fong, having to attend so many meetings can sometimes be a little draining, but as long as he contributes to each and every meeting, Fong knows he is making a difference.  
  
"My favorite part is getting to visit the entire system," said Fong. "I get to go to every campus and speak to students, staff, and faculty there. In the UC system, we have beautiful, large campuses and we have some really nice, small campuses. I have a whole new appreciation of the University of California."
