##### Shakespeare Santa Cruz offers world premiere

After the spectacular response to _Cinderella _for the past two holiday seasons, Shakespeare Santa Cruz is getting into the spirit once again with another world premiere musical: _Gretel & Hansel: A New Twist on an Old Tail_.

Performance dates are Saturday, November 17, through Sunday, December 16, at the UCSC Theater Arts Mainstage.  
  
Audiences will watch Gretel, Hansel, and their ingenious cat Tom outsmart the culinary-minded and the thrillingly wicked Carmen Monoxide and her Crow-Conspirators. Papa, Kitten Caboodle, and The Glamour Pusses add another dimension to this wild ride in the Black Forest.  
  
Joseph Ribeiro (Mrs. Badden-Rotten in _Cinderella_) returns to SSC to create the role of Carmen Monoxide along with Mike Ryan (Buttons in _Cinderella_) who will play Tom.  
  
Once again, Shakespeare Santa Cruz artistic director Paul Whitworth teams up with award-winning playwright Kate Hawley, to transform a classic fairy tale into live theater at its liveliest in the English pantomime tradition. Nationally renowned composer Craig Bohmler (_Enter the Guardsman, Gun Metal Blues_) has joined the team, along with set designer Glynn Bartlett. _Cinderella_'s design team returns: B. Modern (costumes), Terry J. Barto (choreographer), and Evan Parker (lighting). Sound design is by Robby MacLean.  
  
"Pantomime has nothing to do with mime," exlained director Paul Whitworth. " 'Panto' is really a sort of anarchic homegrown musical that is always based on a fairy tale." There is always a 'dame' who is played by a man, and a eclectic array of songs, dances, jokes, plus audience participation."  
  
"Already there is a lot of excitement about _Gretel & Hansel,_" added Marcus Cato, managing director of SSC. "We anticipate selling out the majority of performances before the winter holiday season begins. Tickets sales are way ahead of last year at this time."   
  
_Gretel & Hansel_ could become a new holiday favorite, with sympathetic characters, surprising twists, and a witch audiences will love to hate. Last year _Cinderella_ celebrated the importance of a true heart.

This year, the theme of _Gretel & Hansel_ concerns discovery, through trial and adversity, of what truly nourishes the human spirit.  
  
_Gretel & Hansel_ begins with a preview matinee at 1 p.m. on Saturday, November 17, with the official opening performance on Sunday, November 18. For dates and times see the SSC [web site][1] or call the Ticket Office at (831) 459-2159.   
  
The November 17 special preview price is $15; tickets for all other shows are $15 for children 12 and younger, $22 for seniors (62 and over), students, UCSC staff, and $28 for the general public.  
  
Advance tickets are available through the UCSC Ticket Office at the Theater Arts Center at UCSC or Call (831) 459-2159. Ticket office hours are Tuesday-Friday, noon to 6 p.m., and Saturday 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Tickets can also be purchased [online][2].
