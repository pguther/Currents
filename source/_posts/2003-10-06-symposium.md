UCSC will celebrate the student experience this weekend with a major academic symposium, the dedication of College Nine and College Ten, a fundraising dinner, a reunion of scholarship recipients, and more.

On Friday (October 10), the campus is hosting the [**Kerr Symposium**][1] on the critical role that public research institutions must play in preparing students to be future leaders in all fields and professions.

The symposium will bring together national and state leaders in education to speak on the role higher education plays in society in the 21st century. (See earlier [**Currents story][2]**.)

Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood will welcome the guests, including Richard Atkinson, who stepped down as UC president on October 1.

On Saturday, UCSC will celebrate the [**inauguration of its two new residential colleges**][3]\--the first new colleges to be opened on campus in nearly 30 years.

Dignitaries, students, faculty, and alumni will participate in a panel presentation and dedication ceremonies for Colleges Nine and College Ten from 10:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. The event will take place in the Multipurpose Room and out on the lawn.

Saturday evening, the campus will host a [**first-ever gala dinner**][4] to raise money for undergraduate and graduate students, and Atkinson will be presented with the first UCSC Foundation Medal in recognition of his leadership.

On Sunday, October 12, current and alumni recipients of the Karl S. Pister Leadership Opportunity Awards Program Scholarships will gather for a [**reunion brunch**][5]. Established in 1993, the program helps students from 13 regional community colleges transfer to UCSC.

That evening, the annual Sidhartha Maitra Memorial Lecture hosts travel writer and author Pico Iyer, who will discuss "Islam and California: A Cultural Romance," at 4 p.m. in the UCSC Recital Hall. (See earlier [**Currents story**][6].)

Other events taking place over the weekend include the annual [**Harvest Festival**][7] at the UCSC Farm on Saturday, from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., the quarterly meeting of the UCSC Foundation, and a meeting of the UCSC Alumni Council.
