  UCSC will celebrate the student experience this weekend with a major academic symposium, the dedication of College Nine and College Ten, a fundraising dinner, a reunion of scholarship recipients, and more.

<p>
  On Friday (October 10), the campus is hosting the <a href="http://kerrsymposium.ucsc.edu/"><b>Kerr Symposium</b></a> on the critical role that public research institutions must play in preparing students to be future leaders in all fields and professions.
</p>
<p>
  The symposium will bring together national and state leaders in education to speak on the role higher education plays in society in the 21st century. (See earlier <b><a href="http://currents.ucsc.edu/03-04/09-22/kerr.html">Currents story</a></b>.)
