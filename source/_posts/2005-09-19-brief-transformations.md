UC Santa Cruz is currently undergoing a variety of transformations in the way it does business--how purchasing is managed, the process for hiring, the collection and retrieval of students' academic information, etc. In order to help ensure that faculty and staff can access support for questions involved with these transformation projects, two new sources of information have been established through the Office of the Executive Vice Chancellor.

The first is a website, [www.ucsc.edu/transformations][1]. At this site, you will find background information on the many important transformation projects, and there are direct links to the different online resources that each transformation project has established to offer help with problems or questions.

Additionally, a Transformation Referral Line has been established. That telephone number is 459-1999. The Referral Line is answered from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Friday, and is a temporary service that has been set up during the changes taking place on campus. Referral Line staff will connect you with the appropriate Help Desk on campus or, if you have already contacted a Help Desk, the Referral Line staff can connect you with other people on campus who have access to the information you need.
