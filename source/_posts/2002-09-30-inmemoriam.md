In Memoriam

**Francisco Parcet**  

A UCSC student died while swimming in the East Field pool Friday (September 28). Francisco Parcet, a Crown College junior who was majoring in mathematics, was pulled from the water by lifeguards at approximately 7:30 p.m.  
  
University fire officials and a crew of paramedics attempted to revive the 26-year-old student for approximately 30 minutes before he was pronounced dead at the scene.  

An international student from Chile, Francisco Parcet had transferred to UCSC last year from Santa Monica Community College.

On Monday (September 30), the cause of his death had not yet been reported by the Santa Cruz County Coroner's Office.
