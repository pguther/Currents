  The Strategy and Planning Office for Information Technology Services (ITS) has now been consolidated with the Program Management Office into a new Office of Portfolio Management (OPM), under the direction of Mark Cianca. Linda Kittle, the former director of strategy and planning for ITS, has become special assistant to Interim Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor David Kliger.

  The Office of Portfolio Management serves as the critical link between the executive vision and the work of the organization. It will be responsible for developing communications and project management methods and standards and ensuring that projects are informed by and align with strategic campus and division initiatives. Specific OPM services will include strategic planning and assessment, program management, project management, communication, and professional development.

  Lindsay Bass, strategy and planning analyst, continues in her current role in the new Office of Portfolio Management. In addition, Lisa Bono, communication coordinator, has moved to OPM.
