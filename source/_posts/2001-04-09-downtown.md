Dear Faculty and Staff:  
  
You are invited to attend a very special and important campus event.  
  
Student Leadership Development and Social Responsibility is hosting a  
universitywide "Town Hall Topical" event (formerly called Campus  
Leadership Retreats). This year's event will focus on creating additional  
campuswide student life opportunities as we open up "a new campus downtown."  
  
As the Student Union and Graduate Student Commons, Ethnic Resource Centers, SOAR, the Career Center, graduate and undergraduate student government offices, and a variety of registered student organizations prepare to relocate to the Bay Tree/Quarry area, our university community has an excellent opportunity to think about how we can all work together creatively to expand co-curricular programs and services for our students.  
  
Developing the Bay Tree/Quarry area as a vibrant "campus downtown," poised to meet the growing needs of the multiple on- and off-campus communities that comprise our unique university, will be highlighted in the Town Hall discussion.  
  
In the past, this event has provided an exciting opportunity for students,  
staff, and faculty to come together to share ideas and collaborate on  
campus issues. I encourage the UCSC faculty and staff community to join  
the students in this timely dialogue.
