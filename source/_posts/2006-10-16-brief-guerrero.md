The UCSC Arboretum will conclude its 2006 concert series on October 19 with a tribute to the late Mexican American singer and composer Lalo Guerrero. Performers include Danny Valdez, star of the movie_ Zoot Suit,_ members of the group Ozomatli, members of Mariachi Azteca de San Jose, and a collaboration of Bay Area Chicano musicians.

Widely regarded as the father of Chicano music, Lalo Guerrero wrote and recorded songs in virtually every genre of Latin music, including salsa, nortena, banda, rancheras, boleros, corridos, cumbias, mambos, cha cha chas, socially relevant songs, swing, rock and roll, and blues. His songs dominated the charts in the U.S., Mexico, and South America during the peak of his recording career in the 1950s and 60s. His son, [Mark Guerrero][1], notes that "[Lalo Guerrero's] songs about Cesar Chavez and the farm workers, the braceros, martyred journalist Ruben Salazar, and the plight of undocumented workers have chronicled Chicano history and inspired his people." In 1996 he was presented with the National Medal of the Arts at a White House ceremony in recognition of a lifetime of creative achievement. Lalo Guerrero performed all over the world and with great energy until shortly before his death in 2005 at the age of 88.

Doors open at 5:30 p.m. and the show begins at 6:30 p.m. Tickets are $11 in advance and $13 at the door. Tickets may be purchased at Logos bookstore in downtown Santa Cruz and Norrie's Gift Shop at the Arboretum. For more information, go to [Arboretum Music Series][2] web site.
