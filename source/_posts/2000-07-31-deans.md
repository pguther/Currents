Two respected professors will take leadership of the Divisions of Humanities and Graduate Studies starting in August.

Biologist Frank Talamantes was appointed last week to the position of vice provost and dean of graduate studies. Talamantes, a professor of molecular, cellular, and developmental biology, will begin a three-year term in the position on August 1 ([more][1]).

Wlad Godzich, who comes to UCSC from the University of Geneva in Switzerland, will become dean of UCSC's Humanities Division, effective August 7. In Switzerland, Godzich was professor of English and comparative literature, chair of the Emergent Literatures program, and a professor in the university's Graduate Institute of European Studies ([more][2]).
