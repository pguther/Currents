**Karen Ottemann![][1]****  
**Assistant Professor, Biology/Environmental Toxicology  
  
Karen Ottemann studies the mechanisms used by disease-causing bacteria to sense and respond to their environments, both inside and outside the animals they infect. Her current studies focus on how the ulcer-causing bacterium _Helicobacter pylori_ colonizes the stomach. Eventually, her research may lead to the development of more effective antibiotics. Ottemann received her B.S. in bacteriology from UC Davis and her Ph.D. in microbiology and molecular genetics from Harvard University. Before joining the UCSC faculty, she was a postdoctoral researcher at UC Berkeley.**

William Scott is affiliated with the Center for the Molecular Biology of RNA and is working to understand the structure and function of complex RNA molecules. He is particularly interested in RNA molecules that have enzymatic activity and in understanding how proteins and drugs interact with RNA. Scott received B.S. degrees from Bates College and his Ph.D. from UC Berkeley. Before joining the UCSC faculty in 1998, he was a postdoctoral fellow at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge, England, and, briefly, an assistant professor at Indiana University.
