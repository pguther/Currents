  <a name="energy" id="energy"></a>'Energy Savers' contest under way at the colleges<br>
</p>
<p>
  <img align="right" height="122" src="../art/energyslug.gif" width="150" alt="">The Colleges and University Housing Services (CUHS) is encouraging students to save energy by holding an <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/cuhsfacilities/Energy/EnergySaverpage.htm">Energy Savers</a> contest among the colleges during winter quarter. The competition includes all 10 colleges, with students divided into two divisions--one for dorms and another for apartments.
</p>
<p>
  By looking at energy use figures for the previous three quarters, CUHS has calculated a baseline average energy use per student in each division at each college. The college that achieves the largest percentage reduction in their division this quarter from the baseline amount wins first place. A ranking update will be provided to the colleges in early February, and winners will be announced March 7.
</p>
<p>
  There will be first, second, and third place winners in each division; first place winners will receive $300, second place $200, and third place $100. Students will be encouraged to use the money for a celebratory event.
</p>

  <a name="lubeck" id="lubeck"></a>Sociology professor Paul Lubeck joins panel discussing conditions in Nigeria
</p>
<p>
  Professor of sociology Paul Lubeck was part of a recent panel discussion on the oppression of women in Nigeria hosted by the World Affairs Council of Northern California.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The event was held one night before the screening of the PBS <i>Frontline</i> documentary "Things Fall Apart," a look at women's role in Nigeria. Lubeck appeared with <i>Frontline/World</i> co-producers Alexis Bloom and Cassandra Herrman, and <i>Frontline</i> editor Stephen Talbot.
</p>
<p>
  Bloom and Herrman were filming the documentary during the recent violence in Nigeria that erupted over the Miss World competition. Lubeck, whose career has been devoted to the study of Islam in Africa, discussed that violence in the broader context of Nigeria's struggle to become democratic after years of military rule and the suppression of religious and ethnic disputes.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Nigeria, the most populous country in Africa and a major exporter of oil, is made up of 250 ethnicities following both the Christian and Muslim faiths.<br>

  <span class="sectionhead"><a name="growth" id="growth"></a>UC graduate enrollment growth on target<br></span>
</p>
<p>
  The University of California is on target to increase graduate enrollment and is even ahead of schedule in boosting graduate science and engineering education, UC Senior Vice President and Provost C. Judson King reported January 16 in a press release issued by the Office of the President.<br>
</p>
<p>
  In addition, UC is managing to increase graduate student financial support, both in expenditures per student and in total expenditures, King told the UC Board of Regents in a progress report on graduate student enrollment.<br>
  <br>
  King's report was requested by the Board of Regents after the university's Commission on the Growth and Support of Graduate Education reported in January 2002 that UC needed to expand its graduate enrollment if the state were to remain economically competitive.<br>

  <a name="bikes" id="bikes"></a>Campus police cracking down on illegal bicycle parking
</p>
<p>
  Bicyclists have been locking their bikes to light posts, handrails, ramps, stairs, and transit shelters. This creates hazards for pedestrians and can prevent access by those with disabilities, thus violating the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).<br>
</p>
<p>
  The campus is now enforcing the current UCSC code, which states that bicycles "...shall not be parked, stood, or locked against any light post, stair railing, ramp, or any portion thereof, nor shall they block in any way curb cuts, ramps, or paths of accessible travel. Bicycles shall be parked in bicycle racks provided; those parked elsewhere may be impounded."
</p>
<p>
  Beginning Tuesday, January 21, any illegally parked bicycle may be impounded. The bicycle owner will be responsible for all costs associated with this action, including the citation, an impound fee, and the cost of removing the bicycle from where it is locked.<br>
  <br>
  To report areas where bikes are parked illegally, contact the University Police at (831) 459-2231. If you have any questions about this enforcement effort, contact Susan Willats at (831) 459-3759.<br>
