The "College Infill Apartments" project, which would provide on-campus housing for approximately 640 undergraduates in apartment units that would be built at Cowell, Stevenson, and Porter Colleges, will be the subject of a public hearing on April 18.  
  
The meeting, from 6 to 8 p.m. at UCSC's Office of Campus and Community Planning, has been scheduled to receive comments on the project's Draft Environmental Impact Report. The office is located at 515 Swift Street in Santa Cruz.  
  
At this meeting, campus planners will provide a description of the project and its environmental impacts, and members of the public will be invited to give oral comments on the Draft EIR.  
  
The accommodations for 640 students would be provided in a total of 140 apartment units, to be divided among the three colleges. In all, 13 two- to four-story buildings would be erected. Residence halls, but not apartments, currently exist at the three colleges.  
  
If approved, the project could begin this summer, and the apartments could be ready for occupancy in spring 2003.  
  
For more information, call Christine Aldecoa at (831) 460-3573.
