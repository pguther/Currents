Prominent international economists gathered on campus recently for the third annual SCCIE International Economics Conference, where research in the areas of international finance and trade was presented. Sponsored by the [Santa Cruz Center for International Economics][1] (SCCIE), the conference November 3-4 included a series of workshops that attracted about 50 participants, including graduate students. Topics included:

* trade and global warming
* budget policy and currency crises
* an evaluation of intellectual property rights agreements enforced by the World Trade Organization

SCCIE's goal is to sponsor research and seminars on key policy issues in international economics. Its members include international economists from the UCSC Economics Department, as well as members of other departments on campus, graduate students, and affiliated research associates.  
  
"Our objective is to become one of the world's leading institutions in the field of international economics," said SCCIE coordinator Michael Hutchison, one of four economics professors who are codirectors of the center. "We want to study policy issues that are important to the state of California and to international economics generally."  
  
The center is poised to hire two more economists this year and to expand its programs, added Hutchison.   
  
In addition to the annual conference, SCCIE activities include workshops, sponsorship of a seminar series, publication of working papers, and hosting prominent visitors to campus. Recent workshops focused on the World Trade Organization and on international labor issues.   
  
SCCIE also cosponsors, with UC San Diego, the West Coast Japan Economic Seminar. Activities are coordinated closely with the Economics Department and the doctoral program in international economics. SCCIE is also working with College Nine, which has an international studies theme, to offer undergraduate research awards in the area of international studies.  
  
"As a research institute, SCCIE is in a position to involve more graduate and undergraduate students and to bring more visiting scholars to campus," said Hutchison. "We look forward to developing our programs and expanding our impact, both on campus and off."  
  
Hutchison is joined in administering the center by fellow economics professors Michael Dooley, K. C. Fung, and Nirvikar Singh. Hutchison and Singh share research interests that focus on international trade issues, while Hutchison and Dooley have expertise in international finance.
