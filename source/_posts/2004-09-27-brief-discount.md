<p>
  College students across California can stretch their budgets by enrolling in a discount program which will save qualifying applicants 20 percent on their monthly energy bills.
</p>
<p>
  Eligibility for the California Alternate Rates for Energy (CARE) program is based on the combined income of all students living in a household, and the student applying must not appear as a dependent on anyone else's tax returns, except for a spouse's.
</p>

  Additional information and applications for the program are available at <a href="http://www.pge.com/care">www.pge.com/care.</a>
