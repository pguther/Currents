College students across California can stretch their budgets by enrolling in a discount program which will save qualifying applicants 20 percent on their monthly energy bills.

Eligibility for the California Alternate Rates for Energy (CARE) program is based on the combined income of all students living in a household, and the student applying must not appear as a dependent on anyone else's tax returns, except for a spouse's.

Additional information and applications for the program are available at [www.pge.com/care.][1]
