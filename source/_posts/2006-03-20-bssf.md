An alumni panel discussion, reunion luncheon, distinguished faculty lecture, and wine tasting are just a few of the events on the crowded schedule for Banana Slug Spring Fair.

The annual alumni weekend April 22-23 will also include plenty of opportunities to reconnect with old friends at an array of reunions based on fields of study, graduation year, and affinity groups.

The first of Saturday's major events will be a panel discussion featuring distinguished campus graduates reflecting on how UCSC changed their world, and how they are changing the world today. Participants are George Robert Perkovich, author of _India's Nuclear Bomb_; Emmy Award-winners Chuck Ranberg and Anne Flett-Giordano; and Ellen W. Chu, a senior editor with the Government Accountability Office.

Next, alumni can reunite with classmates and favorite faculty members at the All-Alumni Reunion Luncheon on Saturday. Special recognition will be given to alumni celebrating 5- to 35-year reunions.

The Distinguished Faculty Lecture, "Financial Crises Around the World" by Michael Hutchison (Merrill '76, B.S. Economics), will immediately follow the luncheon. Hutchison, professor of economics and interim dean of social sciences, joined the faculty at UCSC in 1985. He is one of the world's leading experts in international finance and the Japanese economy, and frequently consults with central banks around the world.

For the first time, the Alumni Association's popular annual Alumni Vintners Wine Tasting, which in the past has been held during the summer, will take place during Banana Slug Spring Fair. The event will feature gourmet food, select wines, and music, all by alumni, from 5 to 7 p.m. at the Colleges Nine and Ten Multipurpose Room below the University Center. The cost is $37 for Alumni Association members, and $40 for nonmembers.

The many other reunion weekend events will include a special session with UCSC Admissions Office staff for alumni parents whose children are interested in attending UCSC; the "Cowell Press Wayzgoose," a gathering of alumni and friends of the Cowell Press; and a reunion of alumni who, in the early '80s, were involved with TWANAS (Third World and Native American Students) Press.
