  <a name="Crown" id="Crown"></a><font color="#003399">Crown Dining Hall reopens after renovation</font>
</h3>The Crown Dining Hall reopened in May after a year's closure for extensive renovation. The dining hall now has an attractive, roomy, and efficient serving area illuminated with natural light. New features also include a full grill, pizza production area, and salad and deli counters outside the main serving area.
<p>
  The dining hall reopened with a ribbon-cutting ceremony on May 21 attended by Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood, Crown Provost Joel Ferguson, and interim Crown CAO Alex Belisario, followed that evening with a Casino Night and live band for students. The following week, the college held a lunch for the architects, staff, students, and contractors involved in the planning, redesign, and renovation of the facility.<br>
  <br>
  The 30-year-old facility required major renovation to accommodate the increased numbers of students at Crown and Merrill Colleges, and to upgrade refrigeration and heating systems to conform to new standards. Seismic and other building systems were updated as well. Banana Joe's, the college coffee shop, reopened in spring 2001 after similar renovation<br>

</h3>
<p>
  The committee looking at access policies for university-owned housing for faculty and staff is meeting throughout the summer and plans to make a recommendation in early October to John Simpson, campus provost and executive vice chancellor.<br>
  <br>
  Simpson had initially directed the committee to make a recommendation on housing by June 15, but the committee requested more time to gather information and receive input from the campus community, said Assistant Chancellor Leslie Sunell, the committee chair. A campus forum on housing was held May 20.<br>
  <br>
  In August, the <a href="http://planning.ucsc.edu/pac/cwc.html">Campus Welfare Committee</a> will receive the results of an independent survey of demand for university-sponsored housing among faculty and staff. The committee is now working on a concept paper to be used in further discussion with the campus community in the fall. A second public forum on housing issues is planned for mid-September.
