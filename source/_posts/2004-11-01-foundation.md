Lee S. Ting, advisory director at W. R. Hambrecht and former vice president and managing director of geographic operations at Hewlett-Packard, will speak at UCSC on Friday, November 5.

Ting will speak on "Innovation Leadership in the Global Economy" for the fall UCSC Foundation Forum at 4:30 p.m. in the Baskin Engineering Auditorium. The lecture is free and open to the public. Dedication ceremonies will take place earlier in the day (3 to 4:15 p.m.) for the new auditorium and the nearby Engineering 2 Building. Shuttle service will be available from the Barn Theater parking lot at the base of campus beginning at 2 p.m.

Ting has nearly 40 years of experience in the high-tech industry, including work with start-up companies, industry leaders like Hewlett-Packard, and venture capital firms. He is currently an advisory director for W. R. Hambrecht and for WK Technology Fund, a leading venture capital firm in Taiwan. Ting formerly served as vice president and managing director of geographic operations for Hewlett-Packard, where he was responsible for HP's field administration, marketing services, and customer support infrastructure worldwide and for long-term direction and development of the company's international presence.

Ting has served as an adviser to Stanford's Asia Pacific Technology Group and participated in the group's Distinguished Speaker Series. In 2001, he was named to the Engineering Hall of Fame at Oregon State University's College of Engineering. Ting is a member of the Engineering Dean's Advisory Council at UCSC.

The UC Santa Cruz Foundation Forum brings together UCSC Foundation trustees, faculty, students, and the Santa Cruz community to hear engaging speakers and participate in discussions on current subjects that affect their common interests and goals. The lecture series, inaugurated in 2002, is sponsored by the Office of the Chancellor and the UCSC Foundation.
