The release of a three-disc boxed set of works by songwriter and mathematician **Tom Lehrer** has provoked extensive coverage--all of it glowing--in the media_ _recently. Articles have appeared in Bay Area papers such as the _San Francisco Chronicle_ and the _Oakland Tribune._ A story also appeared recently in the _New York Times,_ featuring a four-color shot of Lehrer at the piano in his Santa Cruz home, and stating, "Tom Lehrer finds the enduring appeal of his songs 'amazing.' Maybe he needs to listen to a new three-CD set of his work."

The appointment of theater arts professor **Kathy Foley** to the Chandra Bhandari Endowed Chair in India Studies was reported recently in _India West._

It isn't easy helping your friends make an independent movie, according to music production supervisor **Sven Davis**. Davis detailed his experience in a [feature story][1] that appeared last month in the _San Francisco Examiner-Chronicle._ After delivering a seven-foot-long latex shark to the L.A. set, Davis was willing to help out wherever he could. But, unfortunately, volunteers--viewing their work on the set as a possible career advancement--regarded Davis as a threat to their own industrious appearance. Davis was useful for a moment, when they needed him and the director's mother to stand in as extras. "I can now say," Davis summarized, "that I excel at doing nothing on both sides of the camera."
