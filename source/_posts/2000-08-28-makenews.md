  The release of a three-disc boxed set of works by songwriter and mathematician <b>Tom Lehrer</b> has provoked extensive coverage--all of it glowing--in the mediarecently. Articles have appeared in Bay Area papers such as the <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> and the <i>Oakland Tribune.</i> A story also appeared recently in the <i>New York Times,</i> featuring a four-color shot of Lehrer at the piano in his Santa Cruz home, and stating, "Tom Lehrer finds the enduring appeal of his songs 'amazing.' Maybe he needs to listen to a new three-CD set of his work."

  It isn't easy helping your friends make an independent movie, according to music production supervisor <b>Sven Davis</b>. Davis detailed his experience in a <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2000/07/16/SC38836.DTL">feature story</a> that appeared last month in the <i>San Francisco Examiner-Chronicle.</i> After delivering a seven-foot-long latex shark to the L.A. set, Davis was willing to help out wherever he could. But, unfortunately, volunteers--viewing their work on the set as a possible career advancement--regarded Davis as a threat to their own industrious appearance. Davis was useful for a moment, when they needed him and the director's mother to stand in as extras. "I can now say," Davis summarized, "that I excel at doing nothing on both sides of the camera."
