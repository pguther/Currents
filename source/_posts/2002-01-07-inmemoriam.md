  Those who knew her will long remember "her quick smile and amazing laugh, her wonderful sense of humor, her unfailing dedication to the physics faculty, staff and students, and the friendship she extended to everyone she met," wrote Charlotte Moreno, assistant dean of the Division of Natural Sciences, in a letter to the campus natural sciences community on behalf of Dean David Kliger and the Physics Department.

  The Physics Department is planning a memorial service in the early spring; the details will be publicized to the campus later in winter quarter.<br>
