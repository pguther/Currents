Legends of China, a nonprofit organization that focuses on positive relationships between the U.S. and China, is sponsoring a summer trip to China. Join other UCSC and UC staff, students, faculty, and alumni on a 10-day trip that includes visits to the Great Wall, Beijing, the Forbidden City, and the Summer Palace.

The central event of the trip is a ceremony at the Great Wall where 500 Chinese university students will join 500 U.S. university students, staff, and faculty to celebrate world peace and the growing good will between the two countries.

The tentative dates for the trip are July 18 - 28, and the cost is from $1,766 per person. The trip includes round-trip airfare from San Francisco, hotels, all meals, ground transportation, historical site admission, and guides. The Legends of China Foundation underwrites a significant part of the cost for each participant. For further information, visit the [Legends of China][1] web site. The UCSC campus coordinator is Esperanza Nee; she can be contacted at (831) 459-4342.

There will be three information sessions on campus:
