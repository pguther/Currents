Artist, author, and critic [Allucquere "Sandy" Stone][1] will speak at the Merrill College Cultural Center on April 26 from 7:30 to 9 p.m. Her talk is titled "Drive-By Theory." The talk is free and open to the public.

Stone, a graduate of UCSC's history of consciousness doctoral program, has been a founding artist, activist, and theoretician in the transgender, cyborgian, virtual reality, and new media realms. Her nonfiction includes _The War of Desire and Technology at the Close of the Mechanical Age, The Empire Strikes Back: A Posttransexual Manifesto, Cyborg Detector,_ and _Alien Roadkill._ In addition, she has created numerous works of fiction and art.

Stone is associate professor at the University of Texas at Austin, a senior artist at the Banff Centre, professor of new media and performance at the European Graduate School (EGS). Her primary areas of interest include new media production, video production, performance, installation, gender and sexuality with emphasis on transgender, and fantasy/science fiction.

"All my current work," says Stone, "involves making stuff, though inevitably the stuff is theory-laden."
