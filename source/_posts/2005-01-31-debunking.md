Sara Solovitch, a lecturer in UCSC's science writing program, was looking forward to working with a modern-day hero when she drove to San Jose last August for her first meeting with Jumana Mikhail Hanna.

In July 2003, the _Washington Post_ had run a powerful front-page story about Hanna, an Iraqi woman who said she had endured torture and rape in an Iraqi prison in the mid-1990s.

Her harrowing story was cited in Senate testimony by Deputy Defense Secretary Paul Wolfowitz, and Hanna had been granted refugee status and resettled in San Jose.   

Solovitch had just signed a contract to coauthor a book with Hanna about her horrific experiences under Saddam Hussein's regime. But Hanna's story soon began to unravel as Solovitch tried to confirm the details. In a lengthy article in the January issue of _Esquire_ magazine, Solovitch describes how she gradually came to the realization that Hanna had fabricated the entire story and fooled everyone from the Pentagon to the _Washington Post._  

Since the publication of Solovitch's _Esquire_ article, the _Washington Post_ has published a report acknowledging that the original story was based on false claims, as well as an article by the _Post's_ ombudsman about the newspaper's investigation of the story. In addition, Solovitch's debunking of the _Post_ story has been covered by the _New York Times, Chicago Sun-Times, USA Today,_ National Public Radio, and other media.   

Solovitch, who lives in Santa Cruz and teaches a course on "The Science Profile" for the Science Communication Program, is a freelance magazine writer and former staff writer for the _Philadelphia Inquirer._ Her stories have appeared in _Esquire, Outside, Wired, Omni, Legal Affairs,_ and other publications, and she has won numerous awards, including the 2002 Outstanding Magazine Article by the American Society of Journalists and Authors.
