  Documentary filmmaker and activist Renee Tajima-Pena will talk about her efforts to document social change and social justice issues in a free lecture for the campus community at noon on March 3 in Room D at the Bay Tree Conference Center.
</p>
<p>
  Tajima-Pena, an associate professor of community studies at UCSC, recently won a CINE Golden Eagle award for her film <i>My Journey Home</i>, which debuted on PBS last year. The two-hour documentary tells the stories of four Americans who travel to their ancestral homelands. She also won a distinguished achievement award from the International Documentary Association and an Alpert Award for the Arts for her segment of a seven-hour series titled "The New Americans," which also aired on PBS last year.

  Tajima-Pena leads UCSC's new master's degree program in social documentation, which is scheduled to enroll its first class in September 2005.
