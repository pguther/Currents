Documentary filmmaker and activist Renee Tajima-Pena will talk about her efforts to document social change and social justice issues in a free lecture for the campus community at noon on March 3 in Room D at the Bay Tree Conference Center.

Tajima-Pena, an associate professor of community studies at UCSC, recently won a CINE Golden Eagle award for her film _My Journey Home_, which debuted on PBS last year. The two-hour documentary tells the stories of four Americans who travel to their ancestral homelands. She also won a distinguished achievement award from the International Documentary Association and an Alpert Award for the Arts for her segment of a seven-hour series titled "The New Americans," which also aired on PBS last year.

Tajima-Pena leads UCSC's new master's degree program in social documentation, which is scheduled to enroll its first class in September 2005.

The Diversity Lecture Series features presentations by UCSC faculty. The series is sponsored by the Equal Employment Opportunity/Affirmative Action Office. For more information, call (831) 459-5087 or send e-mail to [andream@ucsc.edu][1].
