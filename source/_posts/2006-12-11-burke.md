_Lee Miller, A Life_, the latest book by longtime UCSC humanities research associate Carolyn Burke, has been named one of the 100 Notable Books of 2006 by the _New York Times_. Burke's biography of the iconic _Vogue_ model turned World War II photojournalist was also nominated for the 2006 Biography Award by the National Book Critics Circle.

Since its publication earlier this year by Alfred Knopf (U.S.) and Bloomsbury (U.K.), _Lee Miller _ has received rave reviews and widespread media attention. The book was previously featured in the _New York Times_ daily and Sunday review sections and named a NYT "Editors' Choice." London's _Telegraph_ called it an "astounding book," and the _Chicago Tribune_ noted that "demonstrating the same clarity of observation and sensitivity to subtleties that distinguish Miller's photographs, Burke indelibly portrays a radiant woman forced to look into the heart of darkness."

Burke has given presentations about Miller at a variety of venues in the United States, France, and Australia, including the National Arts Club, the Metropolitan Club, NYU's Maison Francaise, Princeton University, University of New South Wales, and Sydney University. Burke met and befriended Miller in Paris when she was writing her last book, _Becoming Modern, The Life of Mina Loy _(1996, Farrar, Straus & Giroux). _Lee Miller_ is set to be published in French translation by Autrement in 2007.

A biographer, art critic, and translator, Burke has taught at UCSC, Princeton, and UC Davis; at the Universities of Western Sydney and New South Wales in Australia; and at the Sorbonne and the University of Lille in France.
