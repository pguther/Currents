UC campuses move away from using Social Security numbers for employee identification  

The Payroll/Personnel System at UCSC currently utilizes an employee's Social Security number as the employee identification number. Due to the sensitive nature of this information and the need to protect against identity theft, all University of California campuses have converted, or will be converting to a randomly generated employee identification number. At UCSC, the new employee ID number format will have a fixed "7" prefix followed by 7 random numbers and a check digit.

The employee ID number conversion will take place November 2-3. The new ID numbers will appear on Surepay statements and paper check stubs beginning on November 27. Current ID cards will still be valid. Employees may request a new employee ID card from their service center. Questions may be directed to each employee's service center, or you can contact Tamara Santos, tamara@cats.ucsc.edu, (831) 459-5189, with any questions or concerns. Additional information is also available [online][3]_.

Campus and city police join forces to minimize traffic impact on Westside neighborhoods

With the new academic year upon us, Westside Santa Cruz neighbors have requested that campus commuters using cars take the main thoroughfares of Mission, Bay, and High Streets so that the traffic and safety impacts in residential areas are minimized. Toward that end, the UCSC and Santa Cruz Police Departments have initiated a "Pace Car" program in the neighborhoods.  

Both activities are explained in a [letter to the campus community][8] from Wes Scott, director of Transportation and Parking Services. In the letter, Scott also encourages members of the campus community to use alternative transportation whenever possible in an effort to reduce the number of cars traveling on the streets that lead to and from the campus.
