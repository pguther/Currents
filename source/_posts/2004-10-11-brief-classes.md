The cost of each class is $15 or $45 for the series of four. The classes are on consecutive Mondays beginning on October 18.

The first class, titled "High Energy Nutrition--High Energy Living," will provide each individual with a "personal profile based on metabolism, dosha, and blood type" and a personal format for the most effective exercise for fat loss and energy optimization.
