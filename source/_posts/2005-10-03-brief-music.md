The Music Department presents an evening of North Indian music featuring internationally acclaimed performer and award-winning composer Rajeev Taranath on sarod, Saturday, October 15, at 7:30 p.m. in the UCSC Music Center Recital Hall. He will be accompanied by Abhiman Kaushal on tabla.

Taranath is a 1999-2000 recipient of the Indian government's highest award in the arts--the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award--given in recognition of outstanding achievement in the field of Hindustani instrumental music. A distinguished disciple of Maestro Ali Akbar Khan, Taranath masterfully combines the depth and rigor of the tradition of Hindustani classical music with an inspired imagination and emotional intensity in his performances.

Kaushal is an outstanding tabla artist who is well known for his rich tone and clarity in performance. His numerous recordings include _Ravi Shankar in Venice, Farewell My Friend_ (with Ravi Shankar), and _Passages_ (with Ravi Shankar and Philip Glass). National Geographic has also recorded his tabla for the soundtrack to the documentary _Man Eaters of North India_.

This concert is funded by the Ali Akbar Khan Endowment for Classical Indian Music and by the Kamil and Talat Hasan Endowed Chair for Classical Indian Music at UCSC. For more information, contact the UCSC Ticket Office, (831) 459-2159.
