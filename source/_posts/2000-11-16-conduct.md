UC Office of the President Sweatshirts produced in a country known for human rights violations have been returned to their licensee after they were found in a University of California at Berkeley bookstore. The return was made under the rules laid down in UC's Code of Conduct for Licensees. "The incident demonstrates that UC's Code of Conduct is working," said Judith Pacult, deputy to Senior Vice President of Business and Finance Joseph Mullinix. "Within hours of my notifying the Cal Student Store buyers that these sweatshirts were discovered in the store, the buyers pulled the products from shelves, other UC campuses were notified, and I started to work with the company that had sent the apparel to find out what had gone wrong," said Maria K. Rubinshteyn, director of the Office of Marketing and Management of Trademarks at UC Berkeley. The merchandise in question--two styles of sweatshirts--was spotted by a photographer with the _Daily Cal_ student newspaper. The apparel bore labels indicating that the garments had been produced in Burma, now known as Myanmar. The material had been produced by JanSport, a company located in Wisconsin that is among the top 10 licensees of apparel for the University of California. JanSport officials notified UC officials that it has so far stopped more than 40,000 units of this product from being distributed to customers and had stopped several shipments from reaching the United States. James Koehne, a JanSport vice president, wrote in a letter received by university officials on Oct. 17 that his company first became aware that merchandise was being produced in Myanmar in June 2000. Their supplier had moved the factory location "without our knowledge and permission" from China to Myanmar, Koehne said in his letter. Despite efforts to isolate and stop shipments of the merchandise, some goods were mixed with goods made in other countries and a few items were missed during audits. "The products received by the Cal Student Store came from these two mistakes," said Koehne. "We hope this letter, along with the recall of all products produced in Myanmar, confirms our commitment to be a responsible vendor," said Koehne. Since the incident, Koehne and other representatives from JanSport have met on the Berkeley campus with university officials to discuss the error. Koehne is also slated to make a presentation at an upcoming meeting of the student/faculty monitoring group, appointed by Mullinix. "Our commitment to fair and humane work standards is strong,""said Mullinix. "We share the students' concern about this issue. We will continue to review our policies and make decisions that will make us a leader among institutions that strive for equitable work standards." In 1998, the University of California became one of the few universities in the country to adopt a code of conduct for its trademark licensees that manufacture products with the university's name. In January 2000, UC issued a strengthened code with input from an advisory group of students, faculty and campus administrators. Another committee of faculty and students has been named to study and make recommendations on enforcement and monitoring issues. UC also has participated in a five-university study of apparel manufacturing in seven countries. The report, the "Independent University Initiative," was released in October 2000.
