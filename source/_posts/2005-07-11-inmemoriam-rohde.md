Marc Rohde, a groundskeeper at UCSC for a number of years, died at his home in Prunedale on July 7. He was 51.

Marc was hired by UCSC in 1987 and worked as a groundskeeper until ill health forced him to take a disability retirement in April 2001. The majority of his career was spent at Stevenson College.

Marc was very knowledgeable about plants and garden design, and shared his expertise with all who expressed an interest. He made many friends on campus, and his work beautifying the grounds was greatly appreciated by those who worked at Stevenson, said Lynn Galiste, manager of the Philosophy Department.

In his free time, Marc played in many bands, including one group with his coworker and friend Gary Cunningham. He was also an artist in bonsai, and he had a knack with cartoon caricatures.

A memorial service will be held for Marc on July 23 at the Cowell Provost's House from 1 to 4 p.m. If you would like to attend, wear a Hawaian shirt and bring some flowers--he loved both!
