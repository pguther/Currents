Renee Tajima-Pena's film _Who Killed Vincent Chin?_ was selected for screening as part of a special retrospective during the annual New Directors/New Films festival in New York.

Tajima-Pena, an associate professor of community studies and an independent filmmaker, directed the 1988 Academy Award-nominated film about the race-based murder of a Detroit engineer.

The retrospective featured screenings of 10 groundbreaking documentaries that premiered at the festival and "are as powerful and important today as when they were originally screened in the festival."
