Interested members of the campus and the community will have several opportunities this week to learn more about events since September 11 as UCSC hosts "A Week of Reflection on the Crisis." "Faculty have been participating in teach-ins since the terrorist attacks, and they will continue to do so, but this week marks the most concentrated selection of offerings to date," said history professor Terry Burke, coordinator of UCSC's Ad Hoc Faculty Committee on Current Events. Whether you're interested in domestic implications of the crisis or the energy-related undercurrents of the war on terrorism, check out the **listings below** for a forum that meets your needs. More information on these and other campus events is available on the [Campus Calendar][1]. Ongoing events related to September 11 may be found on a special Currents Online [web site][2], under "Academic Activities."
