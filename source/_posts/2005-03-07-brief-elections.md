Students vote for the election of SUA officers and fees and sometimes participate in opinion polls in the annual campus elections. Elections will be held this year May 4 through 10. The SUA deadline for endorsing items for placement on the ballot is March 29.

Anita Diaz, the campus elections commissioner, will be available at the Bay Tree Building, Third Floor, Room B, on March 8, 15, and 22 from 4 to 6 p.m. to help with ballot language and answer policy questions. You may contact her with concerns or questions at [ald@ucsc.edu][1]
