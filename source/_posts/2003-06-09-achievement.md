Outstanding students received special recognition on Friday, June 6, with the Student Achievement Awards. The event at the University Center was the culmination of UCSC's annual Student Achievement Week.

Awards and scholarships included:

**The Steck Award,** honoring the finest senior thesis completed during an academic year, went to engineering student Ian Turner. Turner's thesis, "An Automated Mass Transit Trip Planner," will be bound, and eight copies printed. The award, which includes $1,000, was presented by Loren Steck. The award is open to all academic divisions, and the winner is chosen from the Chancellor's Award candidates.   
  
**The Fulbright Program **selected** ** Sam Alexander. Congress created the Fulbright Program in 1946 to foster mutual understanding among nations through educational and cultural exchange. Senator J. William Fulbright, sponsor of the legislation, saw it as a step toward building an alternative to armed conflict. The U.S. Student Program awards approximately 1,000 grants annually and currently operates in over 140 countries. The program conducts an annual competition for the scholarships, most of which are for one academic year of study or research.   

**The Donald A. Strauss Scholarship **went to Marcia Winslade. The Strauss Foundation awards scholarships to students from selected four-year California colleges and universities who have demonstrated an interest in public service, have outstanding leadership potential, and are in the upper one-third of their class.   

**The Kenneth and Ann Thimann Scholarship **was given to Stephanie Anastasia of Physical & Biological Sciences. The Kenneth and Ann Thimann Scholarship is awarded to a graduating UCSC senior who has been accepted to graduate school and shows the most promise as a future scientist in one of the disciplines of biology, chemistry, Earth sciences, or physics.  

**Deans' & Chancellor's Awards:** These awards recognize outstanding achievements by undergraduate students within an academic division (Arts, Engineering, Humanities, Physical & Biological Sciences, Social Sciences). Ten Deans' Awards are given to students within each division. Of those students, up to three in each division can be selected to receive a Chancellor's Award.  

John Simpson, Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor, served as emcee and presented the Chancellor's Awards at the awards ceremony. Lynda J. Goff, Vice Provost and Dean of Undergraduate Education, announced the winners of the Strauss Scholarship and the Thimann Award. Student speakers were Winnie Chan and MaryJane Skjellerup. The Deans of each Academic Division presented the deans' awards.
