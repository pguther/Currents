Computer engineer 'spotlighted' on Science Advisory Board web site

A profile of Kevin Karplus, professor of computer engineering, is featured in the ["member spotlight"][1] section of the web site of the [Science Advisory Board][2]. The Science Advisory Board is an international panel of life science and medical professionals formed in 1997. Board members convene electronically to participate in online studies addressing issues of importance to their areas of investigation or clinical specialties. Their comments help to influence the development of new technologies and to improve existing technologies.

Banana Slug chosen as 'Coolest Campus Mascot'

[_CollegeBound Teen][3]_ magazine selected the UCSC Banana Slug as one of the eight coolest campus mascots in its fall 2003 issue. The mascots of UC Berkeley (Oski bear) and UC Irvine (Peter the Anteater) also made the list.

_CollegeBound Teen_ is published nationally two times a year and contains articles on issues of interest to teens, including balancing work and school, eating disorders, college loans, dorm decor, fashion, and fighting procrastination.
