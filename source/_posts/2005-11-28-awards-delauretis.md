History of consciousness professor Teresa de Lauretis has been awarded a doctorate _honoris causa_ from the University of Lund, one of Sweden's oldest and most prestigious universities.

Born and educated in Italy, de Lauretis came to the United States shortly after completing her doctorate in modern languages and literatures at Bocconi University in Milan. Before joining the History of Consciousness Department at UCSC, she taught Italian and comparative literature, semiotics, women's studies, and film studies at several American universities, including the University of Colorado and the University of Wisconsin. She has also held visiting professorships in Canada, Germany, Italy, and the Netherlands, as well as the United States.

The author of seven books and over one hundred essays, de Lauretis writes in both English and Italian. Her works have been translated into 14 other languages of Western and Eastern Europe, Latin America, and Asia. Her books in English include _Alice Doesn't: Feminism, Semiotics, Cinema_ (1984), _Technologies of Gender_ (1987), _The Practice of Love_ (1994), and three edited or coedited volumes of essays, _Feminist Studies/Critical Studies_ (1986), _The Cinematic Apparatus_ (1980), and _The Technological Imagination_ (1980). She is currently working on a book about Freud's theory of drives.
