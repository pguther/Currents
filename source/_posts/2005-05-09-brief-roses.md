  Winter and spring rains have produced both an abundant rose crop and challenging conditions for growers who want to avoid spraying fungicides and other chemicals on their plants. Alan Chadwick Garden manager and rose expert Orin Martin will share his techniques for choosing and growing roses without chemical inputs at a workshop on Saturday, May 14, from 10 am to 12 noon at the Alan Chadwick Garden.
</p>
<p>
  Martin will discuss the importance of selecting disease-resistant varieties, following an aggressive pruning program, and using organically acceptable sprays such as dormant oil to prevent diseases. He'll have an array of roses and rose books on hand for participants to survey, so bring a notebook to jot down information.
</p>
<p>
  The Chadwick Garden supports a collection of approximately 125 roses representing 10-15 classes and 75 varieties. Thanks to a grant from the Stanley Smith Horticultural Trust, the collection has expanded over the past season and now includes a rose demonstration area.
</p>
<p>
  Cost of the rose workshop is $10-$15 for members of the Friends of the UCSC Farm &amp; Garden (sliding scale); $15 general admission, payable the day of the event. For more information, call (831) 459-3240. The workshop is cosponsored by the Center for Agroecology &amp; Sustainable Food Systems and the Friends of the UCSC Farm &amp; Garden.
</p>
<p>
  The main entrance to the Alan Chadwick Garden is located on McLaughlin Drive across from Stevenson College, where free parking will be available.
