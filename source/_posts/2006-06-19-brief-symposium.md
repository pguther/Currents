UCSC will host [Biogeomon 2006,][1] the fifth international symposium on ecosystem behavior, from June 25 to 30.

The symposium focuses on biogeochemical research at watershed, landscape, and global scales. Lindsey E. Rustad of the U.S. Forest Service will deliver the opening plenary address on the response of terrestrial ecosystems to global climate change.

Six keynote lectures and four concurrent daily sessions are scheduled. Poster presentations are a major component of Biogeomon meetings, with posters to be displayed throughout the week and featured in poster sessions on three afternoons.

UCSC environmental studies faculty member Weixin Cheng is a member of the Biogeomon International Organizing Committee.
