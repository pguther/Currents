  <font size="5"><b>Book collection contest winners named</b></font>
</p>
<p>
  I don't know why people are always snooping in each other's bathroom medicine cabinets; looking at somebody's bookshelves always seemed to me a lot more interesting--and a lot more revealing.<br>
</p>
<p>
  You don't have to do your snooping behind locked doors either; in fact, sometimes it's intentionally put on display, like it was at the 35th Annual Book Collection Contest, sponsored by the Friends of the UCSC Library.
</p>
<p>
  Awards for the best book collection were presented in three separate categories: UCSC students, high school students in 9th and 10th grades, and high school students in 11th and 12th grades.
</p>
<p>
  University entrants are eligible with a collection of 25 books or more. High school entrants only need imagine their collections--describing a collection of books and materials that reflects their interest. All contestants must submit a bibliography and an essay describing the special value of their collections.
</p>
<p>
  Winners were awarded a cash prize and matching-gift certificate from area bookstores. Collections are currently on display at the McHenry Library.
</p>
<p>
  The UCSC winners are: Marisa Traylor of Oakes College and Sean Winslow of Cowell College, first-place tie; Andrea Kippes, second place, Merill College.
</p>
<p>
  High school winners in grades 9 and 10 are: Remi LeBoeuf, first place, Pacific Collegiate; Leslie McNiesh of Pacific Collegiate and Taja Sophia Randick of Santa Cruz High School, second-place tie; Hannah Cooperman, Andy Malsbary, and Ryan Kuratomi, all of Pacific Collegiate, third-place tie; Graham Lee, honorable mention, SCHS, Nathaniel Chaney, honorable mention, Pacific Collegiate.
</p>
<p>
  Winners in grades 11 and 12 are: Sarah Avary, first place, SCHS; Abbie Schindler, second place, SCHS; Julia Rose Ando and Nicole Orgain, third-place tie, both of SCHS; Mary Carmen Rodriguez Hernandez, honorable mention, Pacific Collegiate; Laura Brogan, Julia Cato, and Sarah Curtin, honorable mentions, all of SCHS.
