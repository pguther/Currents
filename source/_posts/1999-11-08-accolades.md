</h4><br>
The women's soccer team, coached for the fourth year by Paul Lester, made UCSC history again this year with a best-ever 16-2 season record. They finished the season ranked third in the West Region and 15th in the nation.<br>
<br>
For the first time, the women's soccer team was selected to participate in the NCAA Division III Women's Soccer National Championship Tournament. Six teams from the West Region were among those named to the 45-team tournament. The Slugs lost their first game on Saturday, November 6, in San Diego against the University of Puget Sound and are out of the tournament.
