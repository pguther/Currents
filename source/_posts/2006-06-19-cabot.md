  Heath Cabot, a graduate student in anthropology, has been awarded a Fulbright scholarship to study in Greece.
</p>
<p>
  Cabot's research explores issues of immigration, asylum law, and advocacy in Greece, one of the "more porous" Mediterranean frontiers in the new European Union. Specifically, by focusing on one nongovernmental organization, she is examining how the legal frameworks of asylum and citizenship are shaped and how immigrants and asylum seekers are "managed."
</p>
<p>
  "I hope this work will serve as a qualitative complement to the official data most often enlisted in the construction of immigration and asylum policy," said Cabot.
</p>
<p>
  The U.S. Fulbright Student Program, which will fund travel abroad for more than 1,200 U.S. citizens in the 2006-07 academic year, was established in 1946 to build mutual understanding between the people of the United States and the rest of the world. It is administered by the Institute of International Education.
</p>
<p>
  The Fulbright Program is sponsored by the U.S. Department of State's Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs. In addition to the student program, the Fulbright Program supports American scholars who teach and conduct research abroad, as well as students, scholars, and teachers from other countries who engage in similar activities in the United States. The program operates in more than 150 countries worldwide.
