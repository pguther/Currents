  The Friends of Long Marine Lab Student Research Awards will support 12 student research projects at in the current academic year. The projects cover a range of topics, including the immune function of seabirds, the diving of sea otters and sea lions, and the detection of the neurotoxin domoic acid in local fish.

<p>
  A total of $8,598 was awarded to 12 graduate students. The Friends of LML Awards come from the interest generated by six different endowments: The Jane McHenry Student Awards Fund, the Lillian McPherson Rouse Student Award Fund, the William Baye Heald Scholarship Fund, the Friends of LML Student Support Fund, the Mark T. MacMillan Memorial Prize Fund, and the Ken Norris Marine Mammal Research Award.<br>
  <br>
  Special recognition was given to graduate students Seth D. Newsome, Kit C. Clark, Victoria Welborn, and Martha Overton Burford for having the top four proposals. An awards ceremony and reception will be held at the Seymour Marine Discovery Center on Friday, January 25, at 4 p.m.<br>
