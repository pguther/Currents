**  
How do I get on the for-sale housing waiting list?**

E-mail [facultyhousing@ucsc.edu][1] or call (831) 458-3506

**Who is eligible for on-campus housing?**

UCSC employees who are 1.0 FTE and have a minimum one-year appointment are eligible to apply and purchase campus for-sale housing (with the exception of visiting appointees, post doctorals, and academic student titles).  
  
**Who has the highest priority in obtaining Ranch View Terrace housing?**

Senate faculty have the highest priority. Generally speaking, priority among Senate faculty will be determined by length of time spent on waiting lists, and their academic status at the time of application. (The [Housing Access Policy][2] is available online.)  
  
**What is the current mix of staff homeowners and faculty homeowners?**

Of the existing 132 price-restricted units that are currently owned, 102 were purchased by Senate faculty.

**On average, how often are units available for sale?**

In recent years, there has been very low turnover of the existing for-sale units on campus (approximately 2 percent of existing inventory is offered for resale per year).
