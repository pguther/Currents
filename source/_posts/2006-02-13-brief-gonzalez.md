Juan Gonzalez of _Democracy Now!_ will receive the Ruben Salazar Journalism Award and deliver the Alumni Association's Distinguished Visiting Professor Lecture at 7 p.m. February 15 at the College Nine/College Ten Multipurpose Room.

The Ruben Salazar Journalism Award is given to authors who have excelled in grassroots, independent journalism. A question-and-answer session with Juan Gonzalez will follow the presentation. Gonzalez's visit is cosponsored by College Ten and the Alumni Association.

In 1996, Juan Gonzalez helped launch Pacifica Radio's _Democracy Now!_, an independent news program, which he cohosts with Amy Goodman. A _New York Daily News_ columnist, Gonzalez has won numerous awards in investigative reporting and is president of the National Association of Hispanic Journalists. His most recent book, _Fallout: The Environmental Consequences of the World Trade Center Collapse_, alleges coverups by the Environmental Protection Agency and government officials about health hazards at Ground Zero in New York. Gonzalez also wrote _Harvest of the Empire: The History of Latinos in America._

The Distinguished Visiting Professor program is designed to enrich undergraduate education at UCSC by providing financial support to enable the campus to bring a person of academic distinction for a quarter in each academic year. The Alumni Association endowed the UCSC Alumni Association Distinguished Visiting Professorship in 1982.
