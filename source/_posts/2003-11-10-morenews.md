  <a name="food" id="food"></a>Second Harvest Food Bank launches Holiday Food Drive
</p>
<p>
  The campus drive to collect money and food for the <a href="http://www.thefoodbank.org/">Second Harvest Food Bank</a> is under way. The campus goal this year is to collect 50,000 pounds (2 tons) of food.<br>
</p>
<p>
  <img align="right" height="129" src="../art/second_harvest.jpg" width="176" alt="">The Food Bank provides food to 120 local agencies serving more than 45,000 people every month, 45 percent of whom are children. For every dollar donated, Second Harvest is able to distribute more than $10 worth of food. A $15 cash donation provides over 63 meals to hungry families.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Students are active participants and will do their annual Give-A-Meal Student Hunger Day on November 21. On this day, they will give up a meal in the dining hall, and the cost of the meal will be donated to Second Harvest.
</p>
<p>
  Collection barrels are being placed in highly visible locations around campus and collection bags are being distributed at mail stops. The drive concludes on December 17 when a bus at the base will be loaded with the donations.<br>

  <span class="sectionhead"><a name="hearing" id="hearing"></a>Public hearing on Emergency Response Center Draft EIR<br></span>
</p>
<p>
  The University of California has prepared a Draft Environmental Impact Report (DEIR) for the Emergency Response Center project at the base of the UCSC campus. A Public Hearing on the Draft EIR for the project will be held on November 18, from 6 to 8 p.m., at the Barn Theater, located at the main entrance to the campus.
</p>
<p>
  The project would include the construction of 1) an Emergency Response Center Building, with 7,920 assignable square feet of space, within the UCSC Corporation Yard, and 2) an Equipment Storage Building, with 3,210 assignable square feet of space, on the old UCSC "LPG" site off of High Street.
</p>
<p>
  The Emergency Response Center Building would provide dispatch facilities, offices for emergency service personnel, public police areas (e.g., a report-taking room and a form-processing area), a records office, interview rooms, a laboratory for evidence preparation, and space for data/communications systems. The Equipment Storage Building would provide space for the storage of emergency equipment. Other project elements include parking, fencing, landscaping, utility extensions, and storm drain improvements.<br>
</p>
<p>
  At the Public Hearing, campus planners will provide a description of the project and its environmental effects, and members of the public will be invited to give oral comments on the Draft EIR. Written comments on the Draft EIR can also be submitted during the public review period, which closes on December 29, 2003. Copies of the Draft EIR will be available for review at the McHenry Library and at the main branch of the Santa Cruz Public Library. Copies of the Draft EIR may also be purchased from the UCSC Environmental Assessment Group for the cost of duplication. Call Christine Aldecoa at (831) 460-3573 for additional information or to request accommodations for persons with disabilities.<br>

  <span class="sectionhead"><a name="senate" id="senate"></a>Academic Senate demands reasonable rates from journal publisher<br></span>
</p>
<p>
  The UC Santa Cruz Academic Senate recently passed a resolution demanding that a Dutch publisher of scholarly journals negotiate reasonable rates with the University of California or face a boycott by UCSC faculty.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Elsevier, one of the largest publishers of academic journals and the largest supplier of online journals, began negotiations with the university seven months ago. The company has warned that access to online journals could be lost January 1 if an agreement is not reached, said Ben Crow, associate professor of sociology, who authored the resolution.<br>
</p>
<p>
  As publisher of Science Direct Online, Elsevier controls Internet access to the content of about 1,200 journals. The popularity of Internet access has set the stage for publishers to accummulate "near-monopoly profits" by increasing rates for internet access much faster than the consumer price index, said Crow.<br>
  As chair of the Library Committee of the UCSC Academic Senate, Crow found Elsevier's request for a price increase of more than 6 percent untenable in light of the state's--and university's--budget crunch. The university currently spends half of its budget for online journals on its subscription to Science Direct Online, according to Crow.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The resolution, which passed unanimously, urges faculty to seriously consider cutting ties with Elsevier by refusing to sit on its boards, referee its journals, and submit papers to the publisher<br>
