Burney Le Boeuf, research professor of ecology and evolutionary biology and associate vice chancellor for research, was honored last week by the National Polytechnic Institute in La Paz, Mexico. The institute dedicated its pinniped ecology laboratory to Le Boeuf in recognition of his pioneering research on marine mammals.

At a ceremony on December 4, Rafael Cervantes, director of the institute, and David Aurioles-Gamboa, director of the laboratory, unveiled a plaque bearing Le Boeuf's name over the entrance to the laboratory. Aurioles-Gamboa earned his Ph.D. in biology at UCSC in 1988 and has maintained his connections with the campus through various research collaborations.
