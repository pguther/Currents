Student Achievement Week--an eclectic mix of performances, presentations, visual art, and awards--begins in earnest June 3 and ends June 10.

Art aficionados have a chance to get a jump on Achievement Week at the Irwin Scholars Exhibition, which continues through June 17.

Another early draw is the annual exhibition of works by students in the Science Illustration Program, continuing through June 11. The annual Chautauqua theater festival is performed June 1-4. _A Midsummer Night's Dream_ opera will be presented June 1-4.

During the week itself, the Annual Print Sale is a great opportunity to see the professional quality of the printmaking program. Lithographs, intaglio etchings, digital prints, and handmade books will be among items for sale on June 9 and 10. Running in conjunction with the print sale is the Spring-Quarter Open Studios event.

Research takes center stage at several events, including the Humanities Undergraduate Research Award Colloquia, the Faculty Mentor Program Undergraduate Research Colloquium, the Undergraduate Research Poster Symposium, the Environmental Studies Symposium, the Thesis Exhibition for Digital Arts and New Media, and the Undergraduate Linguistics Conference.

A highlight is the campuswide Awards Ceremony June 9 at the College Nine/College Ten Multipurpose Room. (See profile on [this year's winner][1] of the Strauss Award, one of the students to be honored at the event.)
