Jin Zhang

![][1]Associate professor of chemistry and biochemistry Jin Zhang has published a book on _Self-Assembled Nanostructures_ with four coauthors, Zhong-lin Wang, Jun Liu, Shaowei Chen, and Gang-yu Liu. Zhang is the lead author of the book, one of a series on nanostructure science and technology. The authors are all prominent scientists in the field.  

Nanostructure science and technology now forms a common thread that runs through all physical and materials sciences and is emerging in industrial applications as nanotechnology. Nanostructure refers to dimensions on the nanometer length scale; a nanometer is one billionth of a meter. The realm of nanostructures lies between that of atoms and molecules and the familiar realm of bulk matter.  

_Self-Assembled Nanostructures_ is the first book that addresses in detail the chemistry of self-assembly from molecules to nanostructures.
