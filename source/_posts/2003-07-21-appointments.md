<p class="sectionhead">
  <a name="blumenthal" id="blumenthal"></a>George Blumenthal to be faculty representative to Regents
</p>
<p>
  George Blumenthal, UCSC professor of astronomy and astrophysics and 2001-03 chair of the UCSC Academic Senate, has been elected vice chair of the <a href="http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/senate/">UC Academic Senate.</a> The senate chair and vice chair serve as faculty representatives at meetings of the UC Board of Regents.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Faculty representatives do not vote, but by Regental policy are fully included in all discussion and debate, including Regents-only sessions. They also serve on all committees of the Regents.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Blumenthal's term as vice chair lasts one year, beginning September 1. After that, he will become chair, serving another yearlong term. "The next two years will be most interesting, given the budget situation, a new president and UC provost, and the upcoming decision on whether UC should bid on the contract for the Los Alamos National Lab. I very much look forward to the challenge," Blumenthal said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Blumenthal will be the second UCSC faculty member to serve as chair of the systemwide senate: Michael Cowan, senior adviser to the chancellor and professor and chair of American Studies, served as chair in the 2000-01 year.<br>

</p>

  The portal project is an essential component of information technology (IT) infrastructure that is specifically intended to assist the campus in reducing costs (see story on <a href="transformation.html">IT consolidation</a> in this issue of <i>Currents</i>).<br>
