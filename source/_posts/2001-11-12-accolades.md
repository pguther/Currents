UCSC undergraduate Dylan Woodbury has been awarded a fellowship by the [National Civic League][1] to participate in the National Conference on Governance. The conference, "Digital Democracy: Civic Engagement in the 21st Century," takes place November 15 - 17 in Washington, D.C. "Digital Democracy" will explore how new technologies are transforming public life and will seek to highlight how technology is being used to provide innovative solutions to public problems. Over 60 activists and experts are scheduled to present, including Keith Fulton, America Online, Inc./Time Warner Foundation; Stacy Davis, Fannie Mae Foundation; and Ted Halstead and Michael Lind, New America Foundation, authors of _The Radical Center._
