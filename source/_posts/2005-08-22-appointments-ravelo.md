Christina Ravelo, professor of ocean sciences, has been named director of the Santa Cruz branch of the Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics (IGPP). Ravelo's five-year appointment begins September 1, 2005.   

"Professor Ravelo's extensive experience in promoting interdisciplinary research and education across the array of fields served by IGPP, along with her broad knowledge of how the campus and UC system function, make her the ideal person to serve as leader and advocate for IGPP in the coming years," said Stephen Thorsett, interim dean of the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences, in announcing the appointment.  

The IGPP, a multicampus research unit, established a Santa Cruz branch in 2000 led by founding director Thorne Lay, professor of Earth sciences. The institute supports a wide range of basic research on the origin, structure, and evolution of the Earth, the solar system, and the universe. It includes four interdisciplinary research centers at UCSC: the Center for the Origin, Dynamics, and Evolution of Planets (CODEP), the Center for the Dynamics and Evolution of the Land-Sea Interface (CDELSI), the Center for the Study of Imaging and Dynamics of the Earth (CSIDE), and the Center for Remote Sensing (CRS).  

As director of CDELSI for the past two years, Ravelo successfully spearheaded a National Science Foundation "Major Research Instrumentation" proposal to build a new common-access facility for isotope analysis. She also played a leading role in designing a new interdisciplinary graduate research and training program in coastal environmental change and ocean health.
