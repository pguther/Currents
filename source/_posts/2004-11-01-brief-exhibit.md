"Focus on China," a group photography show, will be on display at the College Eight Cafe for the month of November. The photographers include UCSC staff, students, and alumni who participated in a tour sponsored by Legends of China in summer 2004\.   

The photos cover a range of experiences in Beijing, Shanghai, climbing the Great Wall, and visiting gardens, palaces, and temples. The show was put together by Sara Walsh, College Eight academic adviser.

There will be a reception for the photographers on Saturday, November 13, from 2 to 4 p.m. in the College Eight Cafe.

The College Eight Cafe is open Monday through Thursday from 7:45 a.m. to 11:30 p.m. and on Friday from 7:45 a.m. to 5 p.m.; it's closed on Saturday and Sunday, except for the reception, which is open to the public, on November 13.
