United Way of Santa Cruz County has begun its annual campaign on campus, with organizers hoping to increase the level of participation this year.

A fundraising letter placed in campus mailboxes noted that 126,000 people in Santa Cruz County received services from United Way agencies last year.  
  
The letter also urged members of the campus community to increase their support of the United Way.  
  
"Last year, approximately 17 percent of UCSC's faculty and staff helped the community by contributing to the United Way. We would like to do even better by increasing campuswide participation to over 20 percent," said the letter signed by George Blumenthal, chair of the Academic Senate, and Ed Titus and Janelle Marines, cochairs of the Staff Advisory Board.  
  
All the money raised in the campus drive remains in Santa Cruz County.  
  
Donors may designate some or all of their contributions to go to a specific area of need or a specific agency, or to the general fund. Donations may be made by check or through payroll deduction. Contributors should return their pledges or checks in the envelope attached to the fundraising letter by February 28.
