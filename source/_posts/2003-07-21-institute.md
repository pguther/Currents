<p>
  Meeting July 17, the Committee on Educational Policy of the University of California Board of Regents discussed various aspects of the possible acquisition of the Monterey Institute of International Studies.
</p>
<p>
  UC President Richard C. Atkinson and then-President of the Monterey Institute of International Studies (MIIS) Chester D. Haskell have signed a letter of intent to explore whether the Institute might be incorporated into the University of California. UC Santa Cruz is the lead campus in these discussions.
</p>
<p>
  UCSC Chancellor Greenwood presented a report to the Regents, commenting that "an initial review of the Institute's programs reveals a remarkably close alignment with the academic goals of the Santa Cruz campus, making the benefits of acquisition more compelling and the prospect of successful integration more likely." She also noted that the acquisition of the Institute would help accelerate the campus's efforts to broaden its professional and graduate instruction, research and service within the Monterey Bay Crescent. MIIS President Steven J. Baker was a guest of the chancellor at the meeting.
</p>
<p>
  If an agreement is reached, the Monterey Institute will become an academic resource for all of UC.
</p>
<p>
  The 48-year-old Monterey Institute currently serves about 700 students a year through master's programs with a global emphasis in language teaching, translation, interpretation, policy, public administration, and business administration. In addition, the Institute's Center for Nonproliferation Studies is the world's largest research center devoted to issues of combating terrorism and weapons of mass destruction.
</p>
<p>
  The Regents' Committee on Educational Policy was told that Atkinson plans to sign a memorandum of understanding between UC and the Monterey Institute, outlining principles to guide continuing discussions between the two institutions as part of an implementation plan, and a process for addressing these issues.
</p>
<p>
  If key issues are resolved, the Regents were told, a recommendation to acquire the Monterey Institute will be presented for approval by the Regents.
