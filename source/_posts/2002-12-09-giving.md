  Rising unemployment and looming state budget cuts make one holiday tradition especially important this year: the spirit of giving.
</p>
<p>
  UCSC's campus is no exception, as students, faculty, and staff pitch in to help the Second Harvest Food Drive and various programs helping needy families during the holidays.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "It's a really rewarding experience," said Larry Trujillo, director of the Chicano Latino Student Life Resource Center.
</p>
<p>
  He will soon be setting up a Christmas tree at Merrill College with bulbs representing each child requesting a gift. "All the bulbs go right away. Both the faculty and staff participate," he said, either buying gifts themselves or giving Trujillo the money to do so. Merrill College is part of the Christmas Project, a Santa Cruz County-based organization that helps children in need.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Others on campus are involved in similar efforts, including many who participate in the Adopt a Family program run by the Santa Cruz Volunteer Center. The children often request very basic items, rather than flashy toys, said Kristine Kilkenny, who is handling the Adopt a Family gift-giving program in the Chancellor's Office. "It just breaks our hearts, because they ask for backpacks and jackets," she said.
</p>
<p>
  This year, the Chancellor's Office is "adopting" a single mother with five children, providing food certificates, a practical gift and a "wish" gift. "We love the program," said Kilkenny. "I send out an e-mail every year asking people if they want to participate and it's always a resounding 'yes.' "<br>
</p>
<p>
  Also helping with the Adopt A Family program is the Police Department, which is collecting money for food and gifts for two families, including a 15-year-old mother with a 2-month-old baby. "I think the whole campus is getting involved," said Elisabet Hiatt, business manager.<br>
</p>
<p>
  At the Registrar's Office late last week, a large bin filled with canned goods and nonperishable food had just been emptied and brightly wrapped presents for area children were starting to pile up. The office has taken on a single mother with two children.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "People have just been extra supportive this year," said Lori Hamilton of the Volunteer Center. Hamilton called the campus effort "terrific," and estimated that at least 20 families her center serves are helped by campus Santas.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The Physical Plant is also busy with both Second Harvest and Adopt a Family, taking on one of the larges families available. "Participating in this program is what the holidays are all about," said Donna Barry, executive assistant to Physical Plant director Ilse Kolbus. "I always want to do more than they ask for as we all know how hard it is raising a familiy."
</p>
<p>
  At the Fire Station, firefighters are starting to collect unwrapped toys the Santa Cruz city firefighters will distribute for the Toys for Kids program. Toys can be dropped off from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Friday at the Fire Station on Chinquapin Road, across from the Crown/Merrill Apartments, or at the campus Police Station in the H Barn until December 20.<br>
</p>
<p>
  While most of the students have headed for home, hundreds did their part by forgoing two dining hall meals, with the proceeds going to Second Harvest. Last year, the student contributions and Sodexho's savings on preparation and service allowed SodexhoUSA, which manages UCSC's dining halls and handles the donation program, to write a check for almost $4,500 to Second Harvest. "It's become a tradition here," said Lee Reiff, marketing manager for Sodexho. "The staff applauds students' willingness to do it," she said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Second Harvest's annual Holiday Food Drive wraps up on December 13. Campus Mail Service trucks are in the parking lot just off the campus's main entrance to receive donations of canned goods and other nonperishable food items up until the final day, when food will be loaded into a Metro bus.<br>
</p>
<p>
  In addition to food, checks and cash donations are welcome, because Second Harvest is able to distribute more than $10 worth of food for every dollar donated.<br>
