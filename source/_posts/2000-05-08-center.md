One of the country's most noted scholars on race and inequality, William Julius Wilson is coming to UCSC on Monday, May 15, to deliver a free public lecture on bridging the racial and economic divide in this country. His talk will take place from 5 to 6:30 p.m. in the Media Theater in the Theater Arts complex at UCSC.

  
A recipient of the prestigious MacArthur "genius" award, Wilson will be discussing his new book _The Bridge Over The Racial Divide: Rising Inequality and Coalition Politics._ Two of his previous books, _The Truly Disadvantaged _and_ When Work Disappears,_ were chosen as notable books by the _New York Times Book Review._  
  
Wilson is a leading expert on urban development and social inequality. His influential ideas about race and class politics in America and the need for a progressive, multiracial political coalition to combat growing inequality are being discussed by policy makers, social activists, labor leaders, and academics. His visit to UCSC is being sponsored by the campus's new Center for Justice, Tolerance, and Community (CJTC).  
  
"William Julius Wilson is a strong proponent of coalition building among African Americans, Asians, Latinos, women, religious groups, and civil rights groups," said CJTC director Manuel Pastor, a professor of Latin American and Latino studies. "He has long been on the forefront of analysis and policy designed to forge bridges between diverse communities and their interests, and to press for changes that could benefit working- and middle-class Americans."   
  
Wilson argues that such a multiracial alliance of working- and middle-class Americans could be developed if groups were persuaded to downplay racial differences and focus instead on their common interests, such as stagnating and declining real incomes in the wake of changes in the global economy. He advocates the creation of national work programs, universal health care, a national child care system, and national education standards. Improved job-training programs and public transportation would make "new economy" jobs accessible to the urban poor while also benefiting the working and middle classes, says Wilson, who in 1996 was named one of _Time_ magazine's 25 most influential Americans.  
  
Wilson's talk is the inaugural event sponsored by the CJTC. Free parking will be available beginning at 4:30 p.m. in the Theater Arts parking lot and in the North Remote Lot. Vans will be on hand to shuttle people from the North Remote Lot to the Media Theater.  
  
The CJTC is an interdisciplinary research, policy, and education center created to address issues of social justice and diversity while building collaborative communities. For more information on the center and its activities, call (831) 459-5743 or send e-mail to [cjtc@zzyx.ucsc.edu][1].  
  
Cosponsors of the event include UCSC Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood, the Departments of Anthropology, American Studies, Community Studies, Economics, Education, History, History of Consciousness, Politics, Psychology, Sociology, and Women's Studies. Support was also provided by the Center for Cultural Studies, the Chicano/Latino Research Center, the Latin American and Latino Studies Program, Merrill College, and Oakes College.
