**"Disability, the Law and Higher Education"**

On Tuesday, May 1, the Disability Resource Center will host a daylong program to discuss legal issues and address the impact of increasing numbers of complaints on university campuses relating to access, nondiscrimination, and accommodation of people with disabilities. The presenter will be Salome Heyward, a nationally known attorney and writer specializing in disability law and the Americans with Disabilities Act. Dr. Heyward will be discussing the impact of student program access requirements on faculty and staff, computing access, and employment issues. This program is designed so that people can choose to attend selectively or participate in all programs. Call (831) 459-2089 for more information. Free. All are welcome.

#### Fresh local organic produce

The Farm & Garden's Community Supported Agriculture program still has a few full shares available (half shares are sold out). Full shares are designed to feed about four people and cost $525 for the 22-week season. The weekly box contains about 10 different varieties of vegetables and some fruit. The cost of the share also includes access to the CSA Garden where you may pick your own herbs and flowers. The pickup site will either be at the base of campus or at the Farm. Contact Nancy Vail, CSA coordinator, (831) 459-4661 or navail@cats.ucsc.edu.

#### Child Care Services to hold open house

Child Care Services will hold an Open House on April 17 from 10 to 11:30 a.m. and 3:15 to 5:30 p.m. at the three child care programs located at 599 Koshland Way in Family Student Housing and at the Granary Child Development Center (at the base of campus).

On display at the open house will be a beautiful quilt, created by Pele Fleming, who works in the Housing, Dining & Child Care Facilities Office, as a fundraiser for child care programs. The quilt incorporates pencil drawings of faces by children at the Children's Center, Granary Child Development Center, and School Age Center. A drawing for the quilt will begin at the open house. Proceeds will go toward the improvement of play yards in all UCSC child care programs.

At the open house, the campus community is invited to observe in the classrooms, meet staff and families, share refreshments, and see the quilt.

Each day will be filled with activities from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. A maximum of 24 campers will be enrolled for each weeklong session. Three sessions will be offered: June 25-29; July 9-13; and July 16-20. The curriculum will be repeated each week.

The camp is designed to foster environmental awareness while encouraging children to cooperate and have fun outside. Campers will create their own garden beds, explore insects and herbs, and make garden-based crafts. Campers will be exposed to organic farming practices such as composting and soil care, and they will help apprentices in the UCSC ecological horticulture program harvest vegetables for the weekly market. In addition, campers will enjoy local wilderness excursions that include tours of the UCSC Arboretum, the Pogonip Open Space Preserve, and Wilder Ranch.

Fees are $135/week for members of the Friends of the UCSC Farm & Garden and $150 for nonmembers. Call (831) 459-3240 for registration information.
