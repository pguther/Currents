UC is best of top-ranked university at enrolling low-income students, study says  
  
Six University of California campuses enroll more low-income students than any other top university in the country, public or private, according to a new national study.  

The study by Tom Mortenson of [Postsecondary Education Opportunity][7], a national newsletter on access to higher education, looked at the top 50 national universities as ranked by _U.S. News & World Report_ and ranked them according to the number of Pell Grant recipients they enrolled. Recipients of Pell Grants come from low-income families whose earnings are usually below $35,000 a year.  

The six UC campuses that made the _U.S. News & World Report_ list fill all the top slots in Mortenson's study. UCLA enrolled the highest percentage of low-income students in the nation, with 35.1 percent of its students qualifying for Pell Grants. UC Berkeley follows, with 32.4 percent; UC Irvine is third with 31.5 percent; UC Davis, fourth with 28.5 percent; UC San Diego, fifth with 28.3 percent; and UC Santa Barbara, sixth with 24.8 percent.

UC's own analyses reveal that its other two undergraduate campuses also enroll high percentages of low-income students: UC Riverside (40.9 percent) and UC Santa Cruz (26.7 percent).

Study of UC admissions policies and processes now available  

The Eligibility and Admissions Study Group, appointed by UC President Dynes to examine undergraduate eligibility and admissions policies and implementation, has issued its final report, available online at <http://www.universityofcalifornia.edu/news/compreview/sudygroup_final0404.pdf>  

The report reaffirms UC's basic admissions policy but asks that the administration and Academic Senate evaluate and report on a series of issues the Study Group believes deserve further exploration. These issues for further exploration include such things as the policy of each campus admitting from the full range of the eligibility pool, the alignment between systemwide policy and campus practices in the use of certain admissions criteria, the desirability of including letters of recommendation in future admissions requirements, and the feasibility of making campuses appeals procedures more consistent.
