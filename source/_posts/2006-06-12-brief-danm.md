The Master of Fine Arts program in Digital Arts and New Media invites the public to the opening of an exhibition of work by its very first graduates on Friday, June 16, at 7 p.m. at the [Digital Media Factory][1], 2807 Mission St., Santa Cruz. [DANM.01][2] will premiere video and animation, performance pieces, sound installations, and web art. The exhibit will remain open Saturday, June 17 (10 a.m. to 6 p.m.), and Sunday, June 18 (10 a.m. to 4 p.m.). Christopher Ramirez will perform at 8:15 p.m. at the opening and at 1 p.m. on Saturday. The exhibit is free and open to the public.

UCSC's [Digital Arts and New Media (DANM) program][3] is at the forefront of a new discipline that merges the creative and academic potential of digital media and emerging art forms in exciting and unfamiliar ways. DANM was established in 2004 to address the increasingly central role of digital technology in the arts and to examine the impact of digital arts on culture. The program offers a two-year M.F.A. program that brings together students and faculty from across the art and academic spectra to collaborate on artistic practice and scholarly research.

Founded in 2004, the [Digital Media Factory][1] is a multi-business facility for the design, development, production, replication, management, and distribution of digital information products. It provides an operational base for organizations that serve the digital communication needs of business, education, government, entertainment, and local communities.

For more information about the exhibit, contact Felicia Rice, DANM program manager, at [fsrice@ucsc.edu][4] or (831) 459-1554.
