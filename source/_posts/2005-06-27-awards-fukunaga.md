  UCSC alumnus Cary Fukunaga has been named a silver medal winner in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences' 32nd annual Student Academy Awards competition. He was honored for his film <i>Victoria Para Chino</i>, a 14-minute narrative film based on the true story of the worst single case of illegal immigrant death in United States history.
</p>
<p>
  Fukunaga graduated with a bachelor's degree in history from UCSC in 1999 prior to attending New York University, where he made the award-winning film.
</p>
<p>
  He is one of 12 student winners from 11 different colleges and universities who participated in a week of industry-related activities and social events, culminating with a June 12 awards presentation ceremony at the academy's Samuel Goldwyn Theater. Cinematographers Caleb Deschanel, a five-time Oscar nominee (<i>The Passion of the Christ, The Patriot, Fly Away Home, The Natural, The Right Stuff</i>), and Karl Walter Lindenlaub (whose credits include <i>The Princess Diaries, The Haunting, Independence Day</i>, and <i>Stargate</i>) served as presenters at the event where Fukunaga received a trophy and $3,000.

  The Student Academy Awards were established by the academy in 1972 to support and encourage excellence in filmmaking at the college level.<br>
