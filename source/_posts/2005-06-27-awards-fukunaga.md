UCSC alumnus Cary Fukunaga has been named a silver medal winner in the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences' 32nd annual Student Academy Awards competition. He was honored for his film _Victoria Para Chino_, a 14-minute narrative film based on the true story of the worst single case of illegal immigrant death in United States history.

Fukunaga graduated with a bachelor's degree in history from UCSC in 1999 prior to attending New York University, where he made the award-winning film.

He is one of 12 student winners from 11 different colleges and universities who participated in a week of industry-related activities and social events, culminating with a June 12 awards presentation ceremony at the academy's Samuel Goldwyn Theater. Cinematographers Caleb Deschanel, a five-time Oscar nominee (_The Passion of the Christ, The Patriot, Fly Away Home, The Natural, The Right Stuff_), and Karl Walter Lindenlaub (whose credits include _The Princess Diaries, The Haunting, Independence Day_, and _Stargate_) served as presenters at the event where Fukunaga received a trophy and $3,000.

The Student Academy Awards were established by the academy in 1972 to support and encourage excellence in filmmaking at the college level.
