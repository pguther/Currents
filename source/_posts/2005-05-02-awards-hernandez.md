Francisco J. Hernandez, vice chancellor of Student Affairs, is the author of an article that appears in the new book _Virtual Schools: Planning for Success_. Edited by Zane L. Berge and Tom Clark, _Virtual Schools_ is being published this month by Teachers College Press. The book provides an overview of virtual schooling and e-learning, along with detailed case studies and issues chapters. The book features chapters written by practitioners in the field, practical guidance and a brief "plan for success" roadmap for local schools interested in starting a virtual learning program, and chapters by leading experts on key aspects of virtual learning. Hernandez wrote the article titled "Equity and Access: The Promise of Virtual Schools."

In addition, Hernandez has been appointed to the executive committee of the [Western Cooperative for Educational Telecommunications][1] (WCET). He will serve through October 2006.

WCET is a membership-supported organization that was founded in 1989 by the Western Interstate Commission for Higher Education for providers and users of educational telecommunications. Members from higher education, nonprofit organizations, schools, and corporations represent some of the most innovative thinkers in the use of educational technologies today.
