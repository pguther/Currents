![][1]The July issue of _Pacific Horticulture_ magazine features an article by Arboretum manager **Brett Hall** and the Arboretum's founder and director emeritus **Ray Collett.** Hall and Collett's article, "Cape Heaths in Santa Cruz," includes beautiful photographs of the Arboretum's collection of _Erica_ species from South Africa. Many of the photos, including the cover photo for this issue, were taken by **Rose Hand,** an avid gardener and photographer who spent many years photographing the Arboretum's floral treasures. Hand died recently at the age of 85.
