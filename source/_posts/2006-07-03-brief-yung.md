Professor emerita of American studies Judy Yung will discuss her new book _Chinese American Voices: From the Gold Rush to the Present,_ at the Capitola Book Cafe (1475 41st Avenue) on Wednesday, July 12, at 7:30 p.m. Admission is free.

Fifteen years in the making, _Chinese American Voices_ is a diverse and illuminating collection of primary documents and stories by Chinese Americans from their arrival during the California gold rush to the present. Many of the letters, speeches, testimonies, oral histories, personal memoirs, poems, essays, and folksongs have never been published before, or have been translated into English for the first time. They bring to life the diverse voices of immigrants and the American-born; laborers, merchants, and professionals; ministers and students; housewives and prostitutes; and community leaders and activists.

_Chinese American Voices_ is coedited by Yung, Gordon H. Chang, and Him Mark Lai, and published by the University of California Press. Yung is the author of _Unbound Feet: A Social History of Chinese Women in San Francisco_.
