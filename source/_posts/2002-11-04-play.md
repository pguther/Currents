  It's a story you remember--done in a way you've never seen.<br>
  <i>Gretel &amp; Hansel: A New Twist on an Old Tail,</i> returns for its second Shakespeare Santa Cruz holiday season with a new director, different choreography, and a variety of new cast members.
</p>
<p>
  Bruce Wallace Hostetler, assistant producer for Ashland's renowned Oregon Shakespeare Festival, will make his Shakespeare Santa Cruz (SSC) directorial debut with the annual holiday production.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "It's a musical, it's funny, and it's fast-paced with lots of dancing and audience participation," Hostetler noted. "The play has changed since last year. We've tightened the script, cut some dialogue and songs, and added a new song. I think it's a better show this year. It's tighter and tells the story better."<br>
</p>
<p>
  That story includes a man in drag playing the wicked stepmother, a chorus of crows, and dancing cats.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "It's done in the English panto-style," explained Artistic Director Risa Brainin. "Panto is an English theatrical form that takes a fairy tale and turns it on its ear. It mixes musical theater with vaudeville and melodrama."<br>
</p>
<p>
  " I think most of all, it's irreverent," she added. "You know the basic story of Gretel &amp; Hansel, but you never know when the crows will break into song or a chorus of cats will perform a great dance number."<br>
</p>
<p>
  The original production was conceived and directed by SSC Artistic Director Paul Whitworth, now on a two-year sabbatical. Kate Hawley is the author, with music by award-winning composer Craig Bohmler. <i>Gretel &amp; Hansel</i> will run November 15 through December 15 at the UCSC Theater Arts Mainstage. The show is a collaboration between Shakespeare Santa Cruz and the UCSC Theater Arts Department.<br>
