<p>
  Campus police will be hosting a countywide day of stepped-up enforcement of traffic laws throughout campus on May 25.
</p>
<p>
  Dubbed "BADGES," for "Before Aggressive Drivers Get Everybody Stopped," the initiative will target pedestrians, drivers, and bicyclists, and include seat-belt violations and speeding. Police from neighboring jurisdictions, including the cities of Santa Cruz, Watsonville, Scotts Valley, and Capitola, as well as the California Highway Patrol, will participate in the stepped-up enforcement on the UCSC campus. Most of the officers will patrol on motorcyles.
