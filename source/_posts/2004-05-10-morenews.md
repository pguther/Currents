  <span class="sectionhead"><a name="workshop" id="workshop"></a>Organic Rose Workshop Saturday, May 15</span><br>
</p>
<p>
  Roses are one of the most popular plants in the home garden, but they are often considered impossible to grow without doses of chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Gardening expert Orin Martin thinks otherwise, and he'll share his techniques for choosing and growing roses without chemical inputs at a workshop on Saturday, May 15, from 10 a.m. to noon at the Alan Chadwick Garden, located on McLaughlin Drive across from Stevenson College.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Martin, who has managed the Chadwick Garden for more than 25 years, will discuss the importance of selecting disease-resistant rose varieties, following an aggressive pruning program, and using organically acceptable sprays such as dormant oil to prevent diseases. The historic Chadwick Garden currently supports a collection of approximately 125 roses representing 10-15 classes and 75 varieties.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Cost of the rose workshop is $10-$15 for members of the Friends of the UCSC Farm &amp; Garden (sliding scale); $15 general admission, payable the day of the event. For more information, call (831) 459-3240.<br>
