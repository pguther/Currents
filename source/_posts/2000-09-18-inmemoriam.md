  <font color="#000000"><b>Patrick Savageau,</b> a junior and a College Eight student, died September 4 of a fall while rock climbing in the Sierra Nevada; he was 20. Patrick's passion was rock climbing, and in the last two years he had achieved recognition as one of the best young climbers in the country. He planned to combine his interests in nature, climbing, and political science in a major in environmental studies. Patrick's family home is in Ann Arbor, Michigan, where services were held earlier this month. A campus memorial service is being planned; for more information, call Mary McKinnon at College Eight at (831) 459-5224.</font>
