  <font color="#003399">Fruit tree pruning workshop</font>
</h4>
<p>
  Fruit tree expert Orin Martin will offer you all the tips you need to prune your fruit trees successfully at a two-hour pruning workshop on Saturday, January 29, from 10 a.m. to noon. The class will be held at the Louise Cain Gatehouse on the Farm.<br>
  <br>
  <img align="right" border="0" height="128" src="../art/prune.175.jpg" width="175" alt="">Proper pruning will improve the health, appearance, and productivity of your fruit trees. Martin, who manages the Alan Chadwick Garden at UCSC, will cover numerous types of trees, including apple, pear, peach, and persimmon.<br>
  <br>
  Martin will give a talk and then demonstrate pruning techniques that are useful for backyard gardeners. He'll discuss pruning as part of the overall organic management of fruit trees and will field questions from participants. Key tips on the proper timing of pruning and how pruning can be used in tandem with other management techniques to fight disease will also be offered.<br>
  <br>
  The Louise Cain Gatehouse is located 1/4 mile up the gravel road above the Blacksmith Shop; free public parking is available across the street from the Blacksmith Shop in the Physical Plant parking lot.<br>
  <br>
  Fees for the workshop, which are payable the day of the class, are $10, or $5 for members of the Friends of the UCSC Farm &amp; Garden. Participants are encouraged to wear warm clothes; heavy rain cancels the event. For more information, call (831) 459-3248.
