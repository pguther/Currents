<p>
  A committee of eight distinguished academic administrators will visit UCSC February 2-4 in the closing phase of the Western Association of Schools and Colleges' (WASC) educational effectiveness review.
</p>
<p>
  During this visit, they will consult with administrators and faculty leadership to assess UCSC's commitment to "educational effectiveness" as defined in the WASC criteria for review and discuss several strategic issues with the campus leadership.
</p>
<p>
  Educational effectiveness within the framework of this review involves two things: whether students are successfully achieving the learning objectives of UCSC's programs and whether the institution has good processes for assessing and improving its effectiveness.
</p>
<p>
  Between Wednesday afternoon and Friday morning, there will be a series of meetings between members of the committee and groups of faculty, staff, and students who have been invited to address the particular topics that the visiting committee submitted to the campus last week.
</p>
<p>
  After the visit, the committee members, who have experience at both public and private research universities, will write a report to WASC about the visit and the campus review.
</p>
<p>
  UCSC administrators expect to see that report sometime in late March. After the report is made, the Western Association of Schools and Colleges' Commission will meet to approve the full review, taking action on UCSC's reaccreditation.
