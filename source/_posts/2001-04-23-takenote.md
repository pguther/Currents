#### ![Oakes College herb garden][1]Spring is the perfect time to visit the herb garden at Oakes College

Off the beaten path, at the southern edge of Oakes College across from the Provost's House, is a garden designed, developed, and maintained by Oakes groundskeepers Steven Hendrickson and Louis Dioszegi. Fenced to keep out deer, the garden has a wide variety of herbaceous perennials just beginning to burst into bloom after a dormant winter. The garden, which has benches, shade trees, and a view down the meadow to the ocean, is open for all to enjoy.

#### Summer day camp offers big fun at the UCSC Farm

The Wildlands and Watering Cans Summer Day Camp at the UCSC Farm offers hands-on gardening and wilderness activities for children ages 7 to 10. Each day will be filled with activities from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. A maximum of 24 campers will be enrolled for each weeklong session. Three sessions will be offered: June 25-29; July 9-13; and July 16-20. The curriculum will be repeated each week.

The camp is designed to foster environmental awareness while encouraging children to cooperate and have fun outside. Campers will create their own garden beds, explore insects and herbs, and make garden-based crafts. Campers will be exposed to organic farming practices such as composting and soil care, and they will help apprentices in the UCSC ecological horticulture program harvest vegetables for the weekly market. In addition, campers will enjoy local wilderness excursions that include tours of the UCSC Arboretum, the Pogonip Open Space Preserve, and Wilder Ranch.

Fees are $135/week for members of the Friends of the UCSC Farm & Garden and $150 for nonmembers. Call (831) 459-3240 for registration information.
