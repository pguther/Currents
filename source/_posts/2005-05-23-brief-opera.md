Don Juan, the legendary Spanish rogue and seducer, did get around in his day. Now the Don is coming to UCSC when the Music Department presents Mozart's Italian-language opera _Don Giovanni_, beginning on June 2 in the Music Center Recital Hall.

Considered by many to be Mozart's finest opera, _Don Giovanni_ is a successful combination of comic and dramatic opera. The work begins as Don Giovanni is leaving the bedroom of his latest conquest and ends with his descent into hell.

_Don Giovanni_ features the artistic efforts of an array of participants in addition to student performers: music lecturer Brian Staufenbiel directs; music professor Nicole Paiement conducts the UCSC Orchestra; lighting design is by Sylvie Vray; scenic design is by Legend Theatrical; costume design is by Marti Kranak; and wigs and makeup are by Jeanne Hurd. The opera will be sung in Italian with English supertitles.

John Dizikes, professor emeritus and author of _Opera in America,_ will present a preperformance talk before the final matinee performance on Sunday, June 5. The talk begins at 1:10 p.m. in the Music Center Recital Hall.

_Don Giovanni_ plays Thursday through Sunday, June 2-5 in the Music Center Recital Hall. Thursday, Friday, and Saturday performances are at 7:30 p.m.; Sunday's performance is at 2 p.m. Tickets are $18 general, $14 seniors, and $10 students. Seating is reserved. Tickets for the performance and the Dizikes talk are on sale at the UCSC Ticket Office (831) 459-2159.
