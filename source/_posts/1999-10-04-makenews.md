**The presidential campaign is in the news almost daily now, and **Dan Wirls** of politics fielded one of the early calls from the Associated Press about Al Gore's lead in California public opinion polls.

Economist **Bernie Elbaum** made a rare appearance in the press, being quoted in the _San Jose Mercury News_ recently about the stock market and the nation's economy.

Fellow economist **Michael Hutchison's** forthcoming book about financial policy and central banking in Japan received a nice write-up in _The Economist_ magazine, one of the most influential financial magazines in the world.

**Elaine Wheeler** of the UC College Prep Initiative spoke recently with a reporter from the _Chronicle of Higher Education_ about online high school courses.

The _Santa Cruz County Sentinel_ ran great action photos of Slug women's soccer team members **Ali Yarosevich** and **Kelly Garcia** nailing the ball in their win last week against Cal State Hayward, which brought their record to 8-1 for the season. The team, coached for the fourth year by Paul Lester, is ranked 18th in the NCAA Division III.
