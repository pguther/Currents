  Several service reductions are being implemented at the beginning of spring quarter to improve operating efficiencies and reduce operating costs.<br>

TAPS shuttle staff have confirmed that much of the remaining ridership occurs between on-campus destinations, with only minimal nightly ridership to off-campus destinations. Anecdotal information suggests several causes for this decline, including introduction of the "mandatory meal plan" program for all residential students, increased SCMTD transit service to Western Drive via Route 20 buses, and greater student use of Trader Joe's, the downtown New Leaf Market, and other commercial services in proximity to the Metro Center.<br>

  <b>Reduce night shuttle frequencies Friday, Saturday, and Sunday</b>. Night shuttle ridership on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday drops off dramatically when compared with Monday through Thursday nights. During February, Friday night ridership was 33 percent less than the seven-day nightly average, while Saturday and Sunday night ridership was nearly 70 percent below the seven-day nightly average. Moreover, TAPS shuttle staff have indicated that late night ridership (after 12:15 a.m.) on the Night Core route is "almost nonexistent."
