The University of California announced on December17 that an agreement made between UC and the California Nurses Association on a new two-year contract was officially ratified by UC nurses. A few days later, on December 22, UC officials announced that UC's research support professionals and technical employees had also voted to ratify a new contract, which extends through June 30, 2008.

Under the agreement with the nurses, UC was to give nurses four percent salary increases on January 1, 2006, in addition to the market increases UC gave nurses in September while still at the bargaining table. Other key issues regarding nurse staffing and patient lifting were also resolved. See full text of [UC press release][1].

Under the agreement with UC's research support professionals and technical employees, those employees will receive wage increases of approximately 12 percent over the next three years, contingent upon state funding, including three percent increases retroactive to October 1, 2005, along with a $220 signing bonus.
