  <a name="blumenthal" id="blumenthal"></a>William Ladusaw appointed interim vice provost and dean of undergraduate education
</p>
<p>
  William Ladusaw, professor of linguistics, has been appointed to the position of interim vice provost and dean of undergraduate education by Margaret L. Delaney, interim campus provost and executive vice chancellor. He will assume his new post July 1.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Ladusaw has extensive administrative experience, having previously served as chair of the Linguistics Department and provost of Cowell College, as well as on various administrative and Academic Senate committees. He recently served as a member of the Steering Committee for the new Academic Information Systems (AIS).<br>
</p>
<p>
  Ladusaw's research concerns linguistic semantics and pragmatics--the description of meaning in language, how it is related to grammatical structure, and how we understand what is said in context. He recently coauthored a book on the formal semantic analysis of non-Indo-European languages titled <i>Restriction and Saturation.</i>
