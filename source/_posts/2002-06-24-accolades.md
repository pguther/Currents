### Dana Takagi

Dana Takagi, associate professor of sociology, has been elected president of the Association for Asian American Studies (AAAS). Takagi, who took office in April, will serve a two-year term. The AASA's national conference will be held May 7-11, 2003, in San Francisco.

The Association for Asian American Studies was founded in 1979 to advance teaching and research in Asian American Studies and to promote closer ties between and among various sub-components within Asian American Studies, including Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Filipino, Hawai'ian, Southeast Asian, South Asian, Pacific Islander, and other groups. The association facilitates communication and scholarly exchange among teachers, researchers, and students and helps educate American society about the history and aspirations of Asian American ethnic minorities.
