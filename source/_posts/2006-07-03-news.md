**Bill Domhoff** of sociology was quoted in a _Washington Post_ article about U.S. society's fascination with conspiracy theories. Domhoff noted that for all their populist flavor, conspiracy theories usually end up attributing more power to elites than they actually have.

Also in sociology, **Ben Crow** was tapped by the _Concord_ (New Hampshire) _Monitor_ for comment about new water and electricity systems being developed for the Third World by Segway inventor Dean Kamen. Crow pointed out the social and political challenges of the world's water issues that have so far defied technological "quick fixes."

Research on earthquake aftershocks by seismologist **Emily Brodsky** was covered by _Science Letter, Life Science Weekly_, and other newsletters.

In an article about widespread economic anxiety in the United States, _U. S. News & World Report_ honed in on economist **Lori Kletzer**'s proposal for a wage insurance program.

Film and digital media professor **Chip Lord** was quoted in a _Dwell_ magazine cover story on radical architecture about the innovative Ant Farm art and architecture collective he cofounded in 1968. In addition, Lord and **Margaret Morse**, also a professor of film and digital media, were quoted in a _Metro Santa Cruz_ article about experimental art at UCSC.

The _Santa Cruz Sentinel_ ran a lengthy Q&A with UCSC's new athletic director, **Linda Spradley,** on the front page of the sports section.

The author of an editor's note in the _Los Angeles Times_ turned to **Patricia Zavella** of Latin American and Latino studies for insight into the use of the word _mojado_ in an article. The word, Spanish for "wetback," has increasingly been adopted by undocumented immigrants as a badge of honor, said Zavella.

Genomic research by **Gil Bejerano** and others in UCSC's Center for Biomolecular Science and Engineering was covered in _Genomics and Genetics Weekly, Health & Medicine Week, Biotech Week, Science Letter_, and other newsletters.

Psychology instructor **Veronica Tonay** was featured in an _Oregonian_ article about the meaning of dreams.
