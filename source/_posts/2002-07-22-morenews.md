</p>
<p>
  During the past year, the National Science Foundation (NSF) has awarded three grants to professor of Earth sciences James Gill for studies of active volcanoes. The most recent is for research at Arenal Volcano, Costa Rica, a site also being studied by professor of Earth sciences Susan Schwartz. After some 500 years of quiescence, Arenal erupted explosively in 1968, killing 78 people, and has been continuously active since then. Gill is investigating the factors underlying complex changes that have occured during the ongoing eruption of Arenal Volcano.
</p>
<p>
  The project involves a collaboration with researchers at the Universities of Illinois, Iowa, and Alaska, including three of Gill's former Ph.D. students. The other two NSF awards are for studies of volcanoes on land and under the sea in Japan, where Gill will spend fall quarter 2002. Gill served as vice chancellor for research from 1994 to 2000.<br>

  Preparation work for the new UCSC Engineering Building will prompt the closing of Lot 139, the lot behind Baskin Engineering Building. The lot is expected to close on July 25 or 26, and remain closed, with the contractor likely to break ground on the new building in August. New handicapped spaces are being established and will be available for those who require them. There will also be some spaces reserved for university and service vehicles. Others should plan to park in the Core West Parking Structure or Lot 150, which is also known as the North Perimeter Lot. Guests to the campus may use pay station spaces at the parking structure. <a href="../../construction.html">Construction update story</a>

  <a name="Draft" id="Draft"></a>Draft on housing policies to be posted before fall public forum
</p>
<p>
  The committee looking at policies for university-owned housing for faculty and staff plans to have a draft recommendation ready two weeks before the next public forum, tentatively scheduled for mid-September. That draft will be posted on the <a href="http://planning.ucsc.edu/pac/cwc.html">Campus Welfare Committee web site.</a>
</p>
<p>
  The Campus Welfare Committee is meeting throughout the summer and plans to make a recommendation in early October to John Simpson, campus provost and executive vice chancellor. Simpson had initially directed the committee to make a recommendation on housing by June 15, but the committee requested more time to gather information and receive input from the campus community, said Assistant Chancellor Leslie Sunell, the committee chair. A campus forum on housing was held May 20. Several suggestions for determining who should receive priority for housing were discussed.<br>
</p>
<p>
  In August, the Campus Welfare Committee will receive the results of an independent survey of demand for university-sponsored housing among faculty and staff. The committee is now working on a concept paper to be used in further discussion with the campus community in the fall.
