  <font size="5"><b>Staff give a 'thumbs up' to breakfast with the chancellor</b></font>
</p>
<p>
  Free food, music, and friends. What more could a UCSC staffer want? Maybe a little extra cash in the wallet?<br>
</p><br>
As if reading their minds, that's exactly what Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood told staff at last week's "Thank Goodness for Staff" breakfast that she hopes to provide.
<p>
  In an unexpected announcement, Greenwood told nearly 700 campus employees who turned out to enjoy "Pancakes and Jazz with M.R.C." about her intention to give staff employees awards of up to $300.
</p>
<p>
  Although the arrangements haven't been finalized, Greenwood said she is optimistic that all career, partial-year career, contract, and limited (formerly known as casual) staff employees will receive a one-time award for up to $300 near the end of this fiscal year. Greenwood explained that the funds are from the Awards and Recognition Program, and that full-time employees would be eligible for the maximum of $300, while part-timers would receive an amount prorated to the percentage time they work.
</p>
<p>
  The awards are intended to recognize the contributions staff employees make to accommodating campus growth and to ensure continued excellence toward the realization of UCSC's millennium goals. Ineligible employees include those with academic, student, and senior management appointments.
</p>
<p>
  Before the proposal can be finalized and put into action, the campus must meet its obligations to notify various union representatives, noted Willeen McQuitta, director of Staff Human Resources. The future use of Awards and Recognition Program funds is being discussed, she added.
</p>
<p>
  Greenwood's announcement, as well as the melodic tunes provided by the jazz trio Euphonic Tonic, contributed to an upbeat mood as staffers gathered in the Stevenson Dining Hall and on the patio to fill up on a lavish breakfast of eggs, pancakes, sausage, bacon, tofu scramble, pastries, potatoes, fresh fruit, and more. The buffet won rave reviews.
</p>
<p>
  "We need our breakfast in the morning to get us going!" exclaimed senior custodian Jackie Baeza, who enjoyed the spread with her colleagues Halina Kubis and Bea Jantz.
</p>
<p>
  Helen Mayer, program coordinator at the Women's Center, was impressed by the turnout. "It's like everybody has come out of the woodwork," she said. "It's great."
</p>
<p>
  Greenwood and other campus administrators donned yellow-and-blue "Thank Goodness for Staff" T-shirts as they mingled with the crowd.
</p>
<p>
  "It feels more intimate being in this kind of space rather than on the big field," said groundskeeper Darien Rice, who had breakfast with friends on the patio. "And there's plenty to eat!"
</p>
<p>
  Lucky members of the crowd won prizes that included T-shirts, wine, commuter mugs, monthlong parking passes, recreation passes, and more.
</p>
<p>
  The breakfast was organized by the UCSC Staff Advisory Board. Ryan Andrews, manager of the Fitness Center and a newcomer to the board, suggested the jazz trio after it performed at an East Field House event earlier this year. Drummer Bobby Stadler is a UCSC student about to graduate with a degree in environmental studies. He and fellow musicians Steve Armstrong on guitar and Steve Steele on bass entertained the crowd for two hours.
</p>
<p>
  "It was good to have this," said Linda Biancalana, who works for Physical Plant. "It's good to get together in the morning. People are chipper. Look, everybody came!"
