By all accounts, the grand opening of the Seymour Center at Long Marine Laboratory on March 11 and 12 was a huge success. More than 2,000 people visited the center on each day of the grand opening weekend for a total of about 4,500 visitors.

The Ocean Discovery Shop did brisk business, selling out of some of the most popular items. And the Friends of Long Marine Lab signed up 163 new members over the weekend, said Lisa Rose, executive director of the friends group, which helps support the Seymour Center and other programs at the lab.   
  
The burst of activity at the Seymour Center continued right into the following week and shows no signs of slowing down. "We are still really busy," Rose said.  
  
The center's programs for school groups are fully booked through the end of the school year, said center director Julie Barrett Heffington.   
  
The Seymour Center is open Tuesday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and Sunday from noon to 5 p.m. Admission is $5 for adults; $3 for students, seniors, and youth (ages 6 to 16); and free for children age 5 and under. Admission is free for members.
