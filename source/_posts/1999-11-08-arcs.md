The Northern California chapter of the Achievement Rewards for College Scientists (ARCS) Foundation has provided $60,000 in scholarships this year for eight UCSC students. The 1999 ARCS scholars were honored at the foundation's annual luncheon November 2 at the St. Francis Hotel in San Francisco. The ARCS Foundation is a national organization that provides scholarships and fellowships for the country's most promising science, medical, and engineering students. The foundation is the most generous provider of annual student awards to the UCSC campus. The 1999 ARCS scholars represent the departments of Earth Sciences, Biology, Astronomy and Astrophysics, Ocean Sciences/Environmental Toxicology, and Science Communication. Four UCSC graduate students received $10,000 ARCS scholarships: Mark Clementz (earth sciences), Jonna Diane Engel (biology), Anthony Gonzalez (astronomy and astrophysics), and Allison Luengen (Ocean Sciences/ETox). Four students in the Science Communication Program each received a $5,000 ARCS scholarship, plus a $5,000 personal donation from Mrs. Marion Cope. They are Margaret McKee, Jessa Forte Netting, Emily Sohn, and Catherine Zandonella. Mrs. Cope is a board member of the ARCS Foundation, a trustee of the UC Santa Cruz Foundation, and a longtime supporter of the Science Communication Program.
