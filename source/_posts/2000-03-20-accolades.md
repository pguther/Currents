**Lydia Gregoret**

![][1]The Biophysical Society has awarded Lydia Gregoret, assistant professor of chemistry and biochemistry, the Margaret Oakley Dayhoff Award for 2000. The award honors the memory of Margaret Dayhoff, former president of the Biophysical Society, professor of biophysics at Georgetown University, and director of research at the National Biomedical Research Foundation.   
  
The award, which includes a $2,000 prize, is presented each year to a woman scientist "of very high promise who has not yet reached a position of high recognition."   
  
Gregoret's research addresses the problem of how protein molecules fold into the complex shapes that help determine their special properties. "I am extremely honored to receive an award named for Margaret Dayhoff, since I consider her one of the pioneers of my field," Gregoret said.  
  
Margaret Dayhoff's husband, Edward Dayhoff, presented the award to Gregoret in February at the Biophysical Society's annual meeting. "[Gregoret's] recent papers represent conceptually groundbreaking work and are expected to be a powerful tool for answering the question of how amino acid sequences of proteins determine their three-dimensional structures," he said.

#### **Danny Scheie**

Associate professor of theater arts Danny Scheie has been nominated for a Bay Area Critic's Circle Award in directing and also recently received the Dean Goodman Award for his production of _As Bees in Honey Drown_ at Theatreworks in Mountain View. This winter Scheie revived his hit production of Shakespeare's _The Comedy of Errors _(originally produced by Shakespeare Santa Cruz) at Berkeley's Aurora Theatre Company to critical acclaim. The production also featured UCSC alumna Susannah Schulman.
