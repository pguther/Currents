  The African American Theater Arts Troupe begins its ninth season with a production of <i>A Long Time Since Yesterday</i> by award-winning playwright P. J. Gibson.
</p>Gibson is the author of more than a dozen plays. <i>Long Time</i>, written in 1985, is the story of five sorority sisters who reunite 20 years after college at the suburban home of a classmate who has just committed suicide. The play addresses issues of race, sex, politics, and gender, using insight, humor, and song. The play contains adult language.<br>
<br>
Shows take place at UCSC's Second Stage at 8 p.m. on Friday, February 18th, and Saturday, February 19, and at 3 p.m. on Sunday, February 20. Performances will also take place at the Louden Nelson Community Center at 8 p.m. on Friday, February 25, and Saturday, February 26.<br>
<br>
The African American Theater Arts Troupe was established in 1991 with the purpose of fostering diversity on the campus and in the community. Each year, led by director Don Williams, the troupe of UCSC students performs works about people of color to the campus and the community.<br>
<br>
The troupe also provides scholarships to five UCSC students annually. Since it was formed, the African American Theater Arts Troupe has awarded more than $35,000 in scholarships. This year the troupe is aiming to raise $12,000 through performances and donations. Scholarships are awarded on the basis of merit and need, with priority given to troupe members and theater arts students.<br>
<br>
