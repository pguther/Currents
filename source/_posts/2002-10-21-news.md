UCSC in the News

**David Wellman** of community studies was tapped by the _New York Times_ for comment about President Bush's intervention in the labor conflict at West Coast ports.

**Forrest Robinson**, professor of American studies, was interviewed on KSCO Radio during the national "Banned Books Week." Robinson has written, taught, and lectured on _Huckleberry Finn,_ one of the most frequently banned books in American history.

_USA Today_ quoted psychology's** Craig Haney** on the risk of describing the killer terrorizing the Washington, D.C., area as "cowardly," saying it's a "bit of a gamble" to hope that angering the assailant will prompt an ill-considered move that will aid law enforcement efforts.

The work of **Alva Noe,** associate professor of philosophy, was cited in _New Scientist_ magazine. Noe, along with psychologist Kevin O'Regan of the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique, argues for a "sensorimotor theory of vision," which the _New Scientist_ article called "dramatically different from exiting theories of perception."

Political scientist **Dan Wirls** provided analysis for _Salon.com_ of a recent speech by President Bush, in which Bush relaunched a "kindler, gentler" rationale for his administration's policy on Iraq.

"Art of the Lega: Meaning and Metaphor in Central Africa," an exhibit curated by assistant professor of art history **Elisabeth Cameron,** was reviewed in the _Kansas City Star_.

_Pagan Time: An American Childhood,_ by **Micah Perks**, assistant professor of literature, was reviewed in the _Santa Fe New Mexican._ Perks's memoir was described as "vibrantly written, amusing, at times astonishing" by the reviewer.  

The _Santa Cruz Sentinel_ did a retrospective on the contributions of graduates of the **Center for Agroecology**'s apprenticeship program, highlighting the accomplishments of several alumni. Pacific Grove-based KAZU Radio produced a feature about the apprenticeship in organic horticulture, too, and the station interviewed **Paul Ortiz** of community studies about his book of oral histories told by African Americans who had lived in the segregated South.
