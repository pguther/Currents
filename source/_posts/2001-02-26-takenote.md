#### ![][2]Sweet News: See's chocolates are back!

Help support the Women at Work Retreat Scholarship Fund by purchasing See's chocolate bars in four delicious flavors. The W@W 2001 Steering Committee is looking for volunteers to help with sales. It's easy--it sells itself; it's fun-- people love you when you have chocolate; and it's for a great cause.
