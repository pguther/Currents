  <font color="#003399"><b>R. Michael Tanner</b></font>
</p>
<p>
  Professor of computer science R. Michael Tanner has been named a Fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). Election to IEEE Fellow is one of the institute's most prestigious honors. In electing Tanner, the IEEE Board of Directors cited him "for contributions to the theory and practice of error-control codes."<br>
  <br>
  Tanner's research interests include information theory, error-control codes, iterative algorithms on graphs, and fault-tolerance. Recognized as the founder of "codes on graphs," he was awarded the 50th anniversary "Golden Jubilee Award" by the Information Society of the IEEE for his 1981 paper, "A Recursive Approach to Low-Complexity Codes."<br>
  <br>
  In 1998, after serving in a series of administrative positions at UCSC for nearly a decade, Tanner left the position of executive vice chancellor to return to his research and scholarly pursuits.

  Chad Sanger, advising and records coordinator at College Eight, has been elected cochair of the UC Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Association (UCLGBTA). He facilitated his first meeting as cochair at the association's annual conference in February. Sanger will serve in this position until spring 2001.<br>
  <br>
  The UCLGBTA is the UC-systemwide LGBT organization supporting and promoting the interests of the UC community with respect to its diverse sexual and/or gender orientations. Current issues being addressed include extending domestic partnership benefits in housing and pension benefits and responding to campus hate/bias incidents.<br>
  <br>
  Sanger has long been an advocate for LGBT issues. As a Porter student, he helped found the Porter Lavender Lounge and was active in many campuswide queer organizations. As a staff member, Sanger has served on the GLBT Campus Concerns Committee, and he currently cochairs the Chancellor's Advisory Committee. In 1998 he cochaired the UCLBTA annual conference, "Exposed," which drew over 500 participants to UCSC.<br>
