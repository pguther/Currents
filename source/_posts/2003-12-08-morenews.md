Surf Industry grant supports Seymour Marine Discovery Center   
  
The [Seymour Center][3] at Long Marine Laboratory has received a grant of $8,000 from the [Surf Industry Manufacturer's Association][4] (SIMA) to support its education programs in 2004. SIMA announced the award--one of eight grants to ocean conservation groups--last week.   

The Seymour Center will use the grant to support efforts to educate young people about the role marine science plays in understanding and conserving the world's oceans, said center director Julie Barrett Heffington. The center offers a wide range of school programs, a summer youth program ("Ocean Explorers"), and year-round youth and family programs.   

"This is a great gift for us. It will support important programs and help us bring students from kindergarten through community college to the Seymour Center to explore the ocean environment right outside our doors," Heffington said.   

The SIMA Environmental Fund made grants totalling $320,000 to select ocean conservation groups for 2004. The funds were raised at the organization's annual Waterman's Weekend environmental fundraising event in August. The Seymour Center is the only new grant recipient this year, joining a group of organizations that have received past awards from SIMA.   

The SIMA Environmental Fund is a nonprofit foundation formed by the surf industry to provide grant support to environmental organizations.
