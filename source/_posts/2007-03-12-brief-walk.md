UCSC's [Student Health Outreach and Promotion][1] program (SHOP) is joining with the Santa Cruz AIDS Project to promote the 17th Annual AIDS Walk on Saturday, April 14.

The Wharf to Bridges 10K AIDS Walk will start at the Wharf and proceed along West Cliff, with Natural Bridges serving as the turnaround point.

Participants are encouraged to collect a minimum of $100 to receive the AIDS Walk shirt, and teams of three or more will compete for prizes for highest donations. The t-shirts will entitle participants to discounts at Wharf businesses that day. Those who complete the walk will also get free tokens for Laser Tag or miniature golf at the Boardwalk.

Registration and a light breakfast will be begin at 9:30 a.m. at the Wharf, followed by a warmup to get ready to walk. The walk starts at 11 a.m., and concludes with an after-party featuring refreshments and entertainment on the Wharf.

To download a pledge form and learn how to build a team for the walk, go to the [AIDS Walk web site][2] , or call the SHOP program at (831) 459-3772.
