  UCSC's <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/healthcenter/shop/">Student Health Outreach and Promotion</a> program (SHOP) is joining with the Santa Cruz AIDS Project to promote the 17th Annual AIDS Walk on Saturday, April 14.
</p>
<p>
  The Wharf to Bridges 10K AIDS Walk will start at the Wharf and proceed along West Cliff, with Natural Bridges serving as the turnaround point.
</p>

  Participants are encouraged to collect a minimum of $100 to receive the AIDS Walk shirt, and teams of three or more will compete for prizes for highest donations. The t-shirts will entitle participants to discounts at Wharf businesses that day. Those who complete the walk will also get free tokens for Laser Tag or miniature golf at the Boardwalk.
</p>
<p>
  Registration and a light breakfast will be begin at 9:30 a.m. at the Wharf, followed by a warmup to get ready to walk. The walk starts at 11 a.m., and concludes with an after-party featuring refreshments and entertainment on the Wharf.
