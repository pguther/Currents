  Lecturer Susanne Jonas of Latin American and Latino studies was an invited featured speaker at a conference in Barcelona on the 10th anniversary of the signing of the Guatemalan Peace Accords.

  The three-day conference in November was sponsored by the Autonomous University of Barcelona, with support from the Foreign Ministry of Spain and the state government of Catalunya. About 50 people were invited, including key Guatemalan participants during the peace process, a number of representatives from the United Nations, and many people from Spain, including academics and several people from the top ranks of the diplomatic service.
