  Assistant theater arts professor Alma Martinez has been awarded a Fulbright Scholar grant to conduct research and lecture at La Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru in Lima during the 2006-07 academic year. Martinez will work with Grupo Cultural Yuyachkani, one of the oldest and most important popular theater companies in Latin America. She will also lecture on the subject of the interconnectivity of Teatro Chicano in the U.S. and the New Popular Theatre (Nuevo Teatro Popular) in Latin America.
</p>
<p>
  Martinez is one of approximately 800 U.S. faculty and professionals who will travel abroad to some 140 countries during 2006-07 through the Fulbright Scholar Program. Established in 1946 under legislation introduced by the late Senator J. William Fulbright of Arkansas, the program aims to build mutual understanding between the people of the United States and other countries.
</p>
<p>
  Recipients of Fulbright Scholar awards are selected on the basis of academic or professional achievement and because they have demonstrated extraordinary leadership potential in their fields. Among the thousands of prominent Fulbright Scholar alumni are Milton Friedman, Nobel Prize-winning economist; Alan Leshner, CEO of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS); Rita Dove, Pulitzer Prize-winning poet; and Craig Barrett, CEO of Intel Corporation.
