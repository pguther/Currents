**Assistant Professor of Ocean Sciences  
  
Raphael Kudela's research interests include ecological modeling, remote sensing and satellite oceanography, phytoplankton ecology, and harmful algal blooms. He uses remote sensing data from satellites to model plant growth in the ocean, and he is also studying how nutrients affect harmful algal blooms in Monterey Bay. Kudela received a B.S. in biology and marine science from Drake University and a Ph.D. in biological oceanography from the University of Southern California. Before joining the UCSC faculty, he was an associate research scientist at San Francisco State University and also held postdoctoral positions at Los Alamos National Laboratory and the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI). He remains affiliated with MBARI as a visiting scientist.

**Professor of Ocean Sciences  
  
Jonathan Zehr studies the microbial ecology of aquatic communities in oceans and lakes. His interests include the fixation of nitrogen from the atmosphere by cyanobacteria (blue-green algae) in the open ocean and the molecular biology of nitrogen fixation in aquatic environments. He is also involved in a collaborative study of the microbial ecology of Mono Lake. Zehr received a B.S. in biology from Western Washington University in Bellingham and a Ph.D. in ecology-limnology from UC Davis. Before joining the UCSC faculty, Zehr was an associate professor of biology at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York.
