### Audrey Stanley, Shakespeare Santa Cruz

Audrey Stanley, professor emerita of theater arts and founding artistic director of Shakespeare Santa Cruz (SSC), was one of eight members of the Santa Cruz arts community to receive a 2002 Gail Rich Award. The sixth annual Gail Rich Awards presentation took place on January 25 at the Kuumbwa Jazz Center in Santa Cruz.

Named in honor of the late Gail Rich, a tireless advocate and volunteer on behalf of the arts, the awards are meant as an appreciation of the individuals who make up Santa Cruz County's arts community. The winners are chosen by the _Santa Cruz_ _Sentinel,_ in partnership with the Cultural Council Associates and the Cultural Council of Santa Cruz County.

Two other individuals associated with SSC also received Gail Rich Awards: Suzanne Schrag, an actress and improv comic, who played one of the "Weird Sisters" in last season's _Macbeth,_ and Jim Urban, a visual artist known for his billboard art displayed on UCSC's Barn Theater as well as the SSC season image banners that are displayed at the Theater Arts Center during the festival.

The Theatre Communications Group (TCG) announced the recipients and finalists of the 2001 NEA/TCG Career Development Programs for Directors and Designers, and of the 29 recipients, four are UCSC graduates and three have worked with Shakespeare Santa Cruz. One of the winners, Robby Maclean, was the composer/sound designer for SSC's 2001 production of _Macbeth._ Theatre Communications Group (TCG) is a national service organization that exists to strengthen, nurture, and promote not-for-profit American theater.
