<p>
  <i>Sportsmen &amp; Gamesmen,</i> a collection of biographical sketches of 19th-century Americans by John Dizikes, has just been published in a new edition by the University of Missouri Press.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Dizikes, professor emeritus of American studies, draws the distinction between sportsmen who play the game for itself, and gamesman who are trying to achieve something outside the game.<br>
</p>
<p>
  From Andrew Jackson to P. T. Barnum, <i>Sportsmen &amp; Gamesmen</i> tells the stories of Americans involved in popular sporting life. At the time of the volume's initial publication in 1981, the <i>New York Times</i> wrote "It's a pleasure to meet some of the less familiar sporting and gaming figures that Mr. Dizikes introduces in his volume."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Included in the collection are James Cox Stevens, whose winning yacht, <i>America,</i> lent its name to the sailing prize cup after its victory in the initial race; the brilliant chess player Paul Morphy who went mad; and the tale of a pugilist and his girlfriend, John C. Heenan and Adah Menken.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Through the lives he describes, Dizikes also reveals 19th-century American culture, and the gradual process of creating an American sporting culture distinct from the British aristocratic sporting tradition.
