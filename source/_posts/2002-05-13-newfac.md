**Lewis Watts  
**Assistant Professor, Art  
  

Lewis Watts's research and artwork center on the photography of African American cultural landscapes, where people live, how they occupy and use space, and the traces they leave behind. He is interested in the cultural roots of architecture and both the intentional and unintentional manipulation of space.  
  
Watts has worked extensively as a photographer, archivist, and curator on many projects involving documentation of architecture and architectural preservation, visual history, educational materials, fine-arts projects, and portraiture. His most recent solo exhibition is "Photography by Lewis Watts," at the Bolinas Museum, Bolinas, California. Selected photographs from an earlier exhibition, "[South to West Oakland,][1]" at Robert B. Menschel Photography Gallery, Syracuse, New York, are available online.  
  
Watts joins the faculty at UCSC after 25 years of teaching at UC Berkeley. He has a B.A. in political science and an M.A. in photography and design from UC Berkeley.
