The new Housing Access Policy follows nearly a year of discussion and analysis by the [Campus Welfare Committee][1].

In March 2002, Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor John Simpson charged the committee with revisiting the for-sale and for-lease priority systems and recommending a uniform policy on both programs.

Simpson wanted the systems to be fair to those presently on waiting lists while incorporating the needs of faculty and staff yet to come to the campus.  

The committee sought public input at two campus forums on housing, and also received input from the Academic Senate Committee on Faculty Welfare and the Staff Advisory Board. Comments and ideas from the campus community were also sought via e-mail during the process.  

The Housing Access Policy was approved by Simpson on May 22. At the Campus Welfare Committee's recommendation, Simpson set the percentages for allocation by employee groups.  

The Campus Welfare Committee's proposal to allocate a percentage of housing stock to staff and non-senate academics is noteworthy within the UC system; UCSC is apparently the first UC to dedicate a percentage of the employee housing stock to staff, Faculty and Staff Housing manager Steve Houser said.
