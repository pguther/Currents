  Ronald Ruby, Professor Emeritus of Physics
</p>
<p>
  Ronald H. Ruby, professor emeritus of physics, died in Santa Cruz on November 5. He was 70 years old.<br>

  Ruby came to UC Santa Cruz in 1965, one of the first faculty members hired by the newly established Cowell College. He conducted research in biophysics, focusing on the physics of photosynthesis. He was also known for his innovative and zestful approach to teaching.<br>
