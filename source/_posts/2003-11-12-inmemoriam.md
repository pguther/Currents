In Memoriam

Ronald Ruby, Professor Emeritus of Physics

Ronald H. Ruby, professor emeritus of physics, died in Santa Cruz on November 5. He was 70 years old.  

Ruby came to UC Santa Cruz in 1965, one of the first faculty members hired by the newly established Cowell College. He conducted research in biophysics, focusing on the physics of photosynthesis. He was also known for his innovative and zestful approach to teaching.  

Ruby's involvement in campus activities ranged from participation in long range planning efforts to coaching the rugby team. He served as chair of the Physics Board of Studies, chair of the Academic Senate, and associate dean of natural sciences. Ruby retired from UCSC in 1991.

A memorial service will be held at 2 p.m. on November 23, at the Cowell College Library. An annual award will be established in Ruby's name for excellence in teaching the natural sciences at UCSC. Donations can be sent to: UC Santa Cruz Foundation - Ruby Award, University Relations, Attn: Gift Administration, Carriage House, UCSC, 1156 High Street, Santa Cruz, CA 95064.
