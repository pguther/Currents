Marine scientists involved in a major study of coastal ecosystems on the West Coast are hosting a Public Symposium on Sunday, March 10, to present findings from their first three years of research. Researchers, managers, ocean enthusiasts, and the general public are invited to attend and learn about recent progress from the Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans (PISCO).

The symposium will take place from 12 noon to 5 p.m. at California State University, Monterey Bay, in the University Center on Sixth Avenue. Registration is free at the event; no preregistration is necessary.  
  
PISCO involves researchers from four major universities in California and Oregon and is dedicated to advancing the understanding of shallow-water, rocky-shore ecosystems along the West Coast of the United States. PISCO's partner institutions are UCSC, UC Santa Barbara, Oregon State University, and Stanford University, Hopkins Marine Station.  
  
The symposium will include informative presentations by well-known marine scientists; an array of posters highlighting PISCO research along the West Coast; and opportunities to ask questions and share ideas with PISCO scientists.  
  
Speakers will include PISCO principal investigators Peter Raimondi and Mark Carr, both associate professors of ecology and evolutionary biology at UCSC; Bill Douros, superintendent of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary; George Somero, director of the Hopkins Marine Station and a PISCO principal investigator; and Jenn Caselle, PISCO science coordinator, UC Santa Barbara.  
  
For more information, [e-mail][1] or call Lydia Bergen, PISCO policy coordinator at UCSC, at (831) 459-5022. Additional information about PISCO is available on the [web][2]. PISCO is funded by the David and Lucile Packard Foundation.
