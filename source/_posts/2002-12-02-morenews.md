<p>
  In response to the bombing attacks that killed nearly 200 people in Bali and wiped out a huge area of Kuta Beach, the Santa Cruz community gathered for a gala "Bali Crisis Relief" dinner and benefit performance at Louden Nelson Center November 9.

The benefit was a huge success, raising nearly $11,000.
