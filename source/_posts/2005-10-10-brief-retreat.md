A kickoff meeting to plan the 2006 Women at Work Retreat will be held Thursday, October 13, from noon to 1 p.m. in Bay Tree Room C.

The 20th annual Women at Work Retreat will be held April 27-28 at the St. Francis Retreat Center in San Juan Bautista. This year's theme is "The First 20 Years: Celebrating the Past, Preparing for the Future."

Participants may contribute a little--or a lot--of their time, ideas and/or energy to any of several committees, including:

* **Hospitality.** Help everyone get acquainted and have fun.
* **Programming.** Help find speakers and plan relevant programs and discussions.
* **Fundraising.** Help with traditional and new ways to raise funds for this event.
* **Diversity/Outreach.** Help with outreach and programming to create a culturally inclusive experience for everyone.
