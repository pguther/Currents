**Donald Smith,** associate professor of environmental toxicology, was quoted by a _San Jose Mercury News_ reporter who sought his comments on a study suggesting that Beethoven suffered from lead poisoning based on an analysis of the composer's hair. Smith said the conclusions were interesting if true, but noted that it would be hard to prove that the hair sample was not contaminated with lead from an external source.

**Peggy Downes Baskin** of women's studies was interviewed by TV Channel 7 in Philadelphia about the concept of mentoring into mid-life in conjunction with her participation in a national conference on The Spirit of Women, which took place in Philadelphia. She was a keynote speaker at the conference along with authors Gail Sheehy, Matilda Cuomo, Kerry Kennedy, and Ilene Tuttle.   
  
A new book called _Science at the Extreme,_ by Peter Taylor, includes a chapter on **Brian Latta,** a research biologist with the Santa Cruz Predatory Bird Research Group. Latta's work with peregrine falcons includes climbing on buildings, bridges, and cliffs to reach their nests. Latta was also featured in _Outside_ magazine and appeared in a recently taped segment of the TV show _To Tell the Truth._
