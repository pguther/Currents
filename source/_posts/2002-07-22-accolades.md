Accolades

Association of University Architects elects Frank Zwart president

Frank Zwart, UCSC campus architect and associate vice chancellor for physical planning and construction, will serve as president of the [Association of University Architects][1] (AUA) for the 2002-03 year. He held the position of vice president in 2001-02 and secretary/treasurer in 2000-01.

The AUA provides a forum for campus architects to communicate and exchange ideas. Its membership is limited to licensed architects who have professional responsibility for the physical development of a campus or of a multicampus university or college system.

The Association of University Architects was founded in Chicago in June 1955\. The University of California has been active in the AUA since its earliest days. Robert J. Evans, then UC-systemwide University Architect, was the founding president, and campus architects from Berkeley, UCLA, Irvine, San Diego, and (now) Santa Cruz have served as president. Currently the AUA has 133 regular and affiliate members and 56 emeritus members.  

Zwart was elected president at the AUA annual meeting in June, which was co-hosted by Virginia Commonwealth University and the University of Richmond, in Richmond, Virginia.
