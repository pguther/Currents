New law affects campus business practices

New California legislation known as SB 1467, which took effect July 1, significantly changes certain business practices at UCSC. Specifically, SB 1467 restricts the ability of departments to purchase, lease, or rent goods or services from university employees. Because of the severity of the penalties for violating the new law, it's imperative that all employees understand and comply with SB 1467.  
  
Departments contemplating transactions involving employee vendors, or employees who have been asked to provide goods or services to UCSC should review the following briefing documents which explain in greater detail changes at UC resulting from SB 1467.
