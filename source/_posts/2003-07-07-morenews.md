  <a name="law" id="law"></a><span class="sectionhead">New law affects campus business practices</span>
</p>
<p>
  New California legislation known as SB 1467, which took effect July 1, significantly changes certain business practices at UCSC. Specifically, SB 1467 restricts the ability of departments to purchase, lease, or rent goods or services from university employees. Because of the severity of the penalties for violating the new law, it's imperative that all employees understand and comply with SB 1467.<br>
  <br>
  Departments contemplating transactions involving employee vendors, or employees who have been asked to provide goods or services to UCSC should review the following briefing documents which explain in greater detail changes at UC resulting from SB 1467.

</p>
<p>
  University of California campuses have admitted 14,665 transfer students from California community colleges for fall 2003, 7.6 percent more than in 2002. It is the fifth consecutive year with universitywide growth in the number of transfer students.<br>
</p>
<p>
  UC campuses accepted almost eight out of 10 transfer applicants.<br>
</p>
<p>
  California residents accounted for 13,415 of the transfers, 7.2 percent more than in 2002.<br>
</p>
<p>
  All major racial and ethnic groups registered systemwide increases. Underrepresented students (African American, American Indian, and Chicano/Latino) increased modestly as a proportion of the total admitted transfer class from 17.8 percent in 2002 to 18.5 percent in 2003. Underrepresented students also increased as a proportion of California resident transfers, up from 19.4 percent in 2002 to 20.4 percent in 2003.
