In early October, more than 70 faculty, staff, and students gathered at a Porter College courtyard for an inaugural celebration of UCSC's new [Institute for Humanities Research][1] (IHR).   
  
The festive mood of the reception turned even more celebratory following surprise announcements of additional funding to the center. Humanities Dean Wlad Godzich promised to earmark $60,000 over the next three years to support a distinguished lecturer series and, in another surprise announcement, Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor John Simpson pledged $38,000 to the IHR for graduate student support.  
  
The IHR was created in 1999 to support humanities faculty and graduate student research and academic programming. The IHR is also the home of the internationally renowned Center for Cultural Studies, one of the nation's premiere centers of interdisciplinary research. IHR also supports Focused Research Activities in Feminism, Mind and Meaning, and Pre- and Early Modern Studies (PEMS).   
  
The October 4 reception featured a keynote address from Judith Butler, the Chancellor's Professor of Rhetoric and Comparative Literature at UC Berkeley, and a member of the Humanities Research Institute Board of Governors.
