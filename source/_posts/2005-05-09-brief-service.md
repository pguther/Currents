The Student Volunteer Connection will be hosting the 4th Annual Service Recognition Ceremony at the Academic Resource Center on Thursday, May 26, from 4 to 6 p.m. The purpose of the event is to recognize students for their volunteer service in the community.

All students who are nominated or apply are invited to the ceremony and will be recognized. In additon, one student organization and one Greek organization will be honored for their exemplary community service involvement. Student award winners will receive cash prizes to donate to the nonprofit organization of their choice.

This year there's a new award for a faculty or staff member who inspires UCSC students by promoting community service and service learning through activism, mentorship, teaching, and/or community involvement.

[Nomination forms][1] are available online, and the submission deadline is May 19.
