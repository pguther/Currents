  Slawek Tulaczyk studies glaciers, glacial geology, geomorphology, and soil mechanics. He is especially interested in the feedback between climatic changes and the behavior of glaciers and ice sheets, as well as the influence of changes in glacial mass on the global sea level. Tulaczyk studies the sediments and landforms left behind by retreating glaciers as clues to glacial processes. He also collaborates with researchers involved in modeling the global climate. Tulaczyk earned a B.S. physical geography from the University of Wroclaw in Poland, an M.S. in geology from Northern Illinois University, and an M.S. in civil engineering and Ph.D. in geology from the California Institute of Technology. Before joining the UCSC faculty, he was an assistant professor of geology at the University of Kentucky.<br>
