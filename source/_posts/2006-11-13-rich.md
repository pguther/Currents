  Film scholar B. Ruby Rich of community studies published an article in the <i>Guardian</i> newspaper of London in September on the new film <i>Death of a President</i>.
</p>
<p>
  Rich also authored an article about Oliver Stone's new movie about the World Trade Center, <i>Out of the Rubble</i>, that made the cover of <i>Sight &amp; Sound</i>, the magazine of the British Film Institute.
</p>
<p>
  Finally, Rich was an invited participant at a September meeting at the Center for Social Media at American University in Washington, D.C. Funded by the Ford Foundation, the gathering marked the establishment of a working group on social documentary films.
