Film scholar B. Ruby Rich of community studies published an article in the _Guardian_ newspaper of London in September on the new film _Death of a President_.

Rich also authored an article about Oliver Stone's new movie about the World Trade Center, _Out of the Rubble_, that made the cover of _Sight & Sound_, the magazine of the British Film Institute.

Finally, Rich was an invited participant at a September meeting at the Center for Social Media at American University in Washington, D.C. Funded by the Ford Foundation, the gathering marked the establishment of a working group on social documentary films.
