<p>
  Art history professor Catherine Soussloff has been awarded a fellowship from the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute in Williamstown, Massachusetts. She will be using the institute's renowned collection of arts books and periodicals to complete her book-length study, "The Subject in Art," on the art historical representation in portraiture at the turn of the 19th-century. Soussloff will receive a stipend of $7,000, as well as travel and research expenses and housing during her two-month summer fellowship. Soussloff currently holds the Patricia and Rowland Rebele Chair in Art History. She is also the author of <i>The Absolute Artist</i> (University of Minnesota Press, 1997) and editor <i>of Jewish Identity in Modern Art History</i> (University of California Press, 1999) and "Interdisciplinarity in Art History" (forthcoming).

  <font color="#003399">Gay, Lesbian, Bi, Trans (GLBT) Resource Center</font>
</h4>The campus's Gay, Lesbian, Bi, Trans (GLBT) Resource Center has been awarded grants totaling nearly $19,000 to support Project STRANGE, the center's innovative outreach project serving gay and allied youth throughout Santa Cruz County.
<p>
  Last year, Project STRANGE, with critical startup money from the Community Foundation, organized more than 20 events, including dances, skating parties, film nights, conferences, and workshops in area high schools and on the UCSC campus. This year the Community Foundation is providing nearly $14,000 and the Colorado-based Gill Foundation has awarded $5,000 to support the ongoing work of the project.

  "STRANGE has flourished beyond our wildest dreams," said GLBT Resource Center director Deb Abbott, "and it is a shining example of how UCSC's commitment to undergraduate excellence increasingly includes providing students with opportunities for meaningful community involvement."
