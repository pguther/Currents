</h3>Harry Noller, Sinsheimer Professor of Molecular Biology and director of the Center for Molecular Biology of RNA, has been invited by the Netherlands Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology to be its guest "Speaker of the Year." Noller will travel to the Netherlands at the end of this month for a brief lecture tour, which will include visits to three universities in different parts of the country. He will also take part in informal discussions with researchers and graduate students. One of the aims of the program is to provide young people with an opportunity to meet with leading scientists in their field of interest. Noller will be the society's 23rd guest speaker, joining a list of internationally renowned scientists that includes James Watson, Paul Berg, Walter Gilbert, and Daniel Koshland.
