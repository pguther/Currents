Tickets are still available for the 24th summer season of [Shakespeare Santa Cruz][1] (SSC), running July 20 to August 28 at the UCSC Mainstage Theater and Festival Glen.

Featured in the June 13 issue of _Newsweek_ as one of five respected theater companies in the nation with promising seasons this summer, SSC will present another sterling combination of festive comedy, transformative drama, and wicked satire.

This year's plays include Shakespeare's quintessential comedy _Twelfth Night_ and poetic drama _The Winter's Tale_, plus W. S. Gilbert's brilliant satire _Engaged_. The fringe production is _The Antipodes_, written by Richard Brome in 1636.

_Twelfth Night_ contains some of Shakespeare's best-loved characters, including valiant Viola, lovesick Duke Orsino, Feste the wise fool, the priggish Malvolio, and Sir Toby Belch. It will be directed by P. J. Paparelli--artistic director at Perseverance Theatre in Juneau, Alaska, and former associate director of the Shakespeare Theatre in Washington D.C. Lauded by the _Washington Post_ as "one of the most exciting talents working in Washington today," Paparelli will be making his SSC directorial debut.

_The Winter's Tale_ includes some of Shakespeare's most beautiful imagery in a story involving a jealous king, a mistaken daughter, comic misadventure, loss, love, and reconciliation. Favorite SSC director Tim Ocel (_Taming of the Shrew, A Midsummer Night's Dream, Two Gentleman of Verona, As You Like It_) directs this production.

_Engaged_ by W. S. Gilbert features an extraordinary gallery of compelling characters caught between the competing attractions of sex and money in a hilarious satire of rampant British materialism and hypocrisy in the 1870s. It will be directed by SSC Artistic Director Paul Whitworth (_Princess and the Pea, Gretel & Hansel, Cinderella,_ and _Arms and the Man_).

This summer, for the first time, reserved seating is now available in the outdoor Festival Glen. Managing director Marcus Cato also noted other improvements SSC hopes to implement in the next few years--including the construction of a "sunshade" to make matinee performances in the glen more comfortable for the entire audience.

SSC also will offer a variety of extra events and activities to enhance audience appreciation of the 2005 season. These include a free lecture series at the Nickelodeon Theater beginning on July 15; free Saturday backstage tours beginning on August 6; and pre- and post-play discussions with the directors, designers, and actors.
