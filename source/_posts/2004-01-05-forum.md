The next Staff Advisory Board-sponsored forum to keep campus employees informed about the work of the Executive Budget Committee has been moved to Classroom Unit 2 on Wednesday, January 7. The time has also been changed; the forum will be from 12:30 p.m. to 1:30 p.m.

Workers' compensation is the topic of the forum, which was originally scheduled for BayTree Conference Room D.

On December 3, the UCSC team charged with streamlining campus purchasing operations presented its work to an overflow crowd of about 100 people. Sessions on November 5 and November 17 focused on campus efforts to streamline procedures in human resources and the time-and-attendance system.
