  Student research will take center stage March 4-5 at the annual Koret UC Leadership Excellence through Advanced Degrees (UC LEADS) Research and Leadership Symposium, hosted by UCSC.
</p>
<p>
  The event at UCSC's University Center draws undergraduates from the nine University of California campuses displaying research they have done in UC labs. UCSC faculty, graduate students, and postdoctoral scholars are encouraged to attend the poster sessions at the event and support undergraduates who have worked in their labs. The event also offers an opportunity to recruit top students to UCSC graduate programs.
</p>
<p>
  "This symposium provides these talented undergraduates an opportunity to engage in scientific discourse with members of the UCSC community, and also gives faculty a chance to interact with many potential applicants to UCSC Ph.D. programs," noted UCOP LEADS coordinator Sarah Dempsey.
</p>
<p>
  Scholars will share the results of their research through poster presentations, attend workshops and panels, listen to addresses, and interact with other members of the UC LEADS community.
