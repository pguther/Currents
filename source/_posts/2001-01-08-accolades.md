#### ![][1]**Sung-Mo Kang named ACM Fellow**

The Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) has honored Sung-Mo (Steve) Kang, the new dean of the Baskin School of Engineering, with selection as an ACM Fellow. Kang will be inducted as an ACM Fellow in an awards ceremony on March 11, 2001, at the ACM1 Conference in San Jose.   
  
The ACM Fellows program recognizes and honors outstanding ACM members for their achievements in computer science and information technology and for their significant contributions to the mission of the ACM.   
  
In naming Kang a fellow, the ACM cited his "outstanding contributions to computer-aided design for performance and reliability of CMOS VLSI and optoelectronic circuits and systems for high performance computing and communications."  
  
Kang's research interests include computer chip design (specifically, methods of very large-scale integration, or VLSI) and optimization of chip design for performance, reliability, and manufacturability; modeling and simulation of semiconductor devices and circuits; high-speed optoelectronic circuits; and fully optical network systems.   
  
Kang is also a fellow of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) and of the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). He is a foreign member of the National Academy of Engineering of Korea and the recipient of numerous national and international awards and honors.  
  
Founded in 1947, the ACM is the world's first educational and scientific computing society. The ACM Fellows serve as distinguished colleagues to whom the ACM and its members look for guidance and leadership as the world of information technology evolves.
