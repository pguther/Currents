America's shifting demographics will have a profound impact on philanthropy, according to Judith Nichols, a fundraising practitioner and researcher who will lead a series of workshops on "[Building the Individual Donor Base for UC Santa Cruz][1]" on January 13.

The sessions, sponsored by University Relations and open to all faculty and staff, will be held at the University Center.   

"It takes about 15 years for our perceptions to catch up with reality," says Nichols, "Americans are just beginning to understand that the majority of us are living well into our 80s and 90s, rather than the 'three score and 10' we were told we would need to plan for."  

Nichols specializes in helping organizations understand how changing populations, generational differences, and other demographic factors, especially those affecting the "baby boom" generation, influence charitable giving. She offers practical solutions for responding to emerging opportunities and working with donors in the new fundraising paradigm.   

"Building the individual donor base for UC Santa Cruz" is expected to be of particular relevance to faculty and department chairs interested in learning the latest trends in fundraising and working in partnership with University Relations.

To assist in event planning, attendees are asked to RSVP via [e-mail][2] or by calling (831) 459-2501.
