### **Slug back home after trip on 'Enterprise'**

A local banana slug is back in the woods of Santa Cruz following a brush with fame aboard the television show "Enterprise" on UPN.  
  
The critter had a prominent role in the Wednesday, October 3, episode in which the crew was starting to explore outer space. The only life the crew found was an alien slug (superbly acted by our local banana slug). The crew's linguist, logically enough, spoke to the pet alien, bringing it close to her face before releasing it.  
  
By coincidence, the show's producer, Brannon Braga, studied film and video at UCSC. Braga said a special banana slug handler was hired for the show (perhaps to fend off the paparazzi?)  
  
No word on whether the slug was "discovered" at the Porter College coffee house, The Hungry Slug, or whether more acting jobs are in the offing. Don't call us...

### Documentary film 'The Witness' explores human-animal relationship

The campus community and the public are invited to a screening of the award-winning documentary film [_The Witness_][3] on Saturday, October 27, at 7:30 p.m. in Classroom Unit 2. _The Witness_ tells the story of Eddie Lama, a construction contractor from a tough Brooklyn neighborhood who grew up in a family that had an aversion to animals. With humor and sincerity, Eddie describes his step-by-step journey to compassion, from the unexpected love of a kitten who opened his heart, to the shocking undercover video footage that motivated him to invent a wholly new method of awakening the public to the injustice of animal exploitation. A discussion with the director, producer, and star of the film will follow. The event is sponsored by OPERS and the Center for Animal Protection and Education (CAPE). Tickets are $3/students, $5/general. For more information, call (831) 459-2806.
