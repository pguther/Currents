The Northern California chapter of the Achievement Rewards for College Scientists (ARCS) Foundation has provided $70,000 in scholarships this year for nine outstanding graduate students at UCSC.

The ARCS Foundation is a national organization that provides scholarships and fellowships for the country's most promising science, medical, and engineering students. The foundation is the most generous provider of annual student awards to the UCSC campus.  
  
UCSC's 2001 ARCS scholars represent the Science Communication Program and the Departments of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Computer Science, Earth Sciences, Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, and Ocean Sciences.   
  
Five UCSC graduate students received $10,000 ARCS scholarships: Jennifer Brown (ecology and evolutionary biology); Philip Choi (astronomy and astrophysics); Heather DeShon (Earth sciences); Terrence Furey (computer science); and Michael Wara (ocean sciences).  
  
Four graduate students in the Science Communication Program each received a $5,000 ARCS scholarship: Linley Hall, Kendall Powell, Desiree Scorcia, and Cameron Walker.   
  
The 2001 ARCS scholars will be honored at the foundation's annual luncheon on February 19 at the Westin St. Francis Hotel in San Francisco.
