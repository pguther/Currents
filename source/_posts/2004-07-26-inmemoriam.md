In Memoriam

Jeanne Gray

Jeanne Gray, former director of student business services at UCSC,   
died July 25 after a steady decline in her health due to complications  
from diabetes.  

Gray came to UCSC from Atlanta in 1987, where she had been manager of student loans and collections for Emory University. She retired in 1998 and moved to Arkansas. Gray was highly respected and liked by her staff and coworkers, who recall that her Southern charm helped her win over more than one difficult challenge.  

Her passion away from work was the Literacy Program, and she spent many hours reading to children and encouraging them to become avid readers.  

A memorial service is scheduled for noon, August 7, in The First Presbyterian Church, 204 N. 4th Street, Ozark, Arkansas 72949. Contributions may be made to the American Diabetes Association, P.O. Box 1131, Fairfax, VA 22038-113. Checks should be made payable to: American Diabetes Association.
