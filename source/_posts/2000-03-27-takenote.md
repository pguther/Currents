#### UCSC ranked 11th in Peace Corps volunteers this year

The [Peace Corps' annual list][1] of colleges and universities with the largest number of volunteers serving overseas puts UCSC in the number 11 spot along with UC Davis. Last year UCSC was 22nd in the rankings. UCSC has 60 volunteers serving this year. The only other UC campus with more graduates in the Peace Corps is UC Berkeley, with 71 volunteers.

The Peace Corps will be recruiting 400 more volunteers this year, with plans to expand the program to 10,000 volunteers over the next few years. If you would like to find out more about opportunities in the Peace Corps, plan to attend one of two informational meetings in April. The first will be held on Wednesday, April 5, from 7 to 8:30 p.m. at Louden Nelson Community Center in downtown Santa Cruz, and the second on Thursday, April 6, from 1 to 2 p.m. at Oakes College, Guzman Lounge.

#### Help get the word out about the Census in Beach Flats

On Sunday, April 2, the Beach Flats Community Center and La Familia Center will be holding an event at the Beach Flats Park with food, music, and information about the Census. The Census is a very important opportunity to be counted for funding of community programs. Due to fear of incarceration or deportation many undocumented individuals do not fill out their Census forms. Others do not fill out the form because they simply cannot understand what it says. Volunteers are needed from 1 to 6 p.m. to help serve food, collect Census forms, and for set up and clean up at the event. Spanish speakers would be useful but are not a must. For more information, contact Carmen Rojas at crojas3892@hotmail.com.

UCSC alumnus Jeffrey Mount, professor of geology and director of the Center for Integrated Watershed Science and Management at UC Davis and author of _California Rivers and Streams: The Conflict Between Fluvial Processes and Land Use,_ will give an overview of the physical and biological processes that shape California's rivers and watersheds, and he will discuss the highly contentious issue of flood management versus river restoration. A reception will follow the event. For more information, contact Jim Zachos at jzachos@earthsci.ucsc.edu.
