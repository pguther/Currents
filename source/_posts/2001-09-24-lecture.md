The public is invited to attend a free lecture by renowned University of Chicago anthropologist Marshall Sahlins, who will discuss "Culture and Agency in History" at the University of California, Santa Cruz, on September 24 at 7 p.m. The event will take place in Oakes 105.

Sahlins is the Charles F. Grey Distinguished Service Professor of Anthropology Emeritus at the University of Chicago. He is the author of many books, including _Stone Age Economics_, _Culture and Practical Reason_, _Islands of History_, _Uses and Abuses of Biology_, _How "Natives" Think: About Captain Cook For Example_, and, most recently, _Culture in Practice: Selected Essays_.  
  
Sahlins has been described by Claude Levi-Strauss as "one of the most profound and original anthropologists of our time." His work has been heralded as a bridge linking American and European intellectual traditions, and he has been praised for his multidisciplinary and integrative approach.  
  
Sahlins's current focus is on the intersection of culture and history, especially as they play out in early-modern Pacific societies. He has written about Hawaiian history, war and cannibalism in 19-century Fiji, and many other topics.   
  
The talk is being cosponsored by the UCSC Division of Social Sciences, the Departments of Anthropology and Philosophy, the Institute for Humanities Research, the Center for Justice, Tolerance, and Community, the Center for Cultural Studies, and the Center for Global, International, and Regional Studies.
