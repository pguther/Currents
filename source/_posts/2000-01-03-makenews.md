Psychology's **Craig Haney** has fielded media calls recently about prison-related issues from the _Cleveland Plain Dealer,_ the _Riverfront Times_ in St. Louis, and CNN-Time, which is preparing a story on the backgrounds of people on death row.

A visit to Santa Cruz by the internationally acclaimed band Mariachi Los Camperos de Nati Cano was covered by local and national media. CBS sent a camera crew to shoot a segment for _CBS This Morning._ **Martin Wollesen,** director of UCSC's Arts & Lectures (which presented the show), was interviewed for news stories on Fox TV-Channel 35 and for a cover story in the _Santa Cruz County Sentinel's _entertainment magazine_._ **Roberto Garcia** of EAOP was also interviewed about the concert by KSMS TV-Channel 67.

**Joseph Bunnett**, professor emeritus of chemistry, wrote an editorial in the _Santa Cruz County Sentinel_ about the Narrative Evaluation System, putting the current controversy into a historical perspective. Graduate Student Association chair **Kami Chisholm** also wrote an op-ed on narratives, which appeared with the Bunnett piece in the _Sentinel._

"Over the Wall" a dance concert staged by choreographer **Mel Wong** earned the cover of the _Good Times_ when it opened in December. The lengthy story (titled "He Did it His Way") focused not only on this performance by the Mel Wong Dance Company but on Wong's long and fertile career.
