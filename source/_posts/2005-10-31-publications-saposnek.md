Psychology lecturer Donald T. Saposnek guest edited and contributed to a special issue of _Family Court Review._ The issue, published in October, focuses on [Special Needs Children in the Family Court][1].

Special needs children include those with acute, life-threatening medical conditions, chronic developmental disorders, and psychological and behavioral syndromes. Saposnek proposed the issue after noticing a growing number of custody disputes involving special needs children. Other authors include family court judges, forensic psychologists, and family law attorneys.
