  Psychology lecturer Donald T. Saposnek guest edited and contributed to a special issue of <i>Family Court Review.</i> The issue, published in October, focuses on <a href="http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/toc/fcre/43/4">Special Needs Children in the Family Court</a>.
</p>
<p>
  Special needs children include those with acute, life-threatening medical conditions, chronic developmental disorders, and psychological and behavioral syndromes. Saposnek proposed the issue after noticing a growing number of custody disputes involving special needs children. Other authors include family court judges, forensic psychologists, and family law attorneys.
