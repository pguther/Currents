In a ceremony that cast aside pomp and circumstance in favor of multiculturalism, Denice D. Denton was formally invested as the ninth chancellor of UC Santa Cruz on Friday, capping a two-day symposium on excellence and diversity.

"UC Santa Cruz does things differently but for a purpose," said Denton, whose choice of a nontraditional inauguration was in keeping with the campus's reputation for innovation.

As he prepared to present Denton with the Chancellor's Medal, UC President Robert Dynes acknowledged the milestone--and the campus's recent change of status within the UC system.

"On Labor Day this year, Santa Cruz ended its 40-year stint as the young kid on the block," said Dynes. The campus, with its unsurpassed physical beauty, highly regarded programs, and commitment to public service, "exemplifies why the UC system is the premier university system in the world," he added.

Describing Denton as forthright, honest, direct, and a "trailblazer in pursuit of equity and multiculturalism," Dynes said she has the "capability to raise this campus to the next level. It will be my pleasure to watch her, help her, advise her, and cheer."

Denton received a standing ovation from the near-capacity crowd in the Music Center Recital Hall as she took the podium. Sprinkling her remarks with Japanese, Arabic, Spanish, and Swahili, Denton pledged her commitment to the campus and hailed UCSC's leadership in interdisciplinary research. She praised her predecessors, as well as the students, staff, faculty, and administrators "on whose achievements we build."

Denton challenged the campus to "lead at the edge" and outlined six priorities that will guide decisions and the distribution of resources.
