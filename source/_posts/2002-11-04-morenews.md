Bolivia Bound: An evening of slides and stories with guide and adventure traveler Randy Pomeroy Nov. 5

Bolivia is known as the 'Tibet of South America.' It is a landlocked country in the middle of South America with unimaginable diversity. From the Amazon Basin to the tops of 20,000 foot snow capped peaks, from lowland jungle Indians to high altitude lama herders, from the Inca trails to the birthplace of the sun on Lake Titicaca this country has something for everyone.  

Randy Pomeroy (Porter '01) will show his slides of Bolivia on Tuesday, November 5, at 7 p.m. in Classroom Unit 1. The pictures were taken during an expedition he led for a college group from England in July.   

Pomeroy has more than 15 years experience working with Outward Bound, Top Guides, Pro Action Associates, Catalyst Consulting, and UCSC Recreation and Wilderness Orientation, and he has his own adventure education company, University of Earth.

Tickets for the slide show are $2/students, $4/general, available at the door. The show is a benefit for the UCSC Recreation Scholarship Program. For more information, call the UCSC Recreation Department at (831) 459-2806.

University of California named lead plaintiff in Dynegy Securities Suit  

The United States District Court Monday (Oct. 28) named the University of California as lead plaintiff in the Dynegy securities fraud class action lawsuit. Judge Sim Lake of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas in Houston based his 27-page ruling on a combination of factors, including the amount of losses that UC sustained as a result of its Dynegy investments, the characterization of its claims as "typical" of those of other class members, and its ability to litigate the case on behalf of the shareholders.  

The University of California's Dynegy losses totaled $112.4 million, based on 4.16 million shares purchased between Nov. 1, 2000, and May 7, 2002\. The current value of UC's diversified portfolio, which includes both pension and endowment funds, stands at approximately $51 billion. [Full text of press release][5]
