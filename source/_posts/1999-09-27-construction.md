  The following is an update on some of the major construction projects planned for the campus during the current academic year. The listing includes some of the expected impacts the projects may have on members of the campus community.<b><br>
  <br>
  Bay Tree Bookstore expansion and Graduate Commons:<br></b>Work will continue on exterior and interior walls, and mechanical, electrical, and plumbing systems will be installed for the 6,600-square-foot commons and 30,000-square-foot bookstore. The commons will offer office and recreational space for graduate students and space that will be occupied by the Whole Earth Restaurant. The new Bay Tree Bookstore building will feature an expanded selection of books, supplies, and services, and its third floor will feature office space for an expansion of Student Services, four conference rooms, and two outdoor decks. A pedestrian plaza is also planned. The projects, totaling $13.5 million, are expected to be completed during spring 2000. Hagar Drive, near the project, will remain one way, northbound, throughout construction. There will be occasional traffic delays due to construction vehicles. Construction noise in immediate area (Whole Earth Restaurant and Bookstore) will be experienced.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Interdisciplinary Sciences Building:<br></b>Construction is expected to start late this fall on the new Interdisciplinary Sciences Building, which will be built as an addition to the eastern end of Natural Sciences 2. The building will provide 34,137 assignable square feet of teaching, laboratory, research, office, and support space for the Environmental Studies, Astronomy, and Physics Departments. Construction on the $16.5 million project is expected to be completed by winter 2001. There will be traffic delays on the service road to the Science Library, Earth and Marine Sciences, and Natural Sciences 2. Pedestrian paths will be rerouted along the construction site. Temporary parking impacts will be experienced.<br>
  <br>
  <b>OPERS Fitness Center:<br></b>Interior finishing work, landscaping, and road resurfacing continues for the new 10,600-square-foot weight-training and fitness center for the Office of Physical Education, Recreation, and Sports. Construction on the $4 million facility is expected to be completed and exercise equipment installed in late fall.<br>
  <br>
  <b>College Nine Apartments:<br></b>Construction is continuing on the College Nine Apartments, located north of the existing Colleges Nine and Ten academic buildings. The $20.76 million project will provide housing for 280 undergraduate students. Traffic delays at access road to Social Sciences 1 and 2 due to construction deliveries. Construction-related noise expected.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Core West Parking Structure:<br></b>Preliminary site work has been done. Bids were received August 24, and completion of construction is scheduled for October 2000. Short-term construction impacts include loss of 66 parking spaces in Lot #112 and up to 16 parking spaces in Lot #113 that will be used for construction staging. Temporary noise impacts during construction could be experienced at nearby science buildings (Natural Sciences 2, Baskin Engineering, and Sinsheimer Labs) and at the Graduate Student Apartments. Noise mitigation measures such as restricted hours of operation will be required to minimize noise impacts. Some pedestrian circulation could be subject to temporary adjustments to accommodate construction. Project includes improved and/or new pedestrian, bicycle, and transit facilities.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Center for Ocean Health:<br></b>Construction of the site work portion of this Long Marine Laboratory project is expected to start this fall. The building will consist of office and laboratory space for the Institute of Marine Sciences and other campus units involved in marine research. The project is partially funded by a gift from the Packard Foundation. Several of the existing modular office units will be removed to make way for the construction. Construction traffic should be expected in the vicinity of the existing facilities and the Long Marine Lab access road.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Long Marine Lab infrastructure improvements:<br></b>A project to extend sewer and natural gas underground piping to the Long Marine Lab is expected to begin in the fall and be completed by approximately January 2000. Traffic delays will occur along the length of the access road to the Long Marine Lab as work progresses. The road will remain open to traffic throughout construction.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Improvements to Arts Facilities:<br></b>Construction completed.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Seymour Marine Discovery Center:<br></b>Construction completed.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Road resurfacing and repair projects:<br></b>Physical Plant will construct retaining walls and repair and resurface several campus roads this fall. These include McLaughlin Drive, from the bridge east of Science Hill to Heller Drive; Steinhart Way, from the McLaughlin intersection to the bookstore parking lot; and Heller Drive, from the College Eight entrance to near the McLaughlin Drive intersection. The work is scheduled to begin September 27 and end November 19. During the road repair projects there will be one-way traffic at the various work locations on Heller, Steinhart, and McLaughlin. There will be flagperson traffic control at these locations and delays up to 3 minutes should be expected to allow traffic to pass from the opposite direction.<br>
  <br>
  <b>Roof-repair projects, renovations:<br></b>Physical Plant plans roof work for Hahn Student Services (8/19/99-10/18/99), the Communications Building (9/27/99-10/19/99), the Central Garage (9/30/99-11/14/99), and the East Field House dance studio and activity building (10/4/99-12/4/99). In addition, crews will renovate restrooms in the Crown College academic building and replace windows in Porter College Building D.
