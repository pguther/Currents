The New Year means new specials and merchandise at the [University Center][1].

January 14 is "Bring a Friend Day" at the UCenter from 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. Diners bringing someone new to the center will receive half off the price of the less-expensive meal. (The hours for this promotion were listed incorrectly in the January printed _Currents_.)

The University Center is now also selling UCenter logo coffee cups and aprons. Those returning with their logo coffee cups will be able to get a cup of coffee for only $1.

For more information on the [University Center][1], call (831) 459-4321 or check online.
