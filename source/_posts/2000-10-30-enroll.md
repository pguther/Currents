Enrollment at UCSC has exceeded 12,000 students for the first time, according to the "third-week" totals for the fall 2000 quarter, released earlier this month by UCSC's Office of Planning and Budget.  
  
While fall enrollment totals 12,124, the three-quarter average for the 2000-01 academic year is projected to be 11,785. Enrollment becomes official each quarter after the third week of classes.  
  
Of the 12,124 total this quarter, 11,047 are undergraduates; 1,077, graduate students.
