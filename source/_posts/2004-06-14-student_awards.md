Students were recognized for a range of accomplishments at the Student Achievement Week Awards Ceremony June 4 at the Colleges Nine and Ten Multipurpose Room.

Acting Chancellor Martin M. Chemers welcomed the gathering, and Lynda Goff, vice provost and dean of undergraduate education, served as emcee. Tenai Eguen and Million Negassi were the event's student speakers.

Among the awards were the:  

**Steck Award:** Loren Steck presented Max Krochmal with the Steck Award, honoring the finest senior thesis completed during the academic year. Krochmal's project was "Sculpting Transnational Unionism: Building a Democratic Labor Movement in Ecuador's Banana Fields." The Steck Award winner is chosen from the Chancellor's Award candidates. Steck Committee members are Mary Doyle, David Graves, John Martin, Gary Novack, and Loren Steck.

**Goldwater Scholarship:** Tracey Kwong received the Barry M. Goldwater Scholarship. The Barry M. Goldwater Scholarship & Excellence in Education Program was established by Congress in 1986. Its purpose is to provide a continuing source of qualified scientists, mathematicians, and engineers by awarding scholarships to college students who intend to pursue careers in those fields.

**Srauss Scholarship:** The winner of the Donald A. Strauss Scholarship was Timothy Galarneau. The Strauss Foundation awards scholarships to students from selected four-year California colleges and universities who have demonstrated an interest in public service, have outstanding leadership potential, and are in the upper one-third of their class.

**Thimann Scholarship:** Receiving the Kenneth and Ann Thimann Scholarship was Thea Wilson. The Kenneth and Ann Thimann Scholarship is awarded to a graduating UCSC senior who has been accepted to graduate school and shows the most promise as a future scientist in biology, chemistry, Earth sciences, or physics.
