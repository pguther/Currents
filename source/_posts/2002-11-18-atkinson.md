Richard C. Atkinson has announced that he will resign as the president of the University of California, effective October 1, 2003.   

Atkinson, 73, took office October 1, 1995, and will have served for eight years when he steps down. He is the 17th president of the University of California system.

"That is a lengthy period of time for positions of this kind," Atkinson told the Board of Regents at a meeting in San Francisco. "These have been extremely rewarding years -- challenging, stimulating, and deeply interesting years. But the time has come to bring them to a close, and to allow the University to move forward under new leadership. It also is time, I might add, for my grandchildren to see more of their grandfather."

In a [message][1] to the campus community, Chancellor Greenwood shares the news; information is also available on a [web page][2] posted by UC's Office of the President.
