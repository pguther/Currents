The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) has conferred the honor of IEEE Fellow on Bin Yu, a senior research scientist at the University Affiliated Research Center (UARC), a partnership of UCSC and NASA Ames Research Center located at the NASA Research Park in Mountain View.

Yu conducts research in the nanotechnology research and development group at NASA Ames. Nanotechnology is one of several core areas in which UCSC is managing research projects for NASA through the UARC partnership.

The IEEE Board of Directors recognized Yu "for contributions to scaling of silicon common metal oxide semiconductor transistors." This is a forefront technology for incorporation of nanoscale features in advanced semiconductors.
