The University Events Office has redesigned UCSC's Campus Calendar on the Web. In addition to a cleaner look and simpler interface, the [redesigned calendar][1] boasts new features to help sponsors of meetings, performances, lectures, and other campus functions plan and carry out their events, said Karen Hilker of University Events. With the new calendar:

* Event sponsors and others can enter information about their events directly onto the Web calendar;
* Listings can be updated or corrected by sponsors at any time;
* Sponsors can indicate whether they want additional publicity from the listing, such as an on- or off-campus print calendar entry;
* Users can list events for planning purposes only and indicate that the event shouldn't be searchable on the Web calendar;
* Users can retrieve information via improved "search" and "help" functions.

The benefits of placing a listing in the new calendar are threefold, said Hilker.   
  
First, the listing can help generate publicity for the event through the Web, on-campus publications, or outside media. Second, the calendar can help event planners across campus coordinate their events. Finally, the listings give University Events a "heads up" about the event so the office can provide assistance when needed.  
  
"We'll contact people if there are issues we can help them with, such as signage for the event, parking, or increased shuttle services," said Hilker.  
  
Event sponsors are encouraged to list information about their event as soon as possible, even if the information is incomplete, Hilker added.   
  
University Events uses the calendar information to generate several publicity opportunities, Hilker said. Event information may be included in calendar listings for _Currents,_ _The Good Times,_ KZSC, or the campus cable channel, or it can be printed on a weekly flyer that is distributed campuswide. Event sponsors may also request that their event not be publicized at all.   
  
To enter information onto the Web calendar, event sponsors must obtain a password from the University Events Office. For more information, call (831) 459-5390 or send e-mail to [calendar@cats.ucsc.edu][2].
