At its winter-quarter meeting on Wednesday, February 23, the Academic Senate will be asked to consider legislation that would bring UC's conventional grading system to UCSC.

The meeting begins at 3 p.m. in Classroom Unit 2. The Senate's Committee on Educational Policy (CEP), which is proposing the legislation, wants to separate the issues of grades and UCSC's Narrative Evaluation System."This resolution is silent on the matter of narrative evaluations. The CEP believes that it would be most prudent to separate the two issues, so that the complex matter of narrative evaluations can be subsequently debated, as an entirely independent matter."

The CEP recommends that "no more than 25 percent of the UCSC course work applied toward graduation credit may be taken on a Pass/No Pass basis." This is equivalent to or stricter than all other UC campuses. The proposal introduces pluses and minuses for grades A, B, and C.
