<p>
  UCSC's Division of the Humanities will introduce a brand-new program at this year's Banana Slug Spring Fair.
</p>
<p>
  Titled "Classes without Quizzes," it's a series of lively one-hour lectures from 11 of the university's most distinguished humanities faculty.
</p>
<p>
  Encompassing a wide range of topics--from the history of feminism to why languages are dying at a rate never before seen in human history--the classes are intended to help alums reconnect with university life.
</p>
<p>
  "It's a great way for alumni to become re-engaged with what should be their most important link to the university--its intellectual life," explained interim humanities dean Gary Lease. "We hope to attract non-humanities grads to the lectures, too, because the topics--from philosophy chair Paul Roth on the ethics of U.S. cancer policy to professor of history Alice Yang Murray on the reliability of WW II oral histories--have broad appeal to our well-read, thoughtful alumni."
</p>
<p>
  Other lecture topics will include "How Did Dickens Write His Novels and Why Are They So Long?" by Dickens Project director John Jordan; "Classical Myth in American Popular Culture" with chair and professor of literature Mary-Kay Gamel; "Rethinking Anti-Semitism: The Holocaust and the Contemporary World" with history professor Peter Kenez; and "Writerama" with senior writing lecturer Donald Rothman, cofounder of the Central California Writing Project and recipient of the 2005-06 Distinguished Teaching Award from the UCSC Alumni Association.
</p>
<p>
  Interim Dean Lease, an internationally recognized expert on the history of religion, will present a class titled "Will the Real Jesus Please Stand Up?" Lease noted that faculty response to the new program has been overwhelmingly enthusiastic.<br>
  <br>
  "The most difficult task we had was in choosing a handful of representative lectures to cover the whole of the humanities," Lease noted. "We just didn't have enough classrooms or staff to offer more sessions."
</p>
<p>
  "Classes Without Quizzes" will be held on Saturday, April 22, in the Social Sciences 2 Building. The first session will begin at 2:30 p.m. and the second session at 3:30 p.m. All classes are free and open to the public.
</p>
