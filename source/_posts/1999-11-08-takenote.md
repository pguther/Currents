  <font color="#003399">Diversity Dialogue Groups forming</font>
</h4>
<p>
  <font color="#000000">Ten staff members have just finished the initial Diversity Dialogue Group Leader Training and are now looking to recruit staff to join their groups. Each group consists of five to seven members who make a commitment to meet four hours each month for one year. At these meetings, participants learn from one another through open, frank discussion about assumptions, stereotypes, and individual perceptions of difference. The program requires that supervisors release their employees two hours each month to attend group meetings and that employees volunteer two hours of their own time. Groups will be forming by mid-November. For more information or to join a group, contact Terilynn Pennisi-Miller at (831) 459-3252 or terilynn@cats.ucsc.edu.</font>

  <font color="#003399">Meningitis vaccine</font>
</h4>
<p>
  Over the past decade there has been a rising incidence of outbreaks of meningitis reported on college campuses. This has prompted the American College Health Association (ACHA) to recommend that college students "consider vaccination to reduce their risk for potentially fatal meningococcal disease." There is a vaccine available against meningococcal disease that is 85 percent effective against many, but not all, of the subgroups of meningococcal bacteria. The Student Health Service is following the ACHA recommendation of making vaccination and information available to students. Students can make an appointment for vaccination by calling (831) 459-2500. Immunization costs $65, plus the injection fee. Most health insurance, including the campus undergraduate and graduate plans, does not cover the cost of this preventive measure, but charges can be billed to the student's university account. For more information on meningococcal disease, go to the <a href="http://www.acha.org/special-prj/men.htm">American College Health Association Web site.</a>

  <font color="#003399">Nominations for Regents' Professors and Lecturers sought</font>
</h4>
<p>
  The Committee on Regents' Professors and Lecturers is soliciting nominations for the 2000-01 academic year. The program was established to bring distinguished men and women from nonacademic careers to the university. The program has limited funding for stipends and travel only. Sponsoring units should be prepared to cover other expenses such as housing, transportation, etc., during the individual's visit to campus. Regents' Lecturer appointments may be for two weeks or more, but less than a full quarter; Regents' Professors may serve for a quarter and the individual may be assigned a course to teach. Full information on the program is in the <a href="http://www.ucop.edu/acadadv/acadpers/apm/s2-290.html">Academic Personnel Manual.</a> Nominations should originate from academic units rather than individuals and should provide detailed information on how the nominee would be utilized. The deadline for submission of nominations to the committee is November 30. Requests for additional information should be directed to Linda Mueller, Academic Human Resources, at (831) 459-4689, or mule@cats.<font color="#000000">ucsc.edu.</font>
