The winter campus closure begins Friday, December 24, and continues through Sunday, January 2. In all, the campus will be closed for ten days; four days are scheduled holidays (December 24, 27, 30, and 31), four days are weekend days, and the remaining two days (December 28, 29) are designated workdays. To cover the two designated workdays, full-time staff employees will be required to use 16 hours of vacation, compensatory time off, or leave without pay. Employees without sufficient accumulated vacation will be allowed to use up to two days of vacation leave prior to actual accrual.

New employees who are normally required to wait six months before using accrued vacation will be allowed to use their vacation even if the required waiting period has not been completed.

Part-time employees who are eligible for vacation may borrow vacation hours on a prorated basis in accordance with their percentage of appointment.

Employees scheduled to work on December 28 and 29 will be compensated at their regular rate of pay.  
  
Due to the diverse responsibilities of academic appointees and the flexibility in performing their obligations, it is anticipated that some academic appointees will continue working during the campus closure.

Fiscal-year (11-month) appointees will be expected to use vacation for this period, if the closure precludes their working.
