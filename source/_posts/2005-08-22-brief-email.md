Campus email users receiving an unusual number of "bounceback" messages may be inadvertently using out-of-date addresses.

Campus email addresses that include _ADM, zzyx,_ and _natsci_ have been phased out, and e-mail to those addresses no longer reach their intended recipients.

While many users have simply dropped the extra letters from their email addresses, others have selected completely different e-mail addresses during the changeover (i.e., _user@zzyx.ucsc.edu_ could have been changed to _samz@ucsc.edu_.

Please check online by using the Faculty / Staff directory at <http://www.ucsc.edu/about/find_people.asp> to find the most current campus e-mail addresses.
