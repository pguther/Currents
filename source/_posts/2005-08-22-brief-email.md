<p>
  Campus email users receiving an unusual number of "bounceback" messages may be inadvertently using out-of-date addresses.
</p>
<p>
  Campus email addresses that include <i>ADM, zzyx,</i> and <i>natsci</i> have been phased out, and e-mail to those addresses no longer reach their intended recipients.
</p>
<p>
  While many users have simply dropped the extra letters from their email addresses, others have selected completely different e-mail addresses during the changeover (i.e., <i>user@zzyx.ucsc.edu</i> could have been changed to <i>samz@ucsc.edu</i>.
</p>
<p>
  Please check online by using the Faculty / Staff directory at <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/about/find_people.asp">http://www.ucsc.edu/about/find_people.asp</a> to find the most current campus e-mail addresses.
