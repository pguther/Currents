#### Public hearing on the Supplemental EIR for Colleges Nine and Ten Residence Halls and Dining Hall November 8

A Draft Supplemental Environmental Impact Report (SEIR) has been prepared for the Colleges Nine and Ten Residence Halls and Dining Hall project. A Public Hearing will be held on November 8 between 6 and 8 p.m. at the Barn Theater. At this meeting, campus planners will provide a description of the project and its environmental effects, and members of the public will be invited to give oral comments on the Draft SEIR for the project. Call Christine Aldecoa at (831) 459-4407 for additional information or to request accommodations for persons with disabilities.

The proposed project is the construction of six residence halls (approximately 124,200 assignable square feet) and a dining hall (approximately 31,500 asf) on the Colleges Nine and Ten site north of McLaughlin Drive in the central UCSC campus. The residence halls would provide bed spaces for approximately 807 students. The dining hall building would house dining hall facilities for the residence halls and also a University Center, with a lounge, dining hall, kitchen, and conference rooms.

#### Fran Crane Day in Santa Cruz

November 5, 1999, has been proclaimed "Fran Crane Day" in the city of Santa Cruz by Mayor Katherine Beiers in honor of long-time staff member Fran Crane, a nationally recognized long-distance motorcycle rider, who died September 12 following a motorcylce accident.

#### Diversity Dialogue Groups forming

Ten staff members have just finished the initial Diversity Dialogue Group Leader Training and are now looking to recruit staff to join their groups. Each group consists of five to seven members who make a commitment to meet four hours each month for one year. At these meetings, participants learn from one another through open, frank discussion about assumptions, stereotypes, and individual perceptions of difference. The program requires that supervisors release their employees two hours each month to attend group meetings and that employees volunteer two hours of their own time. Groups will be forming by mid-November. For more information or to join a group, contact Terilynn Pennisi-Miller at (831) 459-3252 or terilynn@cats.ucsc.edu.

#### Meningitis vaccine

Over the past decade there has been a rising incidence of outbreaks of meningitis reported on college campuses. This has prompted the American College Health Association (ACHA) to recommend that college students "consider vaccination to reduce their risk for potentially fatal meningococcal disease" There is a vaccine available against meningococcal disease that is 85 percent effective against many, but not all, of the subgroups of meningococcal bacteria. The Student Health Service is following the ACHA recommendation of making vaccination and information available to students. Students can make an appointment for vaccination by calling (831) 459-2500. Immunization costs $65, plus the injection fee. Most health insurance, including the campus undergraduate and graduate plans, does not cover the cost of this preventive measure, but charges can be billed to the student's university account. For more information on meningococcal disease, go to the [American College Health Association Web site.][1]

#### **Donations sought for annual Women at Work Retreat Craft Fair**

The Annual Women at Work Retreat Craft Fair will be held this year on December 1 and 2. Fair organizers are calling on all artists and craftspersons to donate to this wonderful event, which supports the Women at Work Retreat scholarship fund. Jewelry, woodwork, ceramics, photos, clothing, candles, pictures, soaps, cards, holiday ornaments, and decorations have been donated in the past. All items should be turned in by November 29. To donate crafts or for more information, contact Connie Croker at (831) 459-2713.

#### Nominations for Regents' Professors and Lecturers sought

The Committee on Regents' Professors and Lecturers is soliciting nominations for the 2000-01 academic year. The program was established to bring distinguished men and women from nonacademic careers to the university. The program has limited funding for stipends and travel only. Sponsoring units should be prepared to cover other expenses such as housing, transportation, etc., during the individual's visit to campus. Regents' Lecturer appointments may be for two weeks or more, but less than a full quarter; Regents' Professors may serve for a quarter and the individual may be assigned a course to teach. Full information on the program is in the [Academic Personnel Manual.][2] Nominations should originate from academic units rather than individuals and should provide detailed information on how the nominee would be utilized. The deadline for submission of nominations to the committee is November 30. Requests for additional information should be directed to Linda Mueller, Academic Human Resources, at (831) 459-4689, or mule@cats.ucsc.edu.

#### **Get help planning your conference or meeting**

These services range from scheduling meeting rooms, to maintaining a database of participants, to managing the event's budget. For more information, call (831) 459-4429 or go to the [Conference and Summer Housing Office Web site][3].

#### **Community service survey**
