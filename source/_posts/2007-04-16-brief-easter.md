  UCSC Dining Services staff members and their families were treated to an egg hunt and barbecue on Easter Sunday, courtesy of the <a href="http://people.ucsc.edu/%7Eeolvera/lbsa">Latino Business Student Association</a> at Oakes College.
</p>
<p>
  "We wanted to say thank you for feeding us," said organization co-president Ezequiel Olvera. Formed in 2004, the Latino organization emphasizes professionalism, community involvement, academic excellence, and social interaction.
</p>
<p>
  "The party was an opportunity for us to get to know the children and the workers," said Olvera, who estimated that about 50 staff members and their children took part.
</p>
<p>
  It was the second year for the celebration, one that Ezekiel predicts will become a tradition at UCSC. "This is going to be a thing that will go on as long as the University is here."
