UCSC Dining Services staff members and their families were treated to an egg hunt and barbecue on Easter Sunday, courtesy of the [Latino Business Student Association][1] at Oakes College.

"We wanted to say thank you for feeding us," said organization co-president Ezequiel Olvera. Formed in 2004, the Latino organization emphasizes professionalism, community involvement, academic excellence, and social interaction.

"The party was an opportunity for us to get to know the children and the workers," said Olvera, who estimated that about 50 staff members and their children took part.

It was the second year for the celebration, one that Ezekiel predicts will become a tradition at UCSC. "This is going to be a thing that will go on as long as the University is here."
