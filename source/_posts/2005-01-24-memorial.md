The Chancellor's Office and Division of Student Affairs invite all members of the campus community to take part in a memorial on Wednesday, January 26--the one-month anniversary of the devastating tsunami that struck South Asia.

Beginning at noon that day, students, faculty, and staff will be able to contribute messages to the memorial, which will be located in the Quarry Plaza near Bay Tree Bookstore. The informal memorial is intended to enable people to write personal messages on colorful ribbons, which will be displayed in the area. People may contribute messages to the memorial throughout the remainder of the afternoon.

For more information on other events or about ways in which you can donate to the tsunami relief effort, please see [www.ucsc.edu/news_events/tsunami/][1].
