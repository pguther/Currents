Associate professor of history and Oakes College provost Pedro Castillo was recently appointed to the California Council for the Humanities.

The California Council for the Humanities is an independent, nonprofit state affiliate of the National Endowment for the Humanities. Originally a granting organization, the council began to create and manage humanities programs and projects of its own in the early 1990s and is now a leader in statewide humanities programming, with a grants program connected to its programming efforts.

The mission of the council is to foster understanding between people and encourage their engagement in community life through the public use of the humanities.

Castillo, who is also the cofounder and former director of the Chicano/Latino Research Center at UCSC, was appointed by President Clinton to the National Council for the National Endowment for the Humanities in 1999.
