  Associate professor of history and Oakes College provost Pedro Castillo was recently appointed to the California Council for the Humanities.
</p>
<p>
  The California Council for the Humanities is an independent, nonprofit state affiliate of the National Endowment for the Humanities. Originally a granting organization, the council began to create and manage humanities programs and projects of its own in the early 1990s and is now a leader in statewide humanities programming, with a grants program connected to its programming efforts.
</p>
<p>
  The mission of the council is to foster understanding between people and encourage their engagement in community life through the public use of the humanities.
</p>
<p>
  Castillo, who is also the cofounder and former director of the Chicano/Latino Research Center at UCSC, was appointed by President Clinton to the National Council for the National Endowment for the Humanities in 1999.
