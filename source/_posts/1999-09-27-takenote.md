#### Bay Tree Bookstore collecting donations for North Carolina flood victims

A number of campuses in North Carolina have been closed by the floods from Hurricane Floyd. The bookstore at North Carolina Wesleyan College has agreed to act as a distribution conduit for badly needed clothing for students and the public, and they've asked for assistance from other college stores. If you have something extra in the way of clothing that you can contribute to the victims of this natural disaster, the Bay Tree Bookstore will handle the shipping to North Carolina Wesleyan College for distribution. A collection box is located outside the door to the bookstore. For more information, call the Bay Tree Bookstore at (831) 459-4544.

#### EEO/AA Office launching campuswide exit interview program

Over the past year, the number of career employees who have separated from UCSC has doubled from the previous year. To better understand the variables that affect staff employee retention, the EEO/AA Office is launching a campuswide exit interview program starting October 1. At the beginning of each month, the EEO/AA office will send an exit interview questionnaire to all career staff who have separated from the university during the previous month. The option for an in-person interview will be made available, with EEO/AA staff doing those interviews as requested.  
  
After one year of collecting this information, EEO/AA will issue a report with recommendations for action. The interviews will help to identify where improvements can be made to campus climate, management, and conditions of employment for staff. The interviews may help identify the campus's strengths as an employer as well. Units currently conducting exit interviews are encouraged to continue and to use the information to positively impact retention. For more information about the exit interview program, contact Lynda Tanaka at (831) 459-2686, tanaka@cats.ucsc.edu.
