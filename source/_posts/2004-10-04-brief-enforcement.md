Campus police will be participating in a countywide day of stepped-up enforcement of traffic laws throughout campus on October 6.   

Dubbed "BADGES," for "Before Aggressive Drivers Get Everybody Stops," the initiative will target pedestrians, drivers, and bicyclists, and include seat-belt violations and speeding.  

Additional information on campus police is available at the [UCSC Police Department][1] web site.
