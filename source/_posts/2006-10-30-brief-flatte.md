Stanley Flatte, professor emeritus and research professor of physics, will give the Emeriti Faculty Lecture at UCSC on Thursday, November 2. His talk, "World Energy and Power: Facts to Inform your Thinking," will begin at 8 p.m. in the Music Center Recital Hall. This event is free and open to the public.

Flatte will discuss the future of the global energy supply and ways to meet the world's energy needs. Will the world's oil supply dry up in 40 years or 400 years? (Both figures have been suggested.) What can solar, wind, biofuels, hydrogen, fuel cells, and nuclear energy contribute? What can be the role of conservation practices, such as the use of more efficient engines? Flatte will address these questions from a scientific and technological perspective.

Flatte has made important contributions in a variety of fields, including ocean acoustics, atmospheric optics, seismology, and particle physics. He is a fellow of the American Physical Society, the Acoustical Society of America, the Optical Society of America, and the American Association for the Advancement of Science.

Flatte earned his B.S. in physics from the California Institute of Technology and his Ph.D. in physics from UC Berkeley. He joined the UCSC faculty in 1971.
