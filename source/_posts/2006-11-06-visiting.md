  UCSC Alumni Association Distinguished Visiting Professor program is bringing two very different perspectives to campus this month.
</p>
<p>
  "Beyond Therapy: Biotechnology and the Pursuit of Happiness" will be the topic when William B. Hurlbut, a physician and consulting professor of neurology and neurological sciences at Stanford Medical Center, delivers the Crown College 40th Anniversary Distinguished Guest Lecture. The November 13 lecture will be at 7 p.m. in the Music Center Recital Hall.<br>
  <br>
  Hurlbut is the author of numerous publications on science and ethics. He has worked with NASA on projects in astrobiology and is a member of the Chemical and Biological Warfare working group at the Center for International Security and Cooperation. Since 2002 he has served on the President's Council on Bioethics.<br>
  <br>
  He is a proponent of a method of stem-cell procurement, called "altered nuclear transfer," which does not necessitate the destruction of human embryos.<br>
  <br>
  On November 28, Merrill College Distinguished Visiting Professor Ngugi wa Thiong'o will discuss his work in the context of postcolonialism and globalization in Africa.<br>
  <br>
  His lecture will be at 8 p.m. in Classroom Unit 2. A Kenyan teacher, novelist, essayist, and playwright, Thiong'o is a professor of English and comparative literature at UC Irvine, where he directs the International Center for Writing and Translation.<br>
  <br>
  Most recently, he has authored <i>The Wizard of the Crow</i> (Pantheon, 2006), a novel he wrote in Gikuyu, his native tongue, and translated into English.<br>
  <br>
  Both lectures are free. For further information, call (831) 459-2530.
