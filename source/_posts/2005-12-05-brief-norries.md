Find that special toy, unusual plant, cards, jewelry, garden statuary, gifts for the home, and holiday wreaths and decorations. Norrie's also carries an extensive selection of books, including the new book by Todd Newberry, _The Ardent Birder_.

The shop is open daily from 10 a.m. until 4 p.m. Norrie's will close at 2 p.m. on December 24 and remain closed until January 2.
