Students, staff, and faculty members wanting to help out in the community are invited to attend the annual Volunteer Fair from 12:30 to 4 p.m. on Thursday, October 19, in Quarry Plaza.

The event is sponsored by the [Student Volunteer Center][1], which matches students, staff, and faculty members with community organizations.

Representatives of off-campus community organizations will be available to provide information, and a marrow donor registration drive will also be conducted. People wanting to be entered into the National Marrow Donor Program registry may fill out a consent form and have a cheek swab sample taken (no blood sample is needed for the initial testing).   
  
Patients with life-threatening blood diseases such as leukemia and aplastic anemia, as well as certain immune system and genetic disorders, need someone to donate healthy marrow or blood stem cells.

For information about volunteering or the marrow drive, e-mail the [Student Volunteer Center][2].
