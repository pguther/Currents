The City of Santa Cruz will be conducting a mail-ballot election on August 30, asking the following question: "In order to limit further reduction in the City's General Fund, shall that Santa Cruz Municipal Code be amended to add a Chapter imposing a Franchise Tax of 3% on the water utility rate, 3% on the sewer utility rate, and 12% on the refuse utility rate, to replace the comparable Franchise Fee that was recently discontinued?"
