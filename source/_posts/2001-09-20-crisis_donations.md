Student Affairs and students have launched a relief effort for victims of the terrorist attacks, their survivors, and for disaster relief services. Toward that end, they have prepared a number of donation collection cans for the American Red Cross Disaster Relief fund.

They are now looking for on-campus high-traffic offices and facilities where the cans can be placed. They also need volunteers to assume the role of Donation Can Custodian in those locations. Custodian responsibilities will include securing the donations properly and bringing them to the Student Affairs liaison each Friday morning.

This drive will end on October 19, when the total will be compiled and sent to the relief effort in the name of UC Santa Cruz.

To volunteer your location as a collection site, please have your designated Donation Can Custodian, contact Gail Heit ([gheit@cats][1]) (Ext. 9-3456).
