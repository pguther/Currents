#### ![cover art of Encyclopedia of Creativity][1]Ray Gibbs, David Harrington, Pavel Machotka

Three members of UCSC's psychology faculty have contributed entries to the multivolume _Encyclopedia of Creativity_, published by San Diego-based Academic Press. The encyclopedia provides specialized information about virtually all aspects of creativity and was edited to be beneficial to scientists, doctors, inventors, teachers, business leaders, writers, actors, dancers, as well as painters, graphic artists, and architects who will draw inspiration from the life and works of their favorite artists. Among the nearly 200 entries are articles by Professor Ray Gibbs, who wrote an article entitled "Metaphors," Associate Professor David M. Harrington, who authored a piece titled "Conditions and Settings/Environment," and Professor Emeritus Pavel Machotka, who wrote about Paul Cezanne. The encyclopedia's text is enhanced by illustrations and photographs that appear throughout.
