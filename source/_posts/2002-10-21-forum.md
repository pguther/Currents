<p>
  UCSC will hold a public forum on Wednesday, October 23, to discuss a feasibility study for "improvements to UCSC student life facilities."<br>
</p>
<p>
  The meeting will take place<br>
  from 4 to 6 p.m. in Conference Room D on the third floor of the Bay Tree<br>
  Bookstore.
</p>
<p>
  Projects under discussion include the development of a new student union complex at Quarry Plaza, a new indoor multipurpose recreation/events center, improvements to the existing Upper Quarry Amphitheater (seating, restrooms, stage, concessions), and a new playing field for soccer, rugby, and ultimate Frisbee with bleachers and restrooms.
</p>
<p>
  The Student Life Facilities Area Planning and Feasibility Study Committee is also considering the relocation of the current transit hub at Quarry Plaza to create a more pedestrian-friendly area, as well as the construction of two new pedestrian bridges to improve access from the west campus.
</p>
<p>
  "We received information from focus groups last spring, and we are now entering a new phase of the feasibility study," noted Associate Vice Chancellor Gail Heit. "We have results from our consulting team about program scope, siting, and cost, and this will be presented on Wednesday. We will use any additional information learned at the forum to fine-tune an online survey on this topic that will go out to all students in the next couple of weeks."
</p>
<p>
  Heit said that the public forum is open to everyone, providing an opportunity for students, staff, and faculty to express their opinions about improvements to student facilities that they would like to see take place in the coming years.
</p>
<p>
  "No decisions have been made," Heit added. "We just want to get a sense of what facilities and programs students, in particular, are interested in seeing developed in the future."
