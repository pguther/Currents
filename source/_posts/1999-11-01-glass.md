Julie Glass, a math instructor at California State University, Hayward, who received her master's and doctorate degrees in mathematics from UCSC, has been named the 1999 California Professor of the Year by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. Glass, 32, has been an assistant professor at CSU Hayward since 1994. She hosts a cable television program devoted to college algebra, has authored math-oriented children's books, and is cofounder of a math and science day camp for school-age girls. She teaches two courses at CSU Hayward: introduction to proofs and math for business and social scientists. Glass has appeared on two programs on the university's local cable television station, CNTV: "Math on TV," a video course to help high school students prepare for mathematics placement exams, which ran for two years; and "College Algebra," a course offered for college credit, which also has an Internet component allowing students to interact with the instructor. The Carnegie Foundation, based in Palo Alto, established the Professor of the Year program in 1981 in cooperation with the Council for Advancement and Support of Education.
