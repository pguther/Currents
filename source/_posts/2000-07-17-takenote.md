#### University Extension seeking host families

The Foundation for Worldwide International Student Exchange (WISE) is seeking host families for international students attending the [English Language International][1] programs at University Extension. Host families must be able to provide a private room with a bed, desk, place to store clothing, adequate lighting for study--and most importantly, a safe and caring environment. Hosts may be single, single parents, retired couples, and couples with, or without, children.

Families are paid a stipend of between $20 and $25 per night, depending on the student's meal plan and length of stay. The program director provides counseling and guidance to host families and students throughout the term of homestay. WISE carries liability insurance to protect families against any claim not covered by their homeowner's insurance.  
  
For more information, contact Harriet Tower, WISE program director, at (831) 685-0260 or e-mail wise@cruzio.com.
