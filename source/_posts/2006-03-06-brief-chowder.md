  Cooks from UCSC Dining were among the top winners at the Santa Cruz Clam Chowder Cook-Off and Festival last month at the Beach Boardwalk.
</p>
<p>
  Two teams from UCSC, the Chowder Slugs and the Redwood Sluggers, were among the 50 teams that came from as far away as Huntington Beach, Sacramento, and Stockton to prepare gallons of their most delectable Manhattan and New England-style clam chowders.
</p>
<p>
  The Chowder Slugs, for the second year in a row, took away first prize for their New England chowder in the corporate category and won the overall People's Choice Award. Team members were Dwight Collins (captain), Wade Garza, Scott Berlin, and Bill Prime.
</p>
<p>
  The Redwood Sluggers--Kent Bailey (captain), Amanda Jenkins, Debby Carroll, and Dennis Wake--won third place in the Restaurant Division with their Manhattan clam chowder.
