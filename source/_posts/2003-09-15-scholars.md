This year's recipients of the annual Karl S. Pister Leadership Opportunity Awards $20,000 scholarships include two single mothers, a Pakistani immigrant, and an aspiring computer engineer.

All recipients receive a $10,000 scholarship for each of two years, as well as the support of a strong academic mentoring program and assistance finding paid summer work experience in a field that complements their studies.   

The scholarships were created to foster the transfer of accomplished students from community colleges in the UCSC region. The program was designed by former UCSC Chancellor Karl S. Pister to make the university accessible to the most promising community college students in the area.  

"UC Santa Cruz is proud to welcome these students to our campus," said UCSC Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood. "They bring focus, motivation, and a depth of life experience that enriches the campus community."  

The scholarship program recognizes students who have made a demonstrated commitment to assisting and improving the lives of others, who have overcome adverse socioeconomic circumstances, and who might not otherwise be able to attend UCSC for financial reasons. Candidates are nominated by the presidents of each of 13 regional community colleges, and recipients are selected by the chancellor in consultation with the Leadership Opportunity Awards Program Screening Committee.
