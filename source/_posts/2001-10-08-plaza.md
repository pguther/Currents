**Quarry Plaza gets official welcome on October 12**

**Celebration includes drawing for free iMac computer, refreshments, tours**

Quarry Plaza will make its official debut on Friday, October 12, in an event featuring live music, a drawing for an iMac computer, refreshments, tours, and daylong discounts at the bookstore.

The grand opening celebration and open house, from 1 to 5 p.m., will showcase the new, expanded Bay Tree Bookstore and the Graduate Commons, which is providing a base for graduate students as well as a new site for the Whole Earth Restaurant.

Tours of both buildings, including the Career Center on the third floor of the bookstore building, will be offered.  
  
The University Events Office, Bay Tree Bookstore, and the Graduate Student Association are sponsoring the event.  
  
All graduate students are invited to a dedication ceremony and reception beginning at 1 p.m. in the Graduate Student Commons Lounge. They have plenty to celebrate; graduate students at UCSC have been setting aside money for the building since 1965.   
  
With office space a problem for many UCSC graduate students, the commons offers a place where graduate students can check their e-mail, use the phone, hold office hours, socialize with other graduate students, conduct review sessions, or just relax between classes.

The Graduate Commons facilities manager, Diane Brookes, may be reached at (831) 459-1395. There is also a Graduate Student Commons [web site][1] and [e-mail][2] account.  
  
The move to the first floor of the Graduate Commons has brought some changes to the Whole Earth Restaurant, which has expanded its menu and now includes a coffee bar, carryout window, and pool table area.  
  
Bay Tree Bookstore's airy new quarters include nearly four times as much space for books other than textbooks and about 50 percent more space for textbooks. The selection of cards and dorm supplies has been expanded, and a photo-developing service has been added. In addition to the drawing for an i-Mac 500 desktop computer, all UCSC emblematic apparel, including hats, will be 20 percent off on October 12.  
  
Next to the bookstore is the Express Store, a convenience store with candy, snacks, sandwiches, and coffee, as well as health products and other items. Three other outlets share the bookstore building: the relocated Copy Center, the book-buyback area, and the ID card office.   
  
Parking is extremely limited at Quarry Plaza, so those attending the celebration are being encouraged to walk or take shuttles.
