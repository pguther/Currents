Michael Cowan, a professor of American studies and literature, has been named to the position of vice chair of the Academic Council. The council is the steering committee of the universitywide Academic Senate, which serves all nine of UC's academic campuses.   
  
Cowan will hold the position for a year before stepping into the position of chair of the Academic Council--the most important office in the statewide Academic Senate. Cowan's appointment was effective September 1.  
  
Cowan has a long record of administrative service and commitment to academic excellence. Since he joined UCSC in 1969, he has served as dean of humanities and arts (from 1983 to 1989); founding chair of the American Studies Department in 1978 and chair again in 1990-99; and chair of the Academic Senate of UCSC in 1978-79 and 1994-96 (making him the only person to serve twice on the UCSC senate). In 1978-79 he was provost of Merrill College.   
  
In 1997, Cowan received the UCSC Academic Senate's inaugural Dean E. McHenry prize--an award given every other year to acknowledge outstanding service. He is past president (1984-86) and an active member of the National American Studies Association.
