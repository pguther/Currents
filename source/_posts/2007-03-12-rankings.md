In a comparative study, the Faculty Scholarly Productivity Index ranked UCSC doctoral programs in music and in environmental health engineering third in the nation in scholarly faculty productivity. At UCSC, environmental health engineering research takes place primarily in the Environmental Toxicology Department.

The Faculty Scholarly Productivity Index, partly financed by the State University of New York at Stony Brook and produced by [Academic Analytics][1], rated faculty members' scholarly output at nearly 7,300 doctoral programs. The index, based on 2005 data, judged productivity on publications, including citations; federal-grant dollars awarded; and awards and honors. The rankings were reported in the January 12 issue of the [_Chronicle of Higher Education][2]_.
