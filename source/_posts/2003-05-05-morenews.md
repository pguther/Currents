</p>
<p>
  Chris McKay, a planetary scientist at NASA Ames Research Center, will give a free public lecture on Wednesday, May 7. The lecture, "From Antarctica to Mars: The Search for Life," starts at 7:30 p.m. in the Seymour Center at Long Marine Lab.
</p>
<p>
  Mars appears to be a cold, dry, and dead world. But there is good evidence that early in its history it had liquid water, more active volcanism, and a thicker atmosphere. Mars had this Earthlike environment over three and a half billion years ago, during the same time that life appeared on Earth. The main question in the exploration of Mars, therefore, is the search for an independent origin of life on that planet.
</p>
<p>
  Ecosystems in cold, dry locations on Earth--such as the Antarctic--provide examples of how life on Mars might have survived and where to look for fossils. But finding fossils on Mars, while it would be a stunning discovery, would not be enough to determine if life on Mars had a separate origin from life on Earth. For that, researchers will need to find intact Martian life, possibly frozen in the deep old permafrost.<br>
</p>
<p>
  This free talk is cosponsored by UCSC's Division of Physical and Biological Sciences, the Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics (IGPP), and the Center for the Origin, Dynamics, and Evolution of Planets (CODEP). For special accommodation call (831) 459-1235.<br>

</p>
<p>
  The University Research Library in the 21st Century" will be the topic of a campus forum scheduled for May 9, from 1 to 3 p.m. at the University Center Alumni Room. Featured guests will include Sarah Pritchard, university librarian at UC Santa Barbara; Daniel Greenstein, university librarian and executive director at the California Digital Library; Peter Lyman, professor and associate dean at UC Berkeley's School of Information Management and Systems; and Carla Stoffle, dean of libraries and the Center for Creative Photography at the University of Arizona Library.<br>
  <br>
  As the University of California embarks on a trajectory of profound growth, UCSC has a unique opportunity to shape its future. The campus has recently completed a detailed long-range planning process that visualizes what the campus community will become over the next decade. The library will play a crucial role in supporting the programmatic development expected in the future, which will likely include a doubling of graduate student enrollment and important research initiatives. The four distinguished panelists at the forum will discuss how information is exchanged, managed, and regulated--paying particular attention to the intersection of libraries and dramatic new technological developments.<br>
