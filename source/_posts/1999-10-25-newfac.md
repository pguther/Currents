#### ![][1]Tyrus Miller

Assistant Professor of Literature

Tyrus Miller's areas of specialty are modern poetry and fiction, especially British, American, Austrian, and German literature. He also studies the art and culture of the avant-garde and is interested in artists whose work uses more than one medium. His book, _Late Modernism: Politics, Fiction and the Arts between the World Wars,_ was published this year by the University of California Press. He earned a B.A. and M.A. in humanities and an M.A. in creative writing from Johns Hopkins University and a Ph.D. in English from Stanford University.
