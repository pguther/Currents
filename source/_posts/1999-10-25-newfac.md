  Tyrus Miller's areas of specialty are modern poetry and fiction, especially British, American, Austrian, and German literature. He also studies the art and culture of the avant-garde and is interested in artists whose work uses more than one medium. His book, <i>Late Modernism: Politics, Fiction and the Arts between the World Wars,</i> was published this year by the University of California Press. He earned a B.A. and M.A. in humanities and an M.A. in creative writing from Johns Hopkins University and a Ph.D. in English from Stanford University.
