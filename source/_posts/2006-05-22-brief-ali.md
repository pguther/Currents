What happens when an actor, former boxer, and lifelong fan of the world's most recognizable cultural icon actually gets to meet his hero face-to-face, while working on the epic motion picture that bears his name? Well, if you're comedian/actor/impressionist Vincent Cook and your hero is the legendary three-time world heavyweight boxing champion/humanitarian Muhammad Ali, magic happens--magic and a heartfelt labor of love.

_In Ali: The Man, The Myth, The Peoples' Champion,_ comedian and master impressionist Vincent Cook steps off the comedy stage and brings his unique talent to the theater in this one-man show that goes beyond the stories, feature films and documentaries and digs into the soul of the man loved and respected by millions.

Cook brings his show to Stevenson College at 8 pm. Wednesday, May 24. Admission is free. For more information, call (831) 459-4844.
