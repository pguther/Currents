  What happens when an actor, former boxer, and lifelong fan of the world's most recognizable cultural icon actually gets to meet his hero face-to-face, while working on the epic motion picture that bears his name? Well, if you're comedian/actor/impressionist Vincent Cook and your hero is the legendary three-time world heavyweight boxing champion/humanitarian Muhammad Ali, magic happens--magic and a heartfelt labor of love.

<p>
  <i>In Ali: The Man, The Myth, The Peoples' Champion,</i> comedian and master impressionist Vincent Cook steps off the comedy stage and brings his unique talent to the theater in this one-man show that goes beyond the stories, feature films and documentaries and digs into the soul of the man loved and respected by millions.

<p>
  Cook brings his show to Stevenson College at 8 pm. Wednesday, May 24. Admission is free. For more information, call (831) 459-4844.
