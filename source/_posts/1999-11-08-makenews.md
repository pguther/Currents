**Stan Woosley, **professor and chair of astronomy and astrophysics, and his  
graduate student **Andrew MacFadyen** were featured in a _U.S. News and World  
Report_ story about gamma ray bursts. The article discussed new observations  
that support Woosley and MacFadyen's theories regarding the origins of  
gamma ray bursts. Their research is also the subject of an article on NASA's new [Space Science News Web site][1].   
  
In a talk at the Missouri Botanical Garden last month, professor of biology **Lynda Goff** caught the attention of a reporter for the _St. Louis Post-Dispatch._ Goff described her research on parasitism in red algae as "Borg biology" (a reference to an alien race in the television series _Star Trek: The Next Generation)_ because of the way the parasites take over and transform the cells of their hosts.  
  
_New Scientist_ magazine's cover story on October 16 focused on efforts by UCSC researchers, led by professor of chemistry and biochemistry **David Deamer**, and another group at Harvard University to develop nanopore technology for superfast DNA sequencing.

**Ellen Moir** of the New Teacher Center was on Pasadena radio station KPCC with California Education Secretary Gary Hart last week. . . . Also on southern California's airwaves was **Mike Urban** of politics, who was heard on Pacifica Radio's KPFK Radio in Los Angeles discussing Russia, the Chechen war, and Russian elections.

Rounding out the southern California media wave was **Manuel Pastor **of Latin American and Latino studies, who coauthored an opinion piece for the _Los Angeles Times_ about environmental justice. . . . More locally, **Pastor** participated in a Watsonville "visioning" forum on that community's future.
