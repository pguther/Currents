### **Tandy Beal awarded arts grants**

Theater arts instructor Tandy Beal has received two new grants to support her work with her company, one from the California Arts Council and another from the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA). The California Arts Council has awarded her a $24,900 grant for a project combining dance, circus, and the a cappella group SoVoSo. They will be doing a show at the Mello Center in Watsonville that will have an outreach component with Watsonville High School students. This project will also tour outside of the county, bringing together internationally known artists in circus, dance, and music, as well as community members.

The NEA has given Tandy Beal and Company a $10,000 grant to support dance in the community. She will use part of this grant to help produce "Listening to the Earth" at UCSC. The production includes UCSC students working with children in the community. The grant will help pay for the professional artists who will work alongside the students.

In addition, Beal has been invited to perform her solo work at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in November.

### Two ES grad students receive $13,000 fellowships

Two UCSC graduate students in environmental studies have been awarded $13,000 fellowships to support their doctoral work.

Elizabeth Herbert and Christopher Bacon, both Ph.D. candidates in environmental studies, have received 14th annual Switzer Environmental Fellowships, one of the nation's most prestigious awards for early-career environmental leaders. Herbert and Bacon are among 20 students from universities in California and New England who received the fellowships this year. Each year, 20 young environmental champions are awarded $13,000 each from the Robert and Patricia Switzer Foundation to complete master's and doctoral degrees that address critical conservation challenges.

Herbert's work focuses on community participation and forest management policy in the coastal watersheds of central and northern California, Oregon, and Washington. Bacon is evaluating the impacts of fair-trade certification on small-scale farmers and coffee production as part of his larger investigation of linkages between agroecology, global markets, and struggles for rural livelihoods. A consultant to international coffee development projects, Bacon serves as a member of the Quality Coffee Task Force, as academic liaison to the Specialty Coffee Association of America, and as a collaborator in the UCSC Sustainable Coffee Working Group.

The Switzer Foundation invests in individual leadership to improve environmental quality. Lissa Widoff, executive director of the foundation, said fellowships target those who are applying their problem-solving abilities in efforts to "implement positive change in the environmental realm." The fellowships are merit-based and very competitive. Candidates are nominated by their academic institution or by environmental experts. The foundation was established in 1985. The first Switzer Environmental Fellowships were awarded in 1988.
