Weixin Cheng is a soil ecologist whose research addresses issues of global environmental change. Cheng specializes in below-ground carbon cycles and microbial activity. Last fall, he began an NSF-funded pilot project to test a new technique of measuring the movement of carbon in a forest ecosystem. If successful, the technique could ultimately aid efforts to ameliorate global warming. Cheng earned his Ph.D. in ecology from the University of Georgia's Institute of Ecology and his undergraduate degree from Northeast Agricultural College in Harbin, China. He comes to UCSC from Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge, where he was an assistant professor of biology.
