The UCSC Police Department has released its report on campus crime statistics for the 2000 year. The statistics are part of an annual report titled, "Crime Awareness & Campus Security: Student, Staff & Faculty 'Right-to-Know.'"   
  
In addition to the crime statistics, the report contains information on the campus's policy on weapons (none are allowed without written permission from the chancellor or an equivalent authority); reporting on sexual assault, rape, or sexual harassment; tips on safety; and information about resources available to faculty, staff, and students.   
  
The report is [available][1] on the web.
