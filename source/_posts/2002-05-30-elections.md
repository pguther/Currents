<p>
  UCSC students have voted to increase transit fees and renovate the campus radio station, but rejected two other fee increases. The online balloting took place May 13-22.
</p>
<p>
  Measure 1, the transist initiative, was for a $10 a quarter increase in the Student Transit Fee. Transporation and Parking Services said the increase would allow more buses and the addition of "on demand" late-night servie on Friday and Saturday nights.
</p>
<p>
  Measure 2, a Campus Student Government fee increase, and Measure 3, to create a campuswide student-directed programming board, failed.
</p>
<p>
  Measure 4 was for renovation and equipment improvements at campus radio station KZSC.
</p>
<p>
  Measure 1 and Measure 4 must receive the approval of the Board of Regents before the new fees are imposed. That approval will be sought at the July Regents meeting, with the expectation that the new fees will begin in the fall quarter.
</p>
<p>
  Students also voted on serveral other issues that did not involve fee increases. More detailed information is available <a href="http://elections.ucsc.edu/elections/results.html">online.</a>
