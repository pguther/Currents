UCSC Chancellor Denice D. Denton and Yun Soo Mok, president of Korea's Pukyong University, signed a five-year cooperation agreement June 5 at the University Center.

Pukyong University was formed in 1996 when two national universities, National Fisheries University of Pusan and Pusan National University of Technology, merged.

Pukyong University is known for its research and expertise in the marine products industry, oceanography, and fishery science.

UCSC and Pukyong University agreed to exchanges of students, staff, and faculty, and cooperation in research projects. A group of students from Pukyong University will be attending UCSC Extension's intensive English program for four weeks this summer in downtown Santa Cruz. The program draws students from throughout the world.
