  Leading faculty and researchers in the Baskin School of Engineering will present their latest findings during a Research Review Day on Monday, May 5. Engineering research at UCSC is concentrated in the areas of information technology, biotechnology, and nanotechnology.
</p>
<p>
  The event will take place in the University Center at Colleges Nine and Ten. There will be two sessions of research presentations, a morning session from 9 to 10:30 a.m. and an afternoon session from 1:30 to 3 p.m. Graduate students will present posters describing their latest projects from 3 to 4 p.m.
</p>
<p>
  The research review sessions are open to the public, but space is limited and advance registration is required. If you would like to attend, please <a href="http://www.soe.ucsc.edu/rrd">register online.</a> A complete list of speakers and schedule of events are also available at this web site.<br>
</p>
<p>
  No parking is available at the University Center, so visitors should park at the Barn Theater by the main campus entrance and ride the shuttle to the University Center.<br>
</p>
<p>
  In addition to the research review, the engineering school will be celebrating rapid progress on the construction of the new Engineering 2 Building, scheduled for completion in fall 2004. A special "Hard Hat Tour" of the construction site will take place from 11 a.m. to noon.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The $62 million Engineering 2 Building will provide 70,000 square feet for teaching and research. The building will also contain an additional 20,000 square feet for two of the California Institutes for Science and Innovation established in 2000 by Governor Gray Davis: the Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society (CITRIS) and the Institute for Quantitative Biomedical Research (QB3). The institute space will serve as an incubator for transforming the engineering school's information technology, biotechnology, and nanotechnology research outcomes into next-generation industry products and services.<br>
