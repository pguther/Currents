The UCSC Opera Program has been honored with the National Opera Association's "Opera Production Award" for its production of Benjamin Britten's _A Midsummer Night's Dream_ last year. Music lecturer and program director Brian Staufenbiel traveled to New York last month to represent the UCSC Music Department and accept the award at the opera association's 52nd Annual Convention.

"It was a great pleasure and honor to receive the award for the music department and the opera program," said Staufenbiel. "This is a very important step in the development of our opera program and in building national recognition for the high quality of productions we do here at UCSC."
