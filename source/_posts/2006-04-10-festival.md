  Award-winning documentary filmmaker Renee Tajima-Pena's film <i>Labor Women</i> will be screened during the fifth annual Reel Work May Day Labor Film Festival, which takes place April 20-May 1 in Santa Cruz, Watsonville, and San Jose.
</p>
<p>
  A 35-minute documentary, <i>Labor Women</i> is a portrait of three immigrant daughters who are part of the new American labor movement.
</p>
<p>
  Tajima-Pena, associate professor of community studies at UCSC, will discuss her film and facilitate a panel talk with student activist filmmakers at Kresge Town Hall on Wednesday, April 26. Tajima-Pena directed the Oscar-nominated film <i>Who Killed Vincent Chin?</i> and the Sundance Film Festival Winner, <i>My America: Honk If You Love Buddha</i>.
</p>
<p>
  In its fifth year, the film festival is an all-volunteer-organized event; admission to all screenings is by donation. Full schedule information is available at <a href="http://www.reelwork.org">reelwork.org.</a>
</p>
<p>
  UCSC will also host an activist documentary filmmaking workshop April 28 with noted Chicano filmmaker Paul Espinosa, a professor of Chicana and Chicano studies at Arizona State University. Espinosa will screen his new film about Latino labor in Los Angeles during the festival's events in Watsonville that evening.
</p>
<p>
  Other highlights of the festival, coordinated by Paul Ortiz, associate professor of community studies at UCSC, include:
</p>
<p>
  * The regional premiere of the acclaimed documentary on the GI resistance movement against the Vietnam War, <i>Sir! No Sir!</i> The film will be screened at the Del Mar Theater in downtown Santa Cruz on Thursday, April 27, with commentary by a panel of antiwar veterans who appear in the film.
</p>
<p>
  * A matinee screening Sunday, April 30, of the Golden Globe and Academy Award-nominated film <i>North Country</i> starring Charlize Theron, which tells the story of the first successful class-action workplace sexual harassment case in the United States. Two women miners from the Minnesota iron-mining region will offer commentary on the representation of women and sexism in the film.
</p>
<p>
  * The premiere of <i>Meeting Face to Face</i>, a film about a visit to the United States by Iraqi trade unionists.
</p>
<p>
  "We are proud to bring together films, labor unionists, and members of the public to promote social justice activism and international solidarity," said Ortiz.
