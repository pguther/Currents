Award-winning documentary filmmaker Renee Tajima-Pena's film _Labor Women _will be screened during the fifth annual Reel Work May Day Labor Film Festival, which takes place April 20-May 1 in Santa Cruz, Watsonville, and San Jose.

A 35-minute documentary, _Labor Women_ is a portrait of three immigrant daughters who are part of the new American labor movement.

Tajima-Pena, associate professor of community studies at UCSC, will discuss her film and facilitate a panel talk with student activist filmmakers at Kresge Town Hall on Wednesday, April 26. Tajima-Pena directed the Oscar-nominated film _Who Killed Vincent Chin? _and the Sundance Film Festival Winner, _My America: Honk If You Love Buddha_.

In its fifth year, the film festival is an all-volunteer-organized event; admission to all screenings is by donation. Full schedule information is available at [reelwork.org.][1]

UCSC will also host an activist documentary filmmaking workshop April 28 with noted Chicano filmmaker Paul Espinosa, a professor of Chicana and Chicano studies at Arizona State University. Espinosa will screen his new film about Latino labor in Los Angeles during the festival's events in Watsonville that evening.

Other highlights of the festival, coordinated by Paul Ortiz, associate professor of community studies at UCSC, include:

* The regional premiere of the acclaimed documentary on the GI resistance movement against the Vietnam War, _Sir! No Sir!_ The film will be screened at the Del Mar Theater in downtown Santa Cruz on Thursday, April 27, with commentary by a panel of antiwar veterans who appear in the film.
* A matinee screening Sunday, April 30, of the Golden Globe and Academy Award-nominated film _North Country _starring Charlize Theron, which tells the story of the first successful class-action workplace sexual harassment case in the United States. Two women miners from the Minnesota iron-mining region will offer commentary on the representation of women and sexism in the film.
* The premiere of _Meeting Face to Face_, a film about a visit to the United States by Iraqi trade unionists.

"We are proud to bring together films, labor unionists, and members of the public to promote social justice activism and international solidarity," said Ortiz.
