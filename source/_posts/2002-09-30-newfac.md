New Faculty

Patrick Chuang  
Assistant Professor of Earth Sciences

Patrick Chuang studies atmospheric chemistry: what the atmosphere is made of, how it's changing, what processes are important in transforming it, and what effects will result from these changes. His primary research interest is the interaction between aerosols (atmospheric particles) and climate, including the interactions between aerosols and clouds, precipitation, radiation, atmospheric chemistry, and human and ecosystem health. Chuang earned his B.S. in chemical engineering from the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada, and and his M.S. and Ph.D. in environmental engineering science from the California Institute of Technology. Before joining the UCSC faculty, he worked at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado.

Christopher Edwards  
Assistant Professor of Ocean Sciences

Christopher Edwards studies physical oceanography and numerical modeling of coastal- and basin-scale dynamics. He earned a B.A. in physics from Haverford College and a Ph.D. in physical oceanography from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution. Before joining the UCSC faculty, he was an assistant research professor of marine sciences at the University of Connecticut.
