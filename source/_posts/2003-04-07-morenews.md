  <a name="lawsuit" id="lawsuit"></a>UC will pursue AOL Time Warner lawsuit in California state court<br>
</p>
<p>
  The University of California will file an action in California state court against AOL Time Warner Inc., its directors and officers, its auditor, Ernst &amp; Young LLP, and the financial advisers involved in the 2001 AOL Time Warner merger, Citigroup, Salomon Smith Barney, and Morgan Stanley Inc., claiming securities fraud arising out of the collapse in the price of AOL Time Warner stock. UC's Board of Regents authorized the move at its meeting in San Francisco on April 3.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The university's complaint will allege that AOL materially misrepresented its revenues and number of subscribers during the period prior to and immediately after its January 2001 merger with Time Warner Inc.<br>
</p>
<p>
  At the time of the merger, UC owned more than 11.3 million shares of Time Warner stock worth approximately $800 million, and no shares of AOL. The reduction in the value of UC's investment as a result of the subsequent decline in AOL Time Warner's share price is in excess of $450 million.
