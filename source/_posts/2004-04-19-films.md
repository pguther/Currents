  Community studies major Evelyn Richards discovered the powerful medium of film while making her first-ever documentary about local solidarity efforts for striking grocery workers in southern California.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "It's incredible," said Richards, who collaborated with community studies major Jamie Radenbaugh to make <i>Starting with Health Care: Building Solidarity in the Safeway Struggle.</i>
</p>
<p>
  After viewing several student projects produced during last quarter's class, <i>Video Production of the Social Documentary,</i> including documentaries about a local dog park and the campaign to change UCSC food-service providers, Richards said, "I feel really close to all those issues now."<br>

  * Film festival coorganizer Paul Ortiz, assistant professor of community studies, will discuss <i>Germinal,</i> a 1993 French classic about the struggles of coal miners.<br>
