  The Bay Tree Bookstore will host a book signing by Gary Griggs, professor of Earth and planetary sciences, and Deepika Shrestha Ross, the authors of the new book <i>Then &amp; Now: Santa Cruz Coast</i> (Arcadia, 2006). The event will take place on Thursday, November 30, at 2 p.m.
</p>
<p>
  The book juxtaposes historic photographs with photographs taken from the same locations today, showing how the Santa Cruz coastline has evolved and changed, sometimes dramatically, over the past century. For more information about the book, see the <a href="http://press.ucsc.edu/text.asp?pid=946">UCSC press release</a>.

  The book-signing is part of a continuing Bay Tree Bookstore series showcasing faculty and staff authors. Light refreshments will be provided.
