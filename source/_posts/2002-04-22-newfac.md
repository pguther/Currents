**Amy Beal  
**Assistant Professor, Music  
  

Amy Beal's research focuses on American experimental and avant-garde music of the 20th century, particularly during the post-World War II era in West Germany. She won the 2001 American Musicological Society's Alfred Einstein Award, which was established 34 years ago to honor an article of exceptional merit by a scholar in the early stages of his or her career. Beal's award-winning article, "Negotiating Cultural Allies: American Music in Darmstadt, 1946-1956" (published in the _Journal of the American Musicological Society_), is the first on American music to receive the Einstein Award.  
  
Prior to her appointment at UCSC, Beal was an assistant professor of music at Bates College. She received her bachelor's and master's of music in piano performance from the University of Kansas and her M.A. and Ph.D. in musicology from the University of Michigan.
