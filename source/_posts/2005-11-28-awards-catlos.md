Associate professor of history Brian Catlos has been named co-winner of the 2005 John Edwin Fagg Prize from the American Historical Association for his book _The Victors and the Vanquished: Christians and Muslims in Catalonia and Aragon, 1050-1300_ (Cambridge University Press, 2004) (see [Currents article][1]). The prize is awarded annually for the best publication on the history of Spain, Portugal, or Latin America.

Catlos joined the faculty at UCSC in 2002 after spending six years in Barcelona where he was a research fellow at the Spanish National Research Council and held a postdoctoral fellowship through Boston University. He was recently granted advance tenure and awarded a $25,000 grant from the UC President's Research Fellowships in the Humanities to continue his work in the academic year.
