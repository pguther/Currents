More than 1,000 students are expected to attend a forum for diversity in graduate education on Saturday, April 13, at UCSC.

The 12th annual California Forum for Diversity in Graduate Education will take place from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m.

The forum is designed to reach college juniors, seniors, and master's students throughout northern California and to encourage students from ethnic groups that have been historically underrepresented in higher education to attend graduate school.

A series of workshops will cover various aspects of doctoral study, including how to apply, obtain financial support, prepare for the GRE, and succeed in a doctoral program.

"UC Santa Cruz is proud to be hosting the forum this year," said Frank Talamantes, professor of endocrinology at UCSC and vice provost and dean of Graduate Studies. "The forum has a long history of acquainting underrepresented students with the academic challenges and career opportunities associated with graduate school, and allowing recruiters to tap the growing pool of highly qualified undergraduate and master's-level students."

The forum features faculty panels in which two or three presenters discuss what it takes to prepare for admission to a doctoral program in particular disciplines, what is entailed in doing a doctorate in the field, and what academic and nonacademic career opportunities are available. About 120 recruiters from schools across the country will attend the event.

Participants are expected from UC Berkeley, UC Davis, UCSC, the 10 northern CSU campuses, and many of the northern California private schools, including Stanford University, the University of San Francisco, Mills College, and University of the Pacific. A select group of community college students has also been invited. Invitations are issued on the basis of academic standing and interest in graduate study.

Roberto Cruz, president of National Hispanic University, will deliver the keynote address during the opening session.
