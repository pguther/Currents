Publications

Five UCSC professors collaborate on _Chicana Feminisms_  

A new book, _Chicana Feminisms,_ was edited by five UCSC faculty members who share a personal and intellectual interest in the diversity of Chicana experience. Publication of the book will be celebrated on Tuesday, October 21, from 4 to 6 p.m. in the UCSC Women's Center. The event is free and open to the public.  

_Chicana Feminisms_ (Durham, N.C.: Duke University Press, 2003) presents a series of essays that draw on anthropology, folklore, history, literature, and psychology in a dialogue format, with each essay followed by a response from another scholar.   

Each of the five editors is a member of UCSC's Chicana/Latina Feminisms Research Cluster, affiliated with the campus Chicano/Latino Research Center (CLRC). The center is dedicated to cross-border perspectives linking the Americas. _Chicana Feminisms_ was edited by Gabriela Arredondo, assistant professor of Latin American and Latina/o studies; Aida Hurtado, professor of psychology; Norma Klahn, professor of literature; Olga Najera-Ramirez, professor of anthropology; and Patricia Zavella, professor of Latin American and Latina/o studies.  

Other UCSC contributors include Rosa Linda Fregoso, professor of Latin American and Latina/Latino studies, who authored an essay titled "Reproduction and Miscegenation on the Borderlands: Mapping the Maternal Body of Tejanas," and Jennifer Gonzalez, assistant professor of history of art and visual culture.

Essay by music professor Leta Miller included in new five-CD box set

![][1]A lengthy scholarly essay by musicologist, biographer, and professor of music Leta Miller has been included in a new five-CD box set titled _Music from the ONCE Festival_. Released in September by New World Records, the compilation contains six hours of music from the legendary 1960s avant-garde festival held annually in Ann Arbor, Michigan.   

ONCE was cofounded by UCSC music professor emeritus Gordon Mumma, along with three music colleagues, to create a forum for the presentation of cutting-edge new music. Miller's essay is part of a 140-page booklet that features numerous rare photographs from the festival.
