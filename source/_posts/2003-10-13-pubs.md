  <span class="sectionhead"><a name="chicana" id="chicana"></a>Five UCSC professors collaborate on <i>Chicana Feminisms</i></span><br>
</p>
<p>
  A new book, <i>Chicana Feminisms,</i> was edited by five UCSC faculty members who share a personal and intellectual interest in the diversity of Chicana experience. Publication of the book will be celebrated on Tuesday, October 21, from 4 to 6 p.m. in the UCSC Women's Center. The event is free and open to the public.<br>
</p>
<p>
  <i>Chicana Feminisms</i> (Durham, N.C.: Duke University Press, 2003) presents a series of essays that draw on anthropology, folklore, history, literature, and psychology in a dialogue format, with each essay followed by a response from another scholar.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Each of the five editors is a member of UCSC's Chicana/Latina Feminisms Research Cluster, affiliated with the campus Chicano/Latino Research Center (CLRC). The center is dedicated to cross-border perspectives linking the Americas. <i>Chicana Feminisms</i> was edited by Gabriela Arredondo, assistant professor of Latin American and Latina/o studies; Aida Hurtado, professor of psychology; Norma Klahn, professor of literature; Olga Najera-Ramirez, professor of anthropology; and Patricia Zavella, professor of Latin American and Latina/o studies.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Other UCSC contributors include Rosa Linda Fregoso, professor of Latin American and Latina/Latino studies, who authored an essay titled "Reproduction and Miscegenation on the Borderlands: Mapping the Maternal Body of Tejanas," and Jennifer Gonzalez, assistant professor of history of art and visual culture.<br>

  <img align="right" height="179" src="../art/once_festival_cover.200.jpg" width="200" alt="">A lengthy scholarly essay by musicologist, biographer, and professor of music Leta Miller has been included in a new five-CD box set titled <i>Music from the ONCE Festival</i>. Released in September by New World Records, the compilation contains six hours of music from the legendary 1960s avant-garde festival held annually in Ann Arbor, Michigan.<br>
</p>
<p>
  ONCE was cofounded by UCSC music professor emeritus Gordon Mumma, along with three music colleagues, to create a forum for the presentation of cutting-edge new music. Miller's essay is part of a 140-page booklet that features numerous rare photographs from the festival.<br>
