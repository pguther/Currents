  <a name="UC" id="UC"></a>UC settles with Arthur Andersen's international firms in Enron lawsuit
</h3>
<p>
  On behalf of Enron Corp. investors, the University of California has tentatively reached, subject to the approval of certain of the principals and the court, a $40 million settlement with Arthur Andersen's international umbrella organization in the Enron securities and pension class action suits.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Andersen Worldwide, SC and its non-U.S. member firms will be released from liability and dismissed from the suit; the U.S. firm (Arthur Andersen LLP) and its members will not be released and will remain in the suit.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "This substantial settlement is a favorable result for the class in light of the limited role of the non-U.S. Andersen entities, and represents one of the more substantial securities recoveries from an accounting firm," said James E. Holst, University of California general counsel. "We regard this settlement as only a first step in obtaining recovery for the class, and will continue to pursue damages from the remaining defendants, most of whom had far deeper involvement in the Enron debacle than the overseas Andersen firms."<br>
  <br>
  The settlement is subject to court approval. The settlement funds will eventually be divided among class members on the basis of an allocation formula that estimates their pro-rata share of total class damages. The division of the Andersen payment between the securities and pension classes will also be determined later. <a href="http://www.ucop.edu/news/archives/2002/aug27art1.htm">See full story.</a>

  UCSC firefighters get help battling grass fire
</h3>
<p>
  Quick thinking by passersby kept a grass fire from getting out of hand along a campus bikepath on campus Friday, August 9.<br>
</p>
<p>
  A bicyclist riding on the bikepath near the Farm's Life Lab reported a small grass fire Friday afternoon, and stopped at a nearby building to alert the UCSC Fire Department.<br>
</p>
<p>
  In the meantime, the Farm's garden manager, Christof Bernau, also spotted the fire, and he and other staffers grabbed garden hoses and rushed to the scene, slowing the fire considerably.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The heat wave had prompted Bernau, who usually doesn't leave work during lunch, to take a swim in the ocean during his lunch break. He discovered the fire as he was walking back to work.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "We're very fortunate the people from the Farm were here," said fire captain Don Brookes. Brookes said the fire grew to about 70 yards by 10 yards in about five minutes. Firefighters quickly extinguished the blaze. Its cause was not determined.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Fire chief Charles Hernandez said the fire served as a reminder for people to heed the "fire danger" signs posted on campus.

</h3>
<p>
  Preparation work for the new UCSC Engineering Building has prompted the closing of Lot 139, the lot behind Baskin Engineering Building. The lot is expected to remain closed, with the contractor likely to break ground on the new building this month. New handicapped spaces are available for those who require them. There are also some spaces reserved for university and service vehicles. Others should park in the Core West Parking Structure or Lot 150, which is also known as the North Perimeter Lot. Guests to the campus may use pay station spaces at the parking structure. <a href="../../construction.html">Construction update story</a>
