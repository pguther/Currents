#### Robert Fairlie

Robert Fairlie, assistant professor of economics, has received a grant from the Spencer Foundation for research on the flight of whites from public schools into private schools. Fairlie will use data from the National Educational Longitudinal Study (NELS) and a recently released confidential dataset from the National Center for Educational Statistics to explore unanswered questions related to "white flight," including

* Which whites are fleeing to private schools in response to minority schoolchildren?
* Is white flight stronger for high or low socioeconomic whites?
* What are the underlying causes of white flight?
* Is it due to racism, concerns over peer group effects, or other factors?
* Are advantaged minorities also fleeing from poor minorities?
* Are public schools with large concentrations of minority schoolchildren losing those minorities with the highest socioeconomic status and test scores to private schools?
* What impact does the phenomenon have on the racial and socioeconomic composition of students who remain in public schools?

The findings will have implications for understanding the potential effects of private school vouchers, increased public school choice, and busing on the racial and socioeconomic composition of the nation's public schools. Fairlie's grant was funded by a Spencer Foundation project that supports research on pressing educational issues.

#### Ignacio Camarillo

Postdoctoral researcher Ignacio Camarillo has received a 2000 Travel Grant Award from the Endocrine Society. He will use the $500 award to support his presentation of a research paper at the June meeting of the Endocrine Society in Toronto. Camarillo studies the role of reproductive hormones in breast cancer susceptibility in professor of biology Frank Talamantes's lab.
