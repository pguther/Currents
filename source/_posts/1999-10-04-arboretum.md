The Arboretum is holding its annual Fall Plant Sale in conjunction with the California Native Plant Society on Saturday, October 9, from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. The sale will take place at the Arboretum Eucalyptus Grove, near the intersection of Western Drive and High Street.

  
The highlight of the sale will be the Telopeas, Australian plants with crimson flowers six inches wide, which the Arboretum will be selling for the first time in many years. These spectacular plants bear the scientific name _Telopea speciosissima,_ which means "most showy, seen from afar." They are best grown in east-facing or northeast-facing areas or in areas with enough shade to keep the roots moderately cool. The plants become upright narrow shrubs, six to nine feet tall, that can be pruned severely once established.   
  
The Telopeas are very difficult to find in the United States. The [Arboretum][1] has propagated a large number for this year's sale, but there is a chance they will sell out during the members-only segment of the sale. From 10 to 11 a.m., the sale will be open only to members of the Arboretum and the California Native Plant Society (CNPS). You may join the Arboretum Associates on the day of the sale.  
  
The Arboretum is joining with CNPS for the fifth year to offer a wide selection of plants at this annual sale. In addition to the Telopeas, the Arboretum will have a good selection of the exotic Proteas for sale.  
  
For gardeners on the Central Coast, fall is an ideal time to plant California native plants or South African and Australian landscaping plants. The cooler months after the last heat wave of summer passes allow plants to establish good root systems before the next dry summer season. By establishing drought-tolerant plants from California, Australia, and South Africa now, gardeners can have plants that look good for years to come.  
  
The Arboretum specializes in plants not readily available in nurseries. Several of _Sunset_ magazine's "best of the new plants" have been selections that were created or imported by the Arboretum staff. The Fall Plant Sale is an opportunity to buy plants now that may show up later on the "best of the new plants" lists. Local nurseries often donate additional plants to the sale.   
  
The Arboretum is open daily from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. The Arboretum gift shop, Norrie's Gifts, is open Tuesdays through Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., and Sundays, 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. The Jean and Bill Lane Horticultural Library is open Wednesdays through Sundays, 1 p.m. to 4 p.m.
