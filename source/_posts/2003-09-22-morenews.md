</p>
<p>
  Brown and Wellman presented one of approximately 120 research papers commissioned for the conference, which aimed to make a "historically significant" contribution to the realms of research and national discourse on the future of racial integration.<br>

  <a name="measures" id="measures"></a>Measures of academic excellence rising under comprehensive review of UC applications
</p>
<p>
  Virtually every measure of academic excellence has grown stronger under the comprehensive review policy that has guided freshman admissions at the University of California for the past two years, according to a faculty report presented to the UC Board of Regents on September 18.<br>
</p>
<p>
  In addition, the proportions of students admitted to selective campuses from low-income families, families with no previous experience with college, low-performing schools, and rural areas are also higher than they were before comprehensive review was implemented in 2001 for the freshman class applying to enter UC in the fall of 2002.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Under comprehensive review, applications from students demonstrating high academic accomplishment are given priority, and merit is assessed in terms of academic and personal achievements, taking into consideration the opportunities available to students at their schools. No applicants are denied without a comprehensive review of their files.
