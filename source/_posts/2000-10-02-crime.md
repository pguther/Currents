  The UCSC Police Department has released its report on campus crime statistics for the 1999 year. The statistics are part of an annual report entitled, "Crime Awareness &amp; Campus Security: Student, Staff &amp; Faculty 'Right-to-Know.'"<br>
  <br>
  In addition to the crime statistics, the report contains information on the campus's policy on weapons (none are allowed without written permission from the chancellor or an equivalent authority); reporting on sexual assault, rape, or sexual harassment; tips on safety; and information about resources available to faculty, staff, and students.
