Best-selling author and syndicated political columnist Molly Ivins will be a keynote speaker at a conference for university women on March 7-8 at the Cathedral Hill Hotel in San Francisco.

Women from all universities are invited to attend the third biannual conference sponsored by UC San Francisco, "Women Leaders 2002: A Symposium for Women in University Settings." The conference is being presented by UCSF's Center for Gender Equity.

Ivins will be joined by fellow keynote speakers Bertice Berry, a sociologist, educator, author, and comedian, and Helen Zia, an award-winning journalist, author, and contributing editor to _Ms._ magazine.

In addition, a keynote panel discussion will feature Chancellor Carol Tomlinson-Keasey of UC Merced, Jacqueline Mimms, assistant vice president for school/university partnerships in educational outreach in the UC Office of the President, and Cecilia Burciaga, assistant vice president of California State University, Monterey Bay.

UC Regent Odessa Johnson will serve as the moderator.

The conference will offer opportunities for education, inspiration, and connection for all university women. Highlights include 30 workshops in three tracks: leadership, personal development, and communication. Also planned are a reception, onsite bookstore, raffles, giveaways, and a Women Artisans Galleria.

Detailed information is available on the conference [web site][1]. Advance registration until March 1 is $250 per person; onsite registration is $300 per person.
