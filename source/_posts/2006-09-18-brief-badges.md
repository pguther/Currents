<p>
  Campus police will be hosting a countywide day of stepped-up enforcement of traffic laws throughout campus on Wednesday, September 20.
</p>
<p>
  Dubbed "BADGES," for "Before Aggressive Drivers Get Everybody Stopped," the initiative will target pedestrians, drivers, and bicyclists, and include seat-belt violations, speeding, and equipment violations, such as broken or nonfunctioning brake lights. Police from neighboring jurisdictions, including the cities of Santa Cruz, Watsonville, Scotts Valley, and Capitola, as well as Santa Cruz County sheriff's deputies and the California Highway Patrol, will participate in the stepped-up enforcement on the UCSC campus. Most of the officers will patrol on motorcycles.
