NAACP president Kweisi Mfume's speech at the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Convocation on January 24 has prompted numerous inquiries about recordings and videotapes of the event.  

  
Mfume's keynote address was to be rebroadcast, edited for length, on KUSP 88.9 FM from 6 to 7 p.m. on Sunday, February 4.  
The videotape of Mfume's Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium is not available for purchase, but there are several other options for those interested in the speech.

* **Campus cable:** There will be rebroadcasts of the convocation on campus cable television, Channel 31. This channel can be viewed via any television hooked into the UCSC campus cable system, including residence hall rooms and classrooms. The rebroadcasts will air at 4 p.m. and 8 p.m., on Monday, February 12, and Friday, February 23.
* **McHenry Library:** Beginning no later than February 12, the tape will be available for on-site viewing by the campus community and the public (with library card, driver's license, or ID card). This availability to the public pertains to this video only, not all Media Center holdings. Hours of operation are Monday -Thursday, 9 a.m. to 10:30 p.m.; Friday, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.; Saturday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.; and Sunday, 10 a.m. to 10:30 p.m. Phone-in "holds" may be placed on videos, by citing the specific date and time requested and providing the call number: VT7356**.** For reservations or more information, call (831) 459-4508.
