  Enjoy fresh organic strawberry shortcake and lemonade as you listen to bluegrass music at the UCSC Farm on Wednesday, May 24.
</p>
<p>
  The fun starts at 4 p.m. and wraps up at 6 p.m. A $5 donation is requested. (The festival will be canceled if it rains.)
</p>
<p>
  Proceeds help provide limited-income shares in the Farm's Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) program. Festival sponsors include the California Strawberry Commission, Earthbound Farms, Swanton Berry Farm, Clover Stornetta Farms, and New Leaf Community Markets.
</p>
<p>
  The Campus Bake Shop will support the event, and the Community Agroecology Network will provide coffee.
