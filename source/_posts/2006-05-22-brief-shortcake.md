Enjoy fresh organic strawberry shortcake and lemonade as you listen to bluegrass music at the UCSC Farm on Wednesday, May 24.

The fun starts at 4 p.m. and wraps up at 6 p.m. A $5 donation is requested. (The festival will be canceled if it rains.)

Proceeds help provide limited-income shares in the Farm's Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) program. Festival sponsors include the California Strawberry Commission, Earthbound Farms, Swanton Berry Farm, Clover Stornetta Farms, and New Leaf Community Markets.

The Campus Bake Shop will support the event, and the Community Agroecology Network will provide coffee.
