  <span class="sectionhead"><a name="plaintiff" id="plaintiff"></a>University of California named lead plaintiff in Dynegy Securities Suit</span><br>
</p>
<p>
  The United States District Court Monday (Oct. 28) named the University of California as lead plaintiff in the Dynegy securities fraud class action lawsuit. Judge Sim Lake of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas in Houston based his 27-page ruling on a combination of factors, including the amount of losses that UC sustained as a result of its Dynegy investments, the characterization of its claims as "typical" of those of other class members, and its ability to litigate the case on behalf of the shareholders.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The University of California's Dynegy losses totaled $112.4 million, based on 4.16 million shares purchased between Nov. 1, 2000, and May 7, 2002. The current value of UC's diversified portfolio, which includes both pension and endowment funds, stands at approximately $51 billion. <a href="http://www.ucnewswire.org/news_viewer.cfm?story_PK=2158&amp;CFID=262670&amp;CFTOKEN=4479462">Full text of press release</a><br>
