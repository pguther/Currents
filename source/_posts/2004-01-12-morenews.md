  <a name="gallery" id="gallery"></a>'Organic Matter' is title of new exhibit at the Sesnon Gallery<br>
</p>
<p>
  "Organic Matter," an exhibit of works by Terri Rolland and Tracy Krumm, will be on display at the <a href="http://arts.ucsc.edu/sesnon">Mary Porter Sesnon Art Gallery</a> at Porter College January 14 through March 6.<br>
</p>
<p>
  In a series of large mixed-media landscape paintings on canvas entitled "Migrating Trees," Terri Rolland is inspired by the phenomenon in which whole forests migrate with climate changes caused by global warming. Her smaller black-and-white "Organic Cartoon" series is more figurative and features groupings of thick, black geometric forms.
</p>
<p>
  <a href="http://users.lmi.net/tkrumm/">Tracy Krumm</a>'s powerful and provocative vessel forms blend blacksmithing and crocheted nets of delicate wire lace that are often combined with found elements of metal, stone, and glass. Krumm confronts and traverses the boundaries of textiles and sculpture as she blurs the lines between conventional "male" and "female" work.
</p>
<p>
  An opening reception will be held on January 14 from 5 to 6 p.m., followed by gallery talk with the artists from 6 to 7 p.m. Regular gallery hours are Tuesday through Saturday, noon to 5 p.m.<br>

  <a name="dante" id="dante"></a>Literature professor to give Dante Society lecture
</p>
<p>
  Margaret Brose, professor of Italian and comparative literature, will give a talk to the Dante Alighieri Society of Santa Cruz on January 14 at 7:30 p.m. at the Vets Hall, 846 Front Street, in Santa Cruz. Her presentation, titled "Inferno I: The Dark and Savage Way, A reading and interpretation of Canto I of Dante's <i>Inferno,</i>" is part of a long tradition of public reading and interpretation of a single canto from Dante's <i>Divine Comedy</i>.
</p>
<p>
  Giovanni Boccaccio, the author of the <i>Decameron,</i> was hired in 1374 [the<br>
  year of his death] by the Comune of Florence to give the first public Lectura Dantis. That tradition has continued for almost 700 years, sponsored by the many Dante Societies all over the world. The Santa Cruz Society Dante Alighieri is proud to be initiating its series of Lecturae Dantis this year.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Those planning to attend should read in advance the first canto of the <i>Inferno</i> (in the bilingual edition of Robert Durling and Ronald Martinez, Oxford University Press), and should bring their copy of the text with them. The text of <i>Inferno I,</i> in Italian and English, will be made available through the Dante Society and<br>
  will be mailed upon request. Please e-mail <a href="mailto:dantesantacruz@sbcglobal.net">dantesantacruz@sbcglobal.net</a> or call (831) 423-3900 and provide your address for a free copy. The suggested donation for the lecture is $5.<br>
