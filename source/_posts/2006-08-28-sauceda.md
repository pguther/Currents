  Tom Sauceda, curator of New Zealand plants at the UCSC Arboretum, coauthored a section of a new gardening book from Timber Press, <i>Hebes: A Guide to Species, Hybrids, and Allied Genera,</i> by Lawrie Metcalf.
</p>
<p>
  The genus <i>Hebe</i> is a treasure trove of more than 100 species and subspecies of medium-sized to dwarf evergreen shrubs with outstanding ornamental features, both of flower and leaf. Native to New Zealand, these plants are grown in Australia, the western United States, the United Kingdom, and continental Europe. Many species boast handsome foliage, ranging from a rich, glittering green to gray, silver, bronze, red, and violet.
</p>
<p>
  This definitive volume provides a wealth of information about the native habitats, preferred growing conditions, cultivation, and history of hebes, and an A-Z guide to all the known species and most horticulturally valuable hybrids. For gardeners, growers, and nurseries, this is the definitive volume on these aristocrats among ornamental shrubs.
