Julie Bettie, associate professor of sociology, has received two more awards for her book, _Women Without Class: Girls, Race, and Identity_ (Berkeley: University of California Press, 2003).

![][1]The book received the Outstanding Achievement in Scholarship Award from the Race, Class, and Gender Section of the American Sociological Association (ASA), and it received the Sex and Gender Distinguished Book Award from the Sex and Gender Section of the ASA. Both awards were presented during the association's annual conference in San Francisco in August.

_Women Without Class,_ which last year received the Critics' Choice Award from the American Educational Studies Association, is based on research Bettie conducted with girls at a Central Valley high school. In the book, Bettie shows the many ways in which young women's lives are shaped by class, race, and gender.
