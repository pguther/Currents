Awards & Honors

Ocean sciences graduate student wins fellowship

Ocean sciences graduate student Yasmin Lucero has won a fellowship in population dynamics sponsored jointly by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) and the National Sea Grant College Program.

Lucero will use the $38,000 fellowship to investigate uncertainties in stock assessments, which are used to aid fisheries management, among other things. Marc Mangel, professor of environmental studies, is Lucero's academic adviser on the project. She will also be working with Alec MacCall, supervisor of the groundfish analysis team at the National Marine Fisheries Service Santa Cruz Laboratory.

Mangel and MacCall are coprincipal investigators of the Center for Stock Assessment Research (CSTAR), a joint project of the NMFS Santa Cruz Lab and UCSC. CSTAR supports research and training in the basic science associated with the problems of assessing the numerical abundance, spatial distribution, size distribution, and reproductive status of commercially important fish species.
