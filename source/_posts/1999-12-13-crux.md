The [Sesnon Gallery][1] will host a performance by San Francisco Bay-area humorist and spoken word artist, Lauren Crux. Crux's show is titled "On Being Cool and Other Digressions" and takes place in the gallery on Thursday, January 6, at 8 p.m. A reception follows.

Crux tells stories in a style one critic called, "comedy with tragic pot-holes." She talks about the beauty and horror of life: the messiness, the struggles, and the delights.   
  
In "On Being Cool and Other Digressions," Crux creates elaborate narratives that are pithy and provocative. About her performances, Crux says, "I address issues relevant to lesbians today including aging, cross-generational influence, identity (are we still lesbians anymore?), politics (around what issues do we organize?), sexuality, desire, and reciprocity."  
  
Lauren Crux has performed at Highways Performance Space and LACE in Los Angeles, as well as other San Francisco/Bay Area performance venues. Most recently, she was a featured performer for an evening of celebration honoring LGBT Pride Month produced by KQED-Radio.
