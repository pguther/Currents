  The <a href="http://arts.ucsc.edu/sesnon">Sesnon Gallery</a> will host a performance by San Francisco Bay-area humorist and spoken word artist, Lauren Crux. Crux's show is titled "On Being Cool and Other Digressions" and takes place in the gallery on Thursday, January 6, at 8 p.m. A reception follows.
</p>Crux tells stories in a style one critic called, "comedy with tragic pot-holes." She talks about the beauty and horror of life: the messiness, the struggles, and the delights.<br>
<br>
In "On Being Cool and Other Digressions," Crux creates elaborate narratives that are pithy and provocative. About her performances, Crux says, "I address issues relevant to lesbians today including aging, cross-generational influence, identity (are we still lesbians anymore?), politics (around what issues do we organize?), sexuality, desire, and reciprocity."<br>
<br>
Lauren Crux has performed at Highways Performance Space and LACE in Los Angeles, as well as other San Francisco/Bay Area performance venues. Most recently, she was a featured performer for an evening of celebration honoring LGBT Pride Month produced by KQED-Radio.<br>
