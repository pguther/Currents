Finish your holiday shopping right here on campus. Bestsellers, calendars, slug sweatshirts, and children's books will all be 20 percent off at the Bay Tree Bookstore's annual holiday open house on Wednesday, December 14, from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.

The bookstore's special one-day holiday sale is just for staff and faculty. There will be a 20 percent discount on all UCSC apparel and emblematic and seasonal gift items on the day of the open house. The sale excludes items previously marked down or on sale.

In addition, there will also be a 20 percent discount on all general books (not textbooks) from December 14 until the campus closes on December 23. Hardback books are always discounted 20 percent, but just for the sale, Harry Potter books will be 30 percent off.

The Computer Department is raffling off a new Apple Nano--the hottest gift this season--and a 15-inch combo Powerbook. And check out the great end-of-year deals on Apple Powerbooks while supplies last.

Light refreshments will be offered throughout the day.
