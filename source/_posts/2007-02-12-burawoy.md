  Sociology professor Michael Burawoy of UC Berkeley will deliver the Richard Gordon Memorial Lecture on Wednesday, February 21, at 3 p.m. in the Alumni Room of the University Center at UCSC.
</p>
<p>
  Burawoy will discuss "Social Science and Politics," and a reception will be held following the lecture. The event, sponsored by the Politics Department, is free and open to the public.
</p>
<p>
  Dubbed "sociology's underground man" by the <i>Village Voice</i>, Burawoy has studied the industrial working class "from the bottom up," spending 10 months as a machine operator in a south Chicago engine shop, working in champagne and steel factories in Hungary, and spending more than a year as a personnel officer in the Zambian copper mines.
</p>
<p>
  "My main focus has been in seeking to make little contributions to shifting sociology in a critical direction," he told the newspaper. "As a Marxist I try to bring visions from the shop floor to academia, to recover visions from below that might inform alternatives in the future."
</p>
<p>
  Through his research, Burawoy has developed methodologies that allow broad conclusions to be drawn from ethnographic research and case studies. Burawoy is coauthor, with nine graduate students, of <i>Global Ethnography</i>, which shows how globalization can be studied "from below" through participation in the lives of those who experience it.
</p>
<p>
  As a scholar, Burawoy has tried to reconstruct Marxism in light of his research and, more broadly, in the light of historical challenges of the late 20th and early 21st centuries.<br>
  <br>
  Richard Gordon was an associate professor of politics at UCSC. He died in 1996 at the age of 50. A native of Australia, he joined the faculty in 1977 and taught comparative politics and political economy. He was a preceptor and taught the core course at Stevenson College for a number of years.
