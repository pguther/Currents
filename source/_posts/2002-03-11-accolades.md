### Norman Locks

Associate professor of art Norman Locks is having an exhibition of his photographs at [Julie Baker Fine Art gallery][1] in Grass Valley, Calif. The exhibition, [_Trails and Paths between Urban and Wilderness Landscapes_,][2] will be on view through March 31.

In this series of photographs, Locks mounts together and juxtaposes wilderness and urban imagery. Dense wilderness scenes are mounted together with trucks at a roadstop, San Francisco streets, and motel parking lots. Locks's images offer a dialogue about man's relationship to his chosen environments. Many of the pieces are narrative, describing a specific journey he has taken from one landscape to another.
