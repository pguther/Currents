  <font color="#003399">Norman Locks</font>
</h3>Associate professor of art Norman Locks is having an exhibition of his photographs at <a href="http://www.juliebakerfineart.com/index.html">Julie Baker Fine Art gallery</a> in Grass Valley, Calif. The exhibition, <a href="http://www.juliebakerfineart.com/exhibitions/index.html"><i>Trails and Paths between Urban and Wilderness Landscapes</i>,</a> will be on view through March 31.
<p>
  In this series of photographs, Locks mounts together and juxtaposes wilderness and urban imagery. Dense wilderness scenes are mounted together with trucks at a roadstop, San Francisco streets, and motel parking lots. Locks's images offer a dialogue about man's relationship to his chosen environments. Many of the pieces are narrative, describing a specific journey he has taken from one landscape to another.
