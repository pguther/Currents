  The family drama <i>Ceremonies in Dark Old Men</i> will be performed by the African American Theater Arts Troupe February 20-22, one of many UCSC events marking Black History Month.
</p>
<p>
  <i>"Ceremonies in Dark Old Men</i> is a black American classic," said Don Williams, director of the Theater Arts Troupe. The play was the first he directed when he founded the troupe 13 years ago, he noted.
</p>
<p>
  Originally set in the 1960s, the UCSC performance will be set in the 1970s, but remains timely, said Williams. "This is reality. You go to any major city, and you see this lifestyle." It was written in 1965 by prolific playwright and screenwriter Lonne Elder III, who was nominated for an Oscar for his adaptation of the classic children's story <i>Sounder.</i><br>
</p>
<p>
  The drama centers on the relationship of a father, his two sons, and daughter. An injury prompts the father to set up a barbershop in the basement of his home to earn some money, and the daughter becomes the family breadwinner.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The African American Theater Arts Troupe is a student-based organization made up of artists from a variety of backgrounds and majors. Over the years, Williams said, the visibility of the program has grown and theater arts majors now dominate the cast. "This year is unique in that out of seven actors, six are theater arts majors," he said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The troupe was formed as a vehicle to create unity, higher visibility, and understanding of African American culture, encouraging the celebration of ethnic diversity and cultures at UCSC and in the larger community through both educational and creative outlets.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Through its productions and campus and community collaborations, the African American Theater Arts Troupe formed the African American Student Scholarship Fund at UCSC, giving out annual awards and providing more than $50,000 in scholarship funding since 1992.<br>
</p>
<p>
  <i>Ceremonies in Dark Old Men</i> will be performed at 8 p.m. on Friday and Saturday, February 20 and 21, and at 3 p.m. on Sunday, February 22, all at the UCSC Second Stage. General admission tickets are $11; senior citizen and student tickets are $7. Tickets are available from the UCSC Ticket Office, (831) 459-2159. Additional information on the production is available by contacting Williams at (831) 459-3409, or via <a href="mailto:Dwilliam@ucsc.edu%0D">e-mail.</a><br>
