#### It's time to renew parking permits and programs

![][1]This year Transportation and Parking Services is encouraging faculty and staff to apply online for 2001-02 parking permits or commute programs. TAPS will not be sending out paper packets, except by request. To receive your permit or programs, including bus passes, in a timely manner, TAPS requests that you submit an [online application][2] by Friday, June 22.  
  
New [permit options for 2001-02][3] include: Academic Year "A" permits, Academic Quarterly "A" permits, Academic Quarterly "A" Limited Day permits, Academic Year "R" permits, Academic Quarterly "R" permits, Quarterly Motorcycle permits and 1/2 packets of "Daily-A-Permits (scratch-off) for employees hired less than 50% time. Another parking program being offered for the first time is the Annual West Perimeter-Lot 127 permit. 250 permits will be available by lottery for Lot 127, formerly the West Remote lot. The lottery deadline is June 15, 2001. Permits for this lot are two-thirds the cost of an "A permit and are offered on an annual basis only.  
  
A new vanpool is available to Live Oak commuters with an 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. schedule. For information on this new vanpool and space availability  
for other vanpools, contact the vanpool coordinator at (831) 459-5495 or e-mail  
[cjward@cats.ucsc.edu][4]

Continuing vanpoolers, Multi-Year "A," and Multi-Year Motorcycle permit holders don't have to do anything for the upcoming 2001-02 year.

#### Staff and faculty mentors sought

The Paige and Eloise Smith Scholastic Society is bringing together UCSC alumni, faculty, and staff to serve the educational aspirations of UCSC students who are foster children, wards of the court, and orphans. There will be over 40 of these students on campus next fall. They will receive scholarships from the Paige and Eloise Smith Scholastic Society, but they will also need other help.   
  
Can you help someone through the registration process? Could you correspond occasionally via e-mail with a student needing advice about a major? Perhaps you could help a new student connect with just the right faculty member to explore his or her visions or goals. If you are interested in any level of mentorship relationship with a current student who has been a foster child, ward of the court, or orphan, please contact Lynn Zachreson in the Alumni Office at ( 831) 459-5842.
