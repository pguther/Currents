<p>
  Acting Chancellor George Blumenthal will open his office every week to UC Santa Cruz students, staff, and faculty to hear the ideas and concerns of campus community members.
</p>
<p>
  Blumenthal, whose office is in Kerr Hall, will set aside time each week for the informal sessions; office hours are open to campus constituents only.
</p>
<p>
  "I'm very interested to hear what's on the minds of students, staff, and faculty," said Blumenthal. "E-mail is great, but it's no substitute for talking with people face-to-face."
</p>
<p>
  Appointments will be available on a first-come, first-served basis. To request an appointment, please use the online request form available at <a href="http://chancellor.ucsc.edu/hours.shtml">http://chancellor.ucsc.edu/hours.shtml</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The office hours are not intended to circumvent existing campus processes for matters related to student discipline, discrimination or whistleblower complaints, interpersonal conflicts, or labor grievances or personnel matters.
