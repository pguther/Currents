Acting Chancellor George Blumenthal will open his office every week to UC Santa Cruz students, staff, and faculty to hear the ideas and concerns of campus community members.

Blumenthal, whose office is in Kerr Hall, will set aside time each week for the informal sessions; office hours are open to campus constituents only.

"I'm very interested to hear what's on the minds of students, staff, and faculty," said Blumenthal. "E-mail is great, but it's no substitute for talking with people face-to-face."

Appointments will be available on a first-come, first-served basis. To request an appointment, please use the online request form available at <http://chancellor.ucsc.edu/hours.shtml>.

The office hours are not intended to circumvent existing campus processes for matters related to student discipline, discrimination or whistleblower complaints, interpersonal conflicts, or labor grievances or personnel matters.
