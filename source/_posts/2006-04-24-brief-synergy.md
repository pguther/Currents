"Deep Down Beauty: Particle Physics, Mathematics, and the World Around Us" is the title of the Spring Synergy Lecture by Bruce Schumm, professor of physics. The talk will take place on Tuesday, May 2, at 4 p.m. in the Current Periodicals Room of the Science & Engineering Library.

Schumm is the author of _Deep Down Things: The Breathtaking Beauty of Particle Physics._ In his lecture, he will discuss the profound and surprising connection between the worlds of physics and higher mathematics, and how the latter casts light on why the universe is a worthwhile place in which to spend time.

Light refreshments will be available at the event.
