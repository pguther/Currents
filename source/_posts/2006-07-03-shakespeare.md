  The play's the thing, but Shakespeare Santa Cruz's 25th anniversary summer festival offers up more than just great performances.
</p>
<p>
  A variety of engaging new classes, museum exhibits, backstage tours, and free lectures are just some of the activities that will be available this summer to enrich the festival experience.
</p>
<p>
  New this year is a series of Shakespeare-related courses offered through UCSC's Summer Session--taught by UCSC faculty as well as by visiting SSC company members. Courses will include an introduction to Shakespeare's work, writing in response to the Bard, developing the range and expressivity of one's performance voice, Shakespearean acting, and exploring Hamlet's conundrums (in an online course offered by James Bierman). Registration is available <a href="http://summer.ucsc.edu/courselist.html">online</a>. (Click on Theater Arts for course listings).

  Beginning July 29, the Museum of Art &amp; History will also present a special retrospective exhibition celebrating the company's 25th anniversary. Titled <i>A Most Rare Vision: Shakespeare Santa Cruz, the First 25 Years,</i> the exhibit will run through November 12 at the museum's Art Forum Gallery. A companion exhibit, <i>Exits &amp; Entrances,</i> opens to the public at Santa Cruz County Bank's main branch on July 10 and continues through October 31.

  Shakespeare Santa Cruz's free Saturday morning backstage tours will continue to offer a sneak peek into the world of costuming, special effects, and the technical aspects of professional theater. Tours will be held on Saturdays from August 5 to 26 at 11 a.m. While the tours are free, advance reservations are required as space is limited. Call (831) 459-5810 to make reservations

Featured speakers will include Shakespeare scholar and Stanford professor Stephen Orgel, and UCSC professor emeritus John Dizikes with Paul Whitworth, as well as an in-depth question-and-answer section with the actors from the company. The weekend conference runs August 11-13 and will be held on campus. The cost is $25 for adults and $10 for youth. Tickets for performances are not included.
