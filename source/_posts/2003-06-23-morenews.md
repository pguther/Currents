UCSC transfer program hosts college tour  

Students from nine regional community colleges had the time of their lives during a spring bus tour of three UC campuses in Southern California.  
Eighty-nine students participated in the three-day whirlwind tour sponsored by UCSC's Transfer Partnerships Program (TPP). The group visited UC San Diego, UCLA, and UC Santa Barbara.  

TTP coordinated the second annual tour with participation from directors of numerous community college programs that serve primarily underrepresented students. Students and counselors from the following colleges participated: Skyline College, Mission College, San Jose City College, Canada College, College of San Mateo, Monterey Peninsula College, Cabrillo College, Gavilan College, and Hartnell College.  

The tour helped students explore their options and increase their understanding of the opportunities available at the different UC campuses. A student tour guide at UCSB explained what is expected of transfer students, while a panel organized by UCLA's Student Transfer Outreach Mentor Program (STOMP) gave university students a chance to share their experiences. At UCSD, tour participants heard from members of several student organizations, including the National Society of Black Engineers, the California Alliance for Minority Participation, the All Campus Transfer Association, and the Hispanic Engineers Association. _
