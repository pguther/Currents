Psychology professor Dominic Massaro has been named a 2006 Tech Laureate by the Tech Museum of Innovation in San Jose. Massaro received a Microsoft Education Award for his work with Animated Speech Corp.

Massaro was honored for his work developing facial animation software that is being used with hearing-impaired and autistic children. (See [earlier Currents story][1])

Massaro was one of 25 innovators recognized for their use of technology to benefit humanity. Recipients in more than 105 countries received awards for their work "solving the world's most pressing challenges." The awards will be presented November 15 at a gala ceremony at the Tech Museum. Microsoft founder Bill Gates will receive the 2006 James C. Morgan Global Humanitarian Award sponsored by Applied Materials, Inc., for his support of global humanitarian projects.
