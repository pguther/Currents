Gwendolyn Mink

Politics professor Gwendolyn Mink has edited a new book, _Whose Welfare?_ (Ithaca, N.Y.: Cornell University Press, 1999), a critical response to welfare reform that presents ten essays by scholar-activists, most of whom were mobilized to campaign against the 1996 federal legislation.

The collection is divided into three sections that present historical perspectives on contemporary welfare politics; the impacts of the new welfare law on women, particularly women of color and low-wage workers; and a section devoted to visions of a just welfare state that would promote the equality of women.

Among the contributors are: political scientist Frances Fox Piven, who has been active in the welfare rights movement since the mid-1960s; Mimi Abramovitz, a professor of social policy at the Hunter College School of Social Work; historian Rickie Solinger, author of _Wake Up Little Susie: Single Pregnancy and Race before_ Roe v. Wade; Dorothy Roberts, professor of law at Northwestern University and author of _Killing the Black Body: Race, Reproduction, and the Meaning of Liberty_; and Lynn Fujiwara, a recent UCSC graduate who earned her Ph.D. in sociology.
