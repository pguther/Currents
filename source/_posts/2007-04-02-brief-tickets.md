A spirit of cooperation filled the air as representatives of Santa Cruz and UCSC gathered to celebrate the debut of a joint ticketing system for campus, Civic Auditorium, and community events.

"This proves we really can make beautiful music together when we want to," said Acting Chancellor George Blumenthal at the March 28 reception in the Civic Auditorium lobby.

The new system--Santa Cruz Tickets--is a comprehensive community ticket office from which patrons can buy tickets to most local performances and events through one source, either [online][1], in person at the City's Civic Auditorium Box Office, or the UCSC Ticket Office. (See [press release][2])

Santa Cruz Mayor Emily Reilly said the idea of forming a joint ticketing operation "is one of those things that seems like a simple thing." Putting it all together was a difficult project, however, involving about 30 people, she said.

"This would not have happened without every link in the chain saying 'we can do this.' " Reilly added that special thanks should go to city staffers Shannon Toombs and Andy Botsford.

"A lot of people worked above and beyond the call of duty," Blumenthal said, recognizing UCSC staff members Luisa Cardoza and Jessi Bond in particular for their work on the project.
