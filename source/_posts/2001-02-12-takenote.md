First Night Community Quilt on display February 24 and 25

One of the activities that made this year's First Night celebration a success was the Community Quilt project, designed by quilt artist and UCSC staff member Pele Fleming. Working at tables just off Pacific Avenue, participants of all ages took house-shaped quilt pieces and created statements about their concept of home with paint, fabric, beads, and glitter. The "houses" were then tied together on the fence next to the work tables. The project was sponsored by the William James Association. A permanent location for the completed quilt has yet to be found, according to Fleming, but it will be on display at the Pajaro Valley Quilt Association's annual quilt show February 24 and 25 at the Watsonville Fairgrounds. Hours are 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Saturday and 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. on Sunday.

#### Change in procedures for Interlibrary Loan

The University Library is changing procedures for borrowing from UC Berkeley and the Northern Regional Library Facility (NRLF). All loans from UCB and NRLF will be handled through the Interlibrary Loan office the same way books are borrowed from the other UC campuses. To complete the transition, the UCSC Library needs currently loaned materials to be returned by March 2001. These are books with a "blue strap" attached to the front binding. Materials with the "yellow strap" (loaned under other ILL systems) are not affected. For more information, contact Deborah Turner, head of access services, at (831) 459-5114.
