_Incognegro_, the first book of poetry by history of consciousness associate professor David Marriott, was published on July 12 by Salt Publishing Ltd. The official launch of the book took place at The Gallery at Foyles Bookshop last week in London.

_Incognegro_ is a collection of poems and prose drawn from journals and chapbooks, plus previously unpublished pieces, centered around the black European and American literary/historical experience.

Marriott has written many articles on poetics and is the author of _On Black Men_ (2000, University Presses of Edinburgh, and Columbia, New York) and _Haunted Life: Visual Culture and Black Modernity_ (2006, Rutgers University Press). He is also coeditor (with Vicky Lebeau) of _Psychoanalysis and Poetics_ (1998, Fragmente).

Marriott was born in Nottingham and educated at the University of Sussex. He joined the UCSC faculty in 2003.
