  <i>Incognegro</i>, the first book of poetry by history of consciousness associate professor David Marriott, was published on July 12 by Salt Publishing Ltd. The official launch of the book took place at The Gallery at Foyles Bookshop last week in London.

  <i>Incognegro</i> is a collection of poems and prose drawn from journals and chapbooks, plus previously unpublished pieces, centered around the black European and American literary/historical experience.

  Marriott has written many articles on poetics and is the author of <i>On Black Men</i> (2000, University Presses of Edinburgh, and Columbia, New York) and <i>Haunted Life: Visual Culture and Black Modernity</i> (2006, Rutgers University Press). He is also coeditor (with Vicky Lebeau) of <i>Psychoanalysis and Poetics</i> (1998, Fragmente).

  Marriott was born in Nottingham and educated at the University of Sussex. He joined the UCSC faculty in 2003.
