<p>
  UCSC has been named one of the "Top 25 Colleges for Latinos" by <a href="http://www.hispaniconline.com/magazine/"><i>Hispanic Magazine</i></a> in its March 2005 issue.
</p>
<p>
  "Natural beauty, academic freedom and accessible professors draw students to the UCSC," the magazine article said. "Students have the opportunity to create documentaries on 9/11 as assignments, to coauthor research with professors, and to sign up for classes, such as Muppet Magic, about the history of Jim Henson and the Muppets."
</p>
<p>
  UCSC was ranked number 23 in the magazine's annual list. The ranking is based on the number of academic degrees awarded to Hispanics, and academic quality as rated by U.S. News &amp; World Report' s annual edition of America's Best Colleges. Colleges listed also needed to have a Hispanic enrollment of at least seven percent.
