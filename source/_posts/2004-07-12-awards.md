Awards and Honors

UCSC Fleet Services cited for environmental efforts  

Efforts to create a more environmentally friendly vehicle repair shop have earned UCSC's Fleet Services Garage certification in the Model Pollution Prevention Shop Program.   

John Ison of the California Environmental Protection Agency presented the certificate to UCSC on June 24. The Model Shop program is a project of the California Department of Toxic Substance Control.   

Obtaining the level of Model Shop indicates that the facility has the proper controls in place to protect the environment as well as workers. Use of harsh chemicals is minimized: vehicle parts are washed with hot water or biodegradable chemicals instead of petroleum-based solvents.  

Other aspects of UCSC's pollution control efforts involve the use of biodiesel fuels in all diesel-powered vehicle, and the use of electric vehicles.
