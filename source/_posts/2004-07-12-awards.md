</p>
<p>
  Efforts to create a more environmentally friendly vehicle repair shop have earned UCSC's Fleet Services Garage certification in the Model Pollution Prevention Shop Program.<br>
</p>
<p>
  John Ison of the California Environmental Protection Agency presented the certificate to UCSC on June 24. The Model Shop program is a project of the California Department of Toxic Substance Control.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Obtaining the level of Model Shop indicates that the facility has the proper controls in place to protect the environment as well as workers. Use of harsh chemicals is minimized: vehicle parts are washed with hot water or biodegradable chemicals instead of petroleum-based solvents.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Other aspects of UCSC's pollution control efforts involve the use of biodiesel fuels in all diesel-powered vehicle, and the use of electric vehicles.
