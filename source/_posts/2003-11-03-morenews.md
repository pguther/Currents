UCSC and City of Santa Cruz plan 'green' partnership

The City of Santa Cruz and UC Santa Cruz are planning a new partnership to make a greener community. By combining the ideas and energies of the university with the planning and representative powers of the city, the Green Enterprise Initiative hopes to find new strategic opportunities for sustainable business in the Santa Cruz area.  

A first outcome of this partnership is a talk by David Wallace on Friday November 7, at the Museum of Art and History. Wallace, an adviser to the UN Industrial Development Organization and to the Chinese government, will speak on the topic "Sustainable Industrialization: How the Third World and Technological Innovation Can Help Overcome Global Environmental Challenges."  
  
Wallace's ideas are counterintuitive. He thinks we should look for the emergence of an effective response to the global environmental challenge in the activism of Third World green movements, the regulatory responses of their governments, and, most surprisingly, in the co-option, from multinational corporations, of technological innovation and management expertise. Wallace's ideas are set out in his book_ [Sustainable Industrialization,][8]_ published by Earthscan, the Brookings Institution, and the Royal Institute of International Affairs.  

This event is free and open to the public. For more information, contact Ben Crow at [bencrow@ucsc.edu][9]
