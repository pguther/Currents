Spring is the season for finding out more about other cultures at UCSC. The cultures of Africa and the Philippines were showcased on the weekend of April 20-21, with African Appreciation Day and the Pilipino Cultural Celebration.

Coming up on Saturday, May 4, the diversity of cultures represented at UCSC will come together for the 23rd annual Multicultural Festival, held from noon to 6 p.m. at the Oakes College lower field.

"One World, One Rhythm" is the theme of the festival, expected to draw about 4,000 people. Music and dance are among the festival highlights. Grammy-nominee Mystic, East L.A. Sabor Factory, and folkloric and hip-hop dancers will be performing.   
  
Food booths serving a variety of traditional ethnic cuisines are a popular part of the festival. Offerings this year will include Korean bulgogee (barbecue), samosas, and halo halo ice, among many other treats.   
  
Twenty-one ethnic student organizations work with the Student Organization Advising and Resources Office to plan the free event. Alcohol is not permitted. Call (831) 459-2934 for more information.
