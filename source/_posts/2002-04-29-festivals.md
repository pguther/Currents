  Spring is the season for finding out more about other cultures at UCSC. The cultures of Africa and the Philippines were showcased on the weekend of April 20-21, with African Appreciation Day and the Pilipino Cultural Celebration.
</p>Coming up on Saturday, May 4, the diversity of cultures represented at UCSC will come together for the 23rd annual Multicultural Festival, held from noon to 6 p.m. at the Oakes College lower field.
<p>
  "One World, One Rhythm" is the theme of the festival, expected to draw about 4,000 people. Music and dance are among the festival highlights. Grammy-nominee Mystic, East L.A. Sabor Factory, and folkloric and hip-hop dancers will be performing.<br>
  <br>
  Food booths serving a variety of traditional ethnic cuisines are a popular part of the festival. Offerings this year will include Korean bulgogee (barbecue), samosas, and halo halo ice, among many other treats.<br>
  <br>
  Twenty-one ethnic student organizations work with the Student Organization Advising and Resources Office to plan the free event. Alcohol is not permitted. Call (831) 459-2934 for more information.<br>
