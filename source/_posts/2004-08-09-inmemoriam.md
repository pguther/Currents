In Memoriam

Larry Stockmeyer

Larry Stockmeyer, a research associate in computer science who came to UCSC in October 2002 following a distinguished career with the computer science principles and methodologies department at IBM Almaden Research Center, died on July 31 of pancreatic cancer.  
  
Stockmeyer, 55, was a theoretical computer scientist and a founder of the field of complexity theory, that part of computer science exploring the inherent difficulty of solving computational problems.  

Born in Evansville, Indiana, in 1948, Stockmeyer was educated at MIT, where he received a bachelor's of science in mathematics and a master's of science in electrical engineering in 1972, followed by a doctorate in computer science in 1974. Stockmeyer is well known for his groundbreaking work proving the extreme difficulty of solving naturally occurring computational problems. His pioneering contributions were soon incorporated into textbooks on computational complexity.  

Stockmeyer joined IBM Research in 1974, working first at the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center in Yorktown Heights, New York. A founding member of the Theory Group at the IBM Almaden Research Center in the early 1980s, Stockmeyer was elevated to Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery in 1996. He remained at Almaden until he took a bridge to retirement from IBM in November 2002.

Jeanne Gray

Jeanne Gray, former director of student business services at UCSC, died July 25 after a steady decline in her health due to complications from diabetes.  

Gray came to UCSC from Atlanta in 1987, where she had been manager of student loans and collections for Emory University. She retired in 1998 and moved to Arkansas. Gray was highly respected and liked by her staff and coworkers, who recall that her Southern charm helped her win over more than one difficult challenge.  

Her passion away from work was the Literacy Program, and she spent many hours reading to children and encouraging them to become avid readers.  

A memorial service was scheduled for noon, August 7, in Ozark, Arkansas. Contributions in her memory may be made to the American Diabetes Association, P.O. Box 1131, Fairfax, VA 22038-113. Checks should be made payable to the American Diabetes Association. Donors must include Gray's name, as well as the name and address of the donor and the person to be notified of the gift. Any other names to appear on the donor card should also be listed. Communications to the family can be made via e-mail to: [trusted@rgray.mailshell.com][1]  
  

Daniel MacMillen

  
Daniel MacMillen, a senior custodian with Physical Plant, died unexpectedly on July 19; he was 53. MacMillen, who had had many medical problems in recent years, had worked at UCSC since 1994.  

With his typical self-deprecating humor, MacMillen almost always introduced himself as "Big Mac." That or "Mac" was the name by which he was usually known.

Most of MacMillen's service at UCSC was in Theater Arts. He was sweet-natured and supportive, and had many interests. An aspiring writer, MacMillen wrote detective novels for years. He also loved antiques, artifacts, and curios and was a dedicated Goodwill and thrift-store shopper, always looking for those special items.

MacMillen's finds went on display in his ornately decorated apartment, and he also spent years creating a wall collage in one of the Theater Arts mechanical rooms. Around holidays he liked to cook and prepare gift baskets for people in his apartment building.

Plans for a campus memorial have not yet been finalized.
