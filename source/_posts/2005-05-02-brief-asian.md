Asian American/Pacific Islander Heritage Month gets under way May 4 with a performance by Jeremy Bautista, hip-hop/jazz musician and member of the poetry group 8th Wonder, from 6 to 8 p.m. at the Colleges Nine/Ten Multipurpose Room. A $5 donation at the door will be requested, with funds going to tsunami relief.

"Shift the Seen: Reconstructing Self-Representation" is the theme of the monthlong celebration, which "challenges stereotypes and will be a catalyst in broadening perspectives by exposing AA/PI identities through art, music, film, and dialogue," according to organizers.

Additional information will be posted online at <http://www2.ucsc.edu/aapirc/>
