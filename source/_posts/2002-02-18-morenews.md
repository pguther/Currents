</h3>
<p>
  Adrienne Walker Hoard will present a photography exhibition and talk on "Women Warriors, Artists of the Ndebele: Cultural Transformation in South African Society." Her lecture, which is free and open to the public, will be at 7:30 p.m. on Tuesday, February 19, in Oakes College, Room 106. The accompanying photographs will be on display in the Oakes Guzman Room on Tuesday, February 19, and Wednesday, February 20.<br>

  Hoard, a professor of visual arts and art history at the University of Missouri-Columbia, spent four years traveling in the provinces of South Africa after the fall of apartheid. Her photographs depict the women, men, children, and architecture of the Ndebele nation. Some of the images reflect areas in which modernization and "westernization" have had an influence on the aesthetic, social, and political choices facing the Ndebele.<a href="#Sweet"><i><br>
