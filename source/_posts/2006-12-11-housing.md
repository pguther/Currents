  UCSC will provide housing for Cabrillo College students under an agreement signed by Acting Chancellor George Blumenthal and Cabrillo College President Brian King.
</p>
<p>
  Blumenthal attended the December 4 meeting of the Cabrillo College Board of Trustees and addressed the trustees before they approved a memorandum of understanding on housing for Cabrillo students and guest educators.
</p>
<p>
  Blumenthal praised the agreement as an example of the kind of cooperative arrangements UCSC can create with local agencies that provide benefits to both parties. "UCSC and Cabrillo have enjoyed a close and productive academic partnership, and this agreement extends that working relationship into a new area," he said.
</p>
<p>
  Housing will be provided at UCSC's University Inn and Conference Center, at 611 Ocean Street in downtown Santa Cruz. The number of rooms provided for Cabrillo use will be based upon availability at the start of each Cabrillo term. The program begins in February 2007 with the start of Cabrillo's spring semester.
</p>
<p>
  "Our collaboration with UCSC has been very rewarding," declared Manuel Osorio, vice president of student services at Cabrillo. "Our students can now have convenient, quality housing at an affordable price thanks to UCSC. This is so important since students are more successful when they are able to focus on their studies without anxiety over their basic needs."
</p>
<p>
  More than 70 percent of Cabrillo's 14,000 students attend part time. For just $1,290 per month a Cabrillo student living at the UCSC University Inn and Conference Center may have a one-bedroom apartment, a seven-day meal plan, biweekly housekeeping, cable TV, laundry facilities and access to a pool, hot tub, and fitness center. Other possible options exist at the Inn, including the least-expensive alternative of double occupancy and a 75-meal-per-quarter plan, for a total of $993 per month. These rates are the same that UCSC currently charges its own students living at the UCSC Inn. Housing rates are set each academic year.
</p>
<p>
  "The special partnership between UCSC and Cabrillo is something that benefits both colleges and the community at large," said Ashish Sahni, assistant chancellor and chief of staff at UCSC. "Cabrillo sends more transfer students to UCSC than any other community college in California, which shows the strength of our collaboration and commitment to continue to work together."
</p>
<p>
  "The heart of the MOU," Assistant Chancellor Sahni added, "is it will encourage the best students at Cabrillo to explore UCSC, giving these students a running start on being part of a four-year college and benefiting from an array of academic enrichment services already offered to UCSC students."
</p>
<p>
  To be eligible, a Cabrillo student must be enrolled at least half time and be in both financial and judicial "good standing." Applications and further information on housing are available through Cabrillo's Student Affairs Office in Building 900 as well as on the <a href="http://www.cabrillo.edu/">Cabrillo College web site</a>.
