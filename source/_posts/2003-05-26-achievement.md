Student research, writing, artwork, and performances will be on display both on and off campus during Student Achievement Week, from May 31 to June 6.

The Undergraduate Research Poster Symposium May 29 will kick off the student recognition effort early by showcasing projects by students in the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences and the Jack Baskin School of Engineering.

Later in the week, capping a varied schedule, the Student Achievement Award ceremony will be held from 3 to 5 p.m. June 6 at the University Center.
