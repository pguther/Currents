#### Anthropologist Susan Harding to appear at Capitola Book Cafe

Cultural anthropologist Susan Harding will discuss her book [_The Book of Jerry Falwell: Fundamentalist Language and Politics_][1] at the [Capitola Book Cafe][2] on Wednesday, October 18, at 7:30 p.m. In this book, Harding examines Christian fundamentalism, focusing on the Reverend Jerry Falwell and his co-pastors, and, in particular, their use of the Bible's language. She argues that this language is the medium through which born-again Christians, individual and collective, come to understand themselves as Christians. According to one reviewer, the book "challenges conventional wisdom about the Christian right and makes the world of fundamentalist believers available to the rest of us." The Capitola Book Cafe is located at 1475 41st Avenue; for more information, call (831) 462-4415.
