Martha Mendoza, a 1988 graduate of UCSC (Kresge College) who received a Pulitzer Prize for investigative journalism this spring, was honored at a June 6 reception at University House. Mendoza was part of an Associated Press team that documented the killing of hundreds of civilians by U.S. troops during the early weeks of the Korean War. (See [earlier story][1].)
