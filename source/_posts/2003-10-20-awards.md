  UCSC fleet ranked among best in use of alternative fuels
</p>
<p>
  UCSC made the list of the "Top 100 Fleets" in the United States for its commitment to using alternative fuels. The list was published in the September 2003 issue of <i><a href="magazine">Automotive Fleet</a></i> magazine.
</p>
<p>
  Four UC campuses made the list: UCLA, UCR, UCSC and UCD. While other universities and state agencies combined assets to make the list, the UC campuses competed separately, according to Wes Scott, director of Transportation and Parking Services.
</p>
<p>
  Although UCSC was no. 99 on the list, the campus can expect to move up in the rankings when a compressed natural gas (CNG) fueling station is built later this year and more CNG vehicles are added to the fleet.
