Awards and Honors

Professor appointed to editorial board of _Art Journal_  

History of art and visual culture professor Catherine Soussloff has been appointed to the editorial board of [_Art Journal][1],_ a publication of the College Art Association of America. The journal, which features submissions from authors and artists worldwide, provides a forum for scholarship and exploration in the visual arts field.

UCSC fleet ranked among best in use of alternative fuels

UCSC made the list of the "Top 100 Fleets" in the United States for its commitment to using alternative fuels. The list was published in the September 2003 issue of [_Automotive Fleet][2] _magazine.

Four UC campuses made the list: UCLA, UCR, UCSC and UCD. While other universities and state agencies combined assets to make the list, the UC campuses competed separately, according to Wes Scott, director of Transportation and Parking Services.

Although UCSC was no. 99 on the list, the campus can expect to move up in the rankings when a compressed natural gas (CNG) fueling station is built later this year and more CNG vehicles are added to the fleet.
