Colleges and University Housing Services has a new program aimed at making it convenient and easy for staff and faculty to eat at UCSC. With this program, faculty and staff may purchase a Dining Passport card, which allows them to use Flexi Dollars at all UCSC coffee shops, coffee kiosks, cafes, and restaurants, including the University Center Restaurant and Joe's Pizza. With Flexi Dollars, there's a 10 percent discount at all UCSC dining halls.

![][1]As an enticement, right now if you open a $50 account or add $50 to an existing account, you get a free meal on the spot.

Flexi Dollars may be purchased at any of the five dining halls on campus or at the Campus Housing Office at 104 Hahn Student Services. Flexi Dollars are refundable.
