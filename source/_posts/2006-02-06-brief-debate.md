Both sides of the issue of military recruitment will be aired at a debate at 7 p.m. on Wednesday, February 8, at the College Nine/College Ten Multipurpose Room.

Speaking in favor of recruiting will be Army Captain William Griffin, a combat veteran and the commander of Army recruiting in the Monterey Bay region.

Taking the opposite side will be Mario Hardy Ramirez, who has been active in "counter-recruitment" efforts. He founded the Central Committee for Conscientious Objectors' Third World Outreach Program.

The debate is sponsored by College Nine and College Ten. For additional information, call (831) 459-1253.
