  Speaking in favor of recruiting will be Army Captain William Griffin, a combat veteran and the commander of Army recruiting in the Monterey Bay region.

  Taking the opposite side will be Mario Hardy Ramirez, who has been active in "counter-recruitment" efforts. He founded the Central Committee for Conscientious Objectors' Third World Outreach Program.
