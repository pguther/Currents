Kitty Klaidman The Past Purged: Hidden Memories of the Holocaust

UCSC Porter College Hall Gallery  
Through February 27  
Exhibition Hours: Monday through Friday: 10 a.m.-1 p.m. and 4 p.m.-7 p.m.   
  
Kitty Klaidman has been exhibiting her work since the mid-1960s in New York, London, Paris, Los Angeles, Washington, and other cities in Europe and the U.S. She currently has work in a traveling exhibition called "Witness and Legacy," which is touring museums throughout the country. Much of her work has been concerned with depicting physical fragments that prod us to remember the best and the worst of our history and culture. The UCSC exhibit draws on Klaidman's own history as a child in wartime Czechoslovakia, when she and her family were forced to hide in a dark, confined space for a year, but from which they emerged alive thanks to courageous Slovak farmers who hid them at the risk of their own lives. A later group of paintings in this exhibition commemorates the American dead at Normandy.

Artwork ranges from installation and performance to traditional mediums such as printmaking, painting, and photography. The interpretations on the theme of love vary from personal relationships to the love of creating art itself. The students come from a variety of academic disciplines and years of study with two things in common: their connection to Judaism and their love for art.
