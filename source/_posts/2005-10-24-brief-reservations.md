Those planning to attend Chancellor Denice Denton's investiture November 4 and the academic symposium November 3-4, "Achieving Excellence Through Diversity," are being asked to register online.

The weekend's Scholarship Benefits Dinner, an annual event that raises badly needed funds for undergraduate and graduate students, is already sold out.

Tickets to the investiture are available on a first-come, first-served basis. Guests will be seated first in the Music Recital Hall (main venue) and next in the Media Theater (simulcast venue).

The symposium will feature Shirley Ann Jackson, president of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, leading a discussion on the best practices in diversity, access, and inclusion. It will be at 2:30 p.m. on Thursday, November 3, at the Media Theater, and continue at 8:30 a.m. on Friday at the University Center's Bhojwani Room.

To register online for any or all of these events, please go to: [celebration2005.ucsc.edu/registration.asp][1].

Additional information on the investiture, symposium, and related events is available [online.][2]
