  Those planning to attend Chancellor Denice Denton's investiture November 4 and the academic symposium November 3-4, "Achieving Excellence Through Diversity," are being asked to register online.
</p>
<p>
  The weekend's Scholarship Benefits Dinner, an annual event that raises badly needed funds for undergraduate and graduate students, is already sold out.
</p>
<p>
  Tickets to the investiture are available on a first-come, first-served basis. Guests will be seated first in the Music Recital Hall (main venue) and next in the Media Theater (simulcast venue).
</p>
<p>
  The symposium will feature Shirley Ann Jackson, president of Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, leading a discussion on the best practices in diversity, access, and inclusion. It will be at 2:30 p.m. on Thursday, November 3, at the Media Theater, and continue at 8:30 a.m. on Friday at the University Center's Bhojwani Room.
