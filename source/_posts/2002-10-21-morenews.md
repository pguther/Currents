New Administrative Responsibilities Handbook now available

The Campus Controller's Office has prepared a new [Administrative Responsibilities Handbook][6]. The handbook provides a concise reference for anyone on campus with administrative responsibilities, which can range from complying with sponsored research administrative requirements to having the authority to approve the acquisition of goods and services. It is not meant to be a detailed compendium of procedures, but rather it serves as a guide to where additional assistance and guidance in addressing administrative matters can be obtained.  

The handbook is modeled after a similar handbook produced by the UC San Diego campus and has been in development for more than two years. Assistant Controller Vicki Gutzwiller played a key role in coordinating this effort.

The handbook is being distributed to all individuals on the campus with administrative management responsibilities. For more information, call Vicki Gutzwiller at (831) 459-3206.
