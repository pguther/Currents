In his new book, _Excursion for Miracles: Paul Sanasardo, Donya Feuer, and Studio for Dance,_ theater arts professor Mark Franko reexamines the overlooked early choreographic achievements of Sanasardo and Feuer, whose Studio for Dance in New York City was a bastion of early postmodern dance in the 1950s and a precursor for the radical changes in art and thought of the 1960s.

A dancer with the company for five years (1964-1969), Franko delivers a firsthand account of his experiences, combining personal anecdotes with an extensive knowledge of ethnography, critical theory, and dance history. His perspective contains both a dance scholar's theoretical expertise and the visceral recollections of a dancer emotionally connected to a body of work. Seventy-five black-and-white photographs accompany the text.

Franko has presented his work internationally since 1985 with his company NovAntiqua. He is also the author of _The Work of Dance: Labor, Movement, and Identity in the 1930s, Dancing Modernism/Performing Politics, Dance as Text: Ideologies of the Baroque Body, The Dancing Body in Renaissance Choreography,_ and coeditor of _Acting on the Past: Historical Performance Across the Disciplines_.
