Hundreds of UCSC students will be honored for their outstanding research and academic achievement during the campus's annual Student Achievement Week, which takes place May 27 through June 1.

"UCSC is known for having a faculty committed to working with undergraduates," said Lynda Goff, vice provost and dean of undergraduate education and a professor of biology.

"But we are also able to offer our students the resources and experiences of a major research university. It's a unique combination, and the evidence of our success can be seen throughout Student Achievement Week in the many events demonstrating the exceptional work of our students."

A preview event is the Linguistics and Language Studies Annual Undergraduate Conference, which takes place Friday, May 24, at the Cowell College Conference Room from 3:30 to 5:50 p.m. Call (831) 459-4988 for more information.
