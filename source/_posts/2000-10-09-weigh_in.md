This week we're launching a new feature: **Weigh In and Win!.**  
  
**Tell us what you think:** Each week, you will have the chance to give your opinion on a topic in the news, of general interest, or something just for fun. You may respond with simply a "yes," "no," or "unsure." Or you may elaborate on your response. The following week, the tally of yes's, no's, and unsures will be provided, along with a sampling of the narrative responses. Responses will appear without author names.

**Win a handsome Currents coffee mug:** Five names will be drawn at random each week from all the respondents to win a mug. In order to receive a mug, participants must be UCSC staff, faculty, or students, and they must submit their name and campus e-mail address on the response form. Only one mug per person, please. Winners' names will be listed the following week.

### This week's topic: Should it be illegal to use a cell phone while driving?
