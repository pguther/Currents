  The UCSC Music Department will explore the widely diverse world of contemporary music this month with the annual April in Santa Cruz Festival of Contemporary Music to be held in the Music Center Recital Hall.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Festival director David Evan Jones, professor of music at UCSC, has invited artists from the Bay Area and beyond who will perform music from the old guard of new music--with works by Stockhausen, Cage, and Harrison--as well as cutting-edge new works by living composers.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The festival features four concerts showcasing works by distinguished American and international composers, including members of the faculty of the UCSC Music Department (David Evan Jones, Ben Carson, Jacques Desjardins, Paul Nauert, Hi Kyung Kim, David Cope, and Peter Elsea). This year's festival will feature the premiere of <i>Ocean/Shore 2,</i> a commissioned work by Korean composer Hyo-shin Na.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Among the myriad artists performing in the monthlong festival are student musicians in UCSC's dynamic Percussion Ensemble, directed by acclaimed Bay Area teacher and musician William Winant; UCSC assistant professor of music Ben Carson; Santa Cruz's New Music Works Ensemble (featuring special appearances by choreographer and performer Tandy Beal and the work of internationally known nature photographer Kennan Ward); the San Francisco-based ensemble Earplay; internationally recognized pianist Teresa McCollough; Atlanta-based percussionist Peggy Benkeser; and percussionist Thomas Burritt of the University of Texas at Austin.<br>
