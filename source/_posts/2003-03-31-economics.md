<p>
  The financial crisis in Argentina has forced experts to reexamine the economic policies of the past decade in an effort to discover "what went wrong" in Latin America.
</p>
<p>
  On April 11-12, UCSC will host a two-day conference that will bring together many of the top behind-the-scenes economic advisers who have helped shape economic policies in Latin America for two decades.
</p>
<p>
  The conference will be a valuable chapter in the ongoing discussion of what the international financial community can learn from the crisis.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Participants include several widely quoted experts and reflect a range of views, including panelists who will discuss the social impact of financial instability in Latin America.
</p>
<p>
  Among the conference participants are:<br>
</p>
<p>
  * Sebastian Edwards, professor of international business economics at UCLA and former World Bank chief economist for Latin America and the Caribbean.<br>
</p>
<p>
  * Barry Eichengreen, professor of economics and political science at UC Berkeley and former senior policy adviser to the International Monetary Fund.<br>
</p>
<p>
  * Ricardo Hausmann, professor of the practice of economic development at Harvard University and former chief economist of the Inter-American Development Bank.<br>
</p>
<p>
  * Klaus Schmidt-Hebbel, research director of the Central Bank of Chile who spent 10 years as a senior economist with the World Bank.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The conference is being sponsored by the Institute on Global Conflict and Cooperation at UC San Diego, the Santa Cruz Center for International Economics at UCSC, Deutsche Bank, and the <i>Journal of International Money and Finance.</i>
