The financial crisis in Argentina has forced experts to reexamine the economic policies of the past decade in an effort to discover "what went wrong" in Latin America.

On April 11-12, UCSC will host a two-day conference that will bring together many of the top behind-the-scenes economic advisers who have helped shape economic policies in Latin America for two decades.

The conference will be a valuable chapter in the ongoing discussion of what the international financial community can learn from the crisis.  

Participants include several widely quoted experts and reflect a range of views, including panelists who will discuss the social impact of financial instability in Latin America.

Among the conference participants are:  

* Sebastian Edwards, professor of international business economics at UCLA and former World Bank chief economist for Latin America and the Caribbean.  
* Barry Eichengreen, professor of economics and political science at UC Berkeley and former senior policy adviser to the International Monetary Fund.   
* Ricardo Hausmann, professor of the practice of economic development at Harvard University and former chief economist of the Inter-American Development Bank.  
* Klaus Schmidt-Hebbel, research director of the Central Bank of Chile who spent 10 years as a senior economist with the World Bank.  

The conference is being sponsored by the Institute on Global Conflict and Cooperation at UC San Diego, the Santa Cruz Center for International Economics at UCSC, Deutsche Bank, and the _Journal of International Money and Finance._
