<p>
  UCSC's Safety &amp; Wellness Day event is scheduled for Thursday, October 14, at the Stevenson Event Center and the surrounding area. The goal of this day is to promote greater awareness of safety and wellness on campus.
</p>
<p>
  There'll be mini-workshops and classes on office safety, self-defense, stress management, back care, emergency preparedness, tai chi, and yoga, to name a few. A complete list of classes can be found at <a href="http://bas.ucsc.edu/events/">bas.ucsc.edu/events</a>. Classes will be presented from 10 a.m. to 3:30 p.m., with an informational fair from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. The day includes music, food, and a raffle.
</p>
<p>
  Supervisors are encouraged to provide their staff up to two hours of release time to attend the training classes and informational fair, as workloads and staffing levels permit.
</p>
<p>
  The schedule of events and enrollment information are available online at <a href="http://bas.ucsc.edu/events/">bas.ucsc.edu/events</a>. Classes are expected to fill rapidly, so registration is advised.
