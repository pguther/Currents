  You can enjoy a good meal and support Shakespeare Santa Cruz by having dinner at the Shadowbrook Restaurant on Tuesday, January 17. That's the Shadowbrook's annual Shakespeare Santa Cruz night, when the restaurant donates 30 percent of the evening's proceeds to the theater company <i>USA Today</i> called "One of the ten most influential Shakespeare Festivals in the U.S."

  For reservations, call (831) 475-1511 and mention that you are dining with Shakespeare Santa Cruz.
