The Science Matters Book Club, which meets each month during the school year at the Central Branch of the Santa Cruz Public Library, 225 Church Street, holds its next meeting on Sunday, September 24, from 2 to 4

p.m.

Science journalist Robert Irion will lead a discussion of _One Universe: At Home in the Cosmos,_ a book Irion coauthored with Neil de Grasse Tyson, the director of the Hayden Planetarium in New York, and Charles Liu, an astrophysicist at the American Museum of Natural History.  
  
The book club is open to the general public and focuses on nontechnical science books. Each discussion is led by a member of the local scientific community with expertise in the subject of that month's book. Meetings are usually on the third Sunday of each month.  
  
This month's meeting features a beautifully illustrated book that takes readers on an enjoyable and informative tour of the cosmos. A _New York Times_ review described it as "an insightful primer on all things great and small," and noted the "mind-blowing revelations" in store for readers.   
  
Irion is a freelance science writer who lives in Santa Cruz. He is a contributing editor at _Astronomy_ magazine and a contributing correspondent to _Science_ magazine. He previously worked on campus as a science writer in the Public Information Office. Irion earned a B.S. in earth and planetary science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and studied science communication at UC Santa Cruz, where he now teaches science writing.   
  
The book club is sponsored by the Santa Cruz Public Libraries, the UC Santa Cruz Science Library, the Cabrillo College Library, the Association for Women in Science--Monterey Bay, the Capitola Book Cafe, and the Santa Cruz City Museum of Natural History. The Capitola Book Cafe offers a 10 percent discount to members of the book club for the monthly selections.
