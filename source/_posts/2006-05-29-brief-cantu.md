The campus community is invited to attend the fourth annual Lionel Cantu Memorial Colloquium at 3:30 p.m. on Monday, June 5, at the Baobab Lounge at Merrill College. The event will be followed by a reception at the Lionel Cantu GLBTI Resource Center at 5:30 p.m.

This year's featured guest is Eithne Luibheid, associate professor of women's studies and director of the Committee on LGBT Studies at the University of Arizona. Luibheid is the author of _Entry Denied: Controlling Sexuality at the Border _and coeditor of _Queer Migrations: Sexuality, U.S. Citizenship, and Border Crossings._

The colloquium honors the memory of Cantu, an assistant professor of sociology who died unexpectedly in 2002. The Lionel Cantu Memorial Award Fund was established at UCSC to support a campus graduate student who is pursuing studies in one or more of the areas in which Cantu worked: immigration studies, transnational/cross-border studies, Latino/Latina sociology, gender and sexuality, or gay men and masculinity. This year's recipient of the $500 award will be announced at the colloquium. The 2006 selection committee comprises UCSC faculty members from sociology, Latin American and Latino studies, and the Chicano/Latino Research Center (CLRC).

In addition, the gathering will recognize the accomplishments of graduating seniors in sociology, including recipients of this year's Dean's and Chancellor's Undergraduate Awards.

Colloquium cosponsors include: CLRC; the Critical Race Studies Cluster; El Centro: Chicano/Latino Resource Center; Feminist Studies Department; Frank Talamantes, professor emeritus of molecular, cell, and developmental biology and former dean of Graduate Studies; Latin American and Latino Studies Department; Lionel Cantu GLBTI Resource Center; Queer Latina Network; Queer Theory Cluster; Producing the Nation Cluster; Research Cluster for the Study of Women of Color in Collaboration and Conflict; Sexuality Studies Working Group; Sociology Department; Sociology Graduate Students of Color Caucus; and the UCSC Women's Center.
