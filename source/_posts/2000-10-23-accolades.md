<p>
  Professor of women's studies Bettina Aptheker received a Phenomenal Woman Award from California State University, Northridge, on October 7. Aptheker was one of five honorees and was recognized for teaching and scholarship, with special mention of her book, <i>Tapestries of Life,</i> which is used as a text in Northridge core courses. On the day before the ceremony, Aptheker met with students and faculty at a luncheon in her honor, during which <i>Tapestries of Life</i> and two of her other books--<i>The Morning Breaks: The Trial of Angela Davis</i> and <i>Woman's Legacy: Essays on Race, Sex, and Class in American History</i>--were discussed. The Phenomenal Women Awards began in l995; the title comes from a poem by Maya Angelou with the same title. Award recipients also received the Certificate of Congressional Recognition from a local congressman and a Certificate of Recognition from Robert M. Hertzberg, Speaker of the California State Assembly.
