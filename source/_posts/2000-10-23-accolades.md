#### Bettina Aptheker

Aptheker was one of five honorees and was recognized for teaching and scholarship, with special mention of her book, _Tapestries of Life,_ which is used as a text in Northridge core courses. On the day before the ceremony, Aptheker met with students and faculty at a luncheon in her honor, during which _Tapestries of Life_ and two of her other books--_The Morning Breaks: The Trial of Angela Davis_ and _Woman's Legacy: Essays on Race, Sex, and Class in American History_\--were discussed.
