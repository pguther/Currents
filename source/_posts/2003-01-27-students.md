Six UCSC students, who San Jose police say were present during a fraternity  
brawl in that city on January 21, will be interviewed by the UCSC judicial  
officer to determine if their behavior warrants disciplinary action.  

UCSC administrators have also decided to temporarily suspend the UCSC chapter of the students' fraternity, Pi Alpha Phi, pending an investigation to determine if the chapter has violated UCSC regulations.  

The six students were among approximately 70 questioned by San Jose police following an early-morning fight that involved members of San Jose State University chapters of Pi Alpha Phi and Lambda Phi Epsilon.

One person died during the fight and numerous other participants were injured; all of the victims were SJSU students.
