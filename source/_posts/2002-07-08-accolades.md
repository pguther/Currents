  <a name="Talamantes" id="Talamantes"></a>Endocrinologist Frank Talamantes receives E. E. Just Award
</h3>
<p>
  The American Society of Cell Biology (ACSB) has chosen Frank Talamantes, professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology, to receive the E. E. Just Award. The award will be presented at the society's annual meeting in December in San Francisco. As part of the award, Talamantes will deliver a lecture at the meeting.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The award, named in memory of the eminent biologist Ernest Everett Just, recognizes outstanding scientific achievement by a minority scientist. The awardee is selected by the ASCB Minorities Affairs Committee.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Talamantes, who is vice provost and dean of the Division of Graduate Studies, is an endocrinologist who has done pioneering research on a family of hormones called placental lactogens and on the growth hormone receptor. The placental lactogens and the growth hormone receptor are proteins that play crucial roles during pregnancy. Talamantes and his laboratory colleagues have elucidated the structures of these proteins and their genes. They have also investigated the factors involved in modulating their expression during pregnancy and the effects of placental lactogens on target organs such as the mammary gland. In addition, Talamantes is working to understand the protective effect that pregnancy has against breast cancer.
