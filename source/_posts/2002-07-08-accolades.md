Accolades

### Endocrinologist Frank Talamantes receives E. E. Just Award

The American Society of Cell Biology (ACSB) has chosen Frank Talamantes, professor of molecular, cell, and developmental biology, to receive the E. E. Just Award. The award will be presented at the society's annual meeting in December in San Francisco. As part of the award, Talamantes will deliver a lecture at the meeting.  

The award, named in memory of the eminent biologist Ernest Everett Just, recognizes outstanding scientific achievement by a minority scientist. The awardee is selected by the ASCB Minorities Affairs Committee.   

Talamantes, who is vice provost and dean of the Division of Graduate Studies, is an endocrinologist who has done pioneering research on a family of hormones called placental lactogens and on the growth hormone receptor. The placental lactogens and the growth hormone receptor are proteins that play crucial roles during pregnancy. Talamantes and his laboratory colleagues have elucidated the structures of these proteins and their genes. They have also investigated the factors involved in modulating their expression during pregnancy and the effects of placental lactogens on target organs such as the mammary gland. In addition, Talamantes is working to understand the protective effect that pregnancy has against breast cancer.

Computer scientist James Whitehead receives award for conference paper

Computer science assistant professor James Whitehead was given the Engelbart award for best paper at the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Hypertext 2002 conference in June. His award-winning contribution is titled "Uniform Comparison of Data Models Using Containment Modeling." The conference had a 31 percent acceptance rate, and his paper was the best of the 15 full-length papers presented at the conference. The ACM is one of two major organizations for computer professionals; the other is the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers.
