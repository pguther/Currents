UCSC researchers and industry reps meet to discuss data storage systems  
  
UCSC faculty and students in the Storage Systems Research Center (SSRC) met with computer industry representatives for two days last week to exchange ideas on the future of data storage. The SSRC, one of the major research groups in the Baskin School of Engineering, is focused on improving the performance, security, and reliability of data-storage systems.   

The SSRC Research Review meeting included presentations from both SSRC researchers and industry representatives. The meeting serves as an opportunity for the center to get feedback from industry sponsors, said SSRC director and professor of computer science Darrell Long.  

Companies represented at the meeting included Hewlett-Packard, Hitachi Global Storage Technologies, IBM, Engenio Information Technologies, Network Appliance, and Veritas Software. Researchers from Lawrence Livermore and Los Alamos National Laboratories also attended the meeting.   

"There is an ongoing need for improvements in data-storage technologies. The SSRC is doing good work in this area, and we have been very supportive of the center," said John Muth, principal engineer at Veritas, a leading storage software company.  

In addition to support from industry sponsors, the SSRC receives major funding from the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy. The center includes 10 faculty members and about 20 graduate students from the Computer Science, Computer Engineering, and Electrical Engineering Departments. Their research focuses on caching, storage systems hierarchies, large-scale distributed storage systems, security, and performance.
