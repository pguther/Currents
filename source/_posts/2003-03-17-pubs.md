  New book by John Brown Childs looks at preserving diversity in the midst of globalization
</p>
<p>
  <img align="right" height="302" src="../art/transcommunality_cover.jpg" width="200" alt="">Sociology professor John Brown Childs has published a new book, <i>Transcommunality: From the Politics of Conversion to the Ethics of Respect</i> (Temple Univ. Press; 2003). The book presents Childs's vision of how groups, communities, and nations can preserve their uniqueness while engaging across race, class, and gender in a new social movement he calls "transcommunality."<br>
</p>
<p>
  As a resource for Childs's development of the concept of transcommunality, the second part of the book includes 12 commentaries by a diverse range of authors, several of whom have UCSC affiliations, including Bettina Aptheker, professor of women's studies; Hayden White, University Professor Emeritus of history of consciousness; Guillermo Delgado-P., a lecturer in Latin American and Latino studies; and Herman Gray, professor of sociology.<br>
</p>
<p>
  As Childs says, he "did not want to have a monologue about dialogue," so he invited commentators to expand on the idea of transcommunality in their own ways.<br>
</p>
<p>
  A major consequence of globalization in the 21st century, observes Childs, is the emergence of a "monoculture" that contributes to both homogenization and fragmentation of people. What remains, he says, is the basic human desire for social affiliation and rootedness in place and in systems of belief.<br>
</p>
<p>
  As people are broken down by global forces into "ever more atomized elements," Childs believes that constructive responses are blending heterogeneity and cooperation to produce resistance and freedom.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "I propose that there is a way to both maintain particularistic rooted affiliations and create broad constellations of inclusive cooperation that constructively draw from such diversity," Childs writes. "I call this way of cooperation transcommunality."
