The latest information on "The War on Terror: A Credible Threat"--a daylong teach-in that will take place on Monday, April 24, at the UCSC Quarry Amphitheater--can be found at: [www.facultyagainstwar.org/][1]. The web site contains an updated speaker schedule, parking information, and directions to the Quarry.

The 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. public event will feature nationally known speakers for a day of reflection on U.S. international politics and university life. Former U.S. ambassador to Iraq Joseph Wilson--the husband of outed CIA operative Valerie Plame--will be among the featured speakers, along with U.S. Representative Sam Farr; prominent law professors from UCLA, UC Berkeley, Columbia, and Georgetown University; Santa Cruz mayor Cynthia Mathews; senior UCSC faculty members; and Chancellor Denton. Admission is free.
