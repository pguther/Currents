### Hawaiian poet and playwright to perform March 7

Leilani Chan, an internationally known poet and playwright, will perform her one-women show "E Nana I Ke Kumu: Look to the Source" on Thursday, March 7, at 8 p.m. in the Porter College Dining Hall. Interweaving hula, poetry, monologue, and music, Chan will deconstruct Hawaii's stereotypical lei-wearing, surf-boarding society.

A native Hawaiian, Chan has worked as a performer, writer, director, and producer at many multicultural theaters, which has led to the development of the Los Angeles based [TeAda Productions][4]. As artistic director and founder of TeAda Productions, Chan has united many of L.A.'s ethnic communities in performances that offer authentic stories for, by, and about people of color.

Admission is free for UCSC students with ID and $5/general. The performance is sponsored by the Asian American/Pacific Islander Resource Center._
