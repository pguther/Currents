</h3>Leilani Chan, an internationally known poet and playwright, will perform her one-women show "E Nana I Ke Kumu: Look to the Source" on Thursday, March 7, at 8 p.m. in the Porter College Dining Hall. Interweaving hula, poetry, monologue, and music, Chan will deconstruct Hawaii's stereotypical lei-wearing, surf-boarding society.

As artistic director and founder of TeAda Productions, Chan has united many of L.A.'s ethnic communities in performances that offer authentic stories for, by, and about people of color.
