The first presentation of a traveling physics demonstration developed by physicists at the Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics with local high school teachers attracted local and national media attention. The event at Aptos High School, which included 4-foot bolts of electricity striking an instructor in a special metal outfit, was covered by KSBW (Channel 8) and the _Watsonville Register-Pajaronian,_ and also led to a story on ABCNews.com (see "[Zapping Teachers for Science][1]"). Physics professor **Hartmut Sadrozinski** and physics lab manager **Charles Crummer** were featured in the coverage along with local teachers.

Agroecology director **Carol Shennan** was interviewed by the History Channel for a program on the history of farming. . . . Speaking of the Farm, Kathy Kreiger at the _Santa Cruz County Sentinel _helped get the word out about Tracy Chapman's upcoming benefit concert by leading off her weekly gardening column with the news.  

A story in the _Santa Cruz Sentinel _about humpback whales seen recently feeding close to shore featured the comments of **Alejandro Acevedo**, a graduate researcher in the Institute of Marine Sciences.
