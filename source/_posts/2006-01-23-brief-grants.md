<p>
  Five UCSC graduate students have been awarded small grants to support their interdisciplinary research in the areas of ocean health and marine-related environmental change.
</p>
<p>
  The grants, administered by the Center for the Dynamics and Evolution of the Land-Sea Interface (CDELSI), are made possible by an anonymous donation intended to foster outstanding interdisciplinary graduate education in coastal environmental change at UCSC. Students will each receive $2,700 to be used for research expenses related to their cross-disciplinary work.
