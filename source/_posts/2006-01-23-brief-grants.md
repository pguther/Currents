Five UCSC graduate students have been awarded small grants to support their interdisciplinary research in the areas of ocean health and marine-related environmental change.

The grants, administered by the Center for the Dynamics and Evolution of the Land-Sea Interface (CDELSI), are made possible by an anonymous donation intended to foster outstanding interdisciplinary graduate education in coastal environmental change at UCSC. Students will each receive $2,700 to be used for research expenses related to their cross-disciplinary work.

This year's recipients and their research topics are:

**Frank Black,** Ph.D. student in environmental toxicology  
_Upwelling of Dimethylmercury in Monterey Bay as a Potential Source of Monomethylmercury to the Atmosphere and Coastal Rainwater_

**Cristie Boone**, Ph.D. student in anthropology  
_Prehistoric Fishing Practices in the Monterey Bay, with Potential Effects on Local Marine Ecosystems_

**Melissa Foley**, Ph.D. student in ecology and evolutionary biology  
_Nearshore Iron Concentration and Kelp Beds along the Big Sur Coast_

**Katie Alt Griffith**, Ph.D. student in ocean sciences  
_Distribution of _Cuscuta salina_ at Elkhorn Slough_

**Stacy Jupiter**, Ph.D. student in ecology and evolutionary biology  
_From Cane to Coral Reefs: Ecosystem Connectivity and Estuarine and Marine Responses to Land Use Intensification_
