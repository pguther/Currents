  UCSC trio teams up to publish children's book about time
</p>
<p>
  Psychology professor Dom Massaro's fascination with time stems from a visit to his son's second-grade class, where Massaro observed youngsters having trouble learning to tell time.
</p>
<p>
  That experience inspired him to invent a kid-friendly clock, the award-winning Kid Klok. His curiosity piqued, Massaro went on to explore the history of time and timekeeping, which he now shares with readers of the new book <i>Time to Learn About Time,</i> coauthored by Don Rothman and illustrated by Bill Rowe.
</p>
<p>
  The book is tailored for youngsters ages 8 to 12, though adults will learn a lot, too, including how clocks are made, why clocks run clockwise (think sundials, which mimic how a shadow moves in the Northern Hemisphere, where the sundial was invented), and the origin of the "a.m." and "p.m." designations for the two halves of the day.
</p>
<p>
  Massaro, a professor of psychology at UC Santa Cruz, teamed up with Rothman, a writing instructor and director of the UCSC-based Central California Writing Project, to write the text, and he tapped Rowe, a research associate in the Division of Natural Sciences, for the line drawings of everything from Cronus, the Greek god of agriculture, to the gear mechanisms of a mechanical clock.
</p>
<p>
  In this age of digital watches, Massaro makes a case for preserving the analog clock, which he said helps develop important abstract, perceptual, and cognitive skills.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "The traditional clock is a leftover from history, not an efficiently designed, easy-to-read device like a digital timepiece," said Massaro. "But no one should assume digital time will replace analog clocks. After all, analog clocks have withstood the test of time."<br>
  <br>
  <i>Time to Learn About Time</i> is available through amazon.com and at Kaleidoscope in Capitola.
