It's not too soon to start thinking about Banana Slug Spring Fair, scheduled for April 28, 2007.

The Alumni Association is encouraging colleges, divisions, and departments--as well as student groups and ethnic resource centers--to begin planning now for the Banana Slug Spring Fair Reunion Weekend.

The web site for BSSF is [ alumni.ucsc.edu/reunions/index.html][1], where you can also check out last year's events.  
  
The timeline for BSSF 2007 is as follows:  
* Event descriptions, including time, place, and faculty attending, to Alumni Office by December  
* College funding requests due to the Alumni Office by January 19 (or sooner)  
* Save the date e-mail and/or postcards sent by you in January and early February   
* _UCSC Review_ magazine drop early March  
* Postcard invitations from you sent by March 16  
* Alumni Association invitation mailing March 16  
* Reminder e-mail around April 13  
* R.S.V.P. deadline: April 20
