<p>
  It's not too soon to start thinking about Banana Slug Spring Fair, scheduled for April 28, 2007.
</p>
<p>
  The Alumni Association is encouraging colleges, divisions, and departments--as well as student groups and ethnic resource centers--to begin planning now for the Banana Slug Spring Fair Reunion Weekend.
</p>
<p>
  The web site for BSSF is <a href="http://alumni.ucsc.edu/reunions/index.html">alumni.ucsc.edu/reunions/index.html</a>, where you can also check out last year's events.<br>
  <br>
  The timeline for BSSF 2007 is as follows:<br>
  * Event descriptions, including time, place, and faculty attending, to Alumni Office by December<br>
  * College funding requests due to the Alumni Office by January 19 (or sooner)<br>
  * Save the date e-mail and/or postcards sent by you in January and early February<br>
  * <i>UCSC Review</i> magazine drop early March<br>
  * Postcard invitations from you sent by March 16<br>
  * Alumni Association invitation mailing March 16<br>
  * Reminder e-mail around April 13<br>
  * R.S.V.P. deadline: April 20
