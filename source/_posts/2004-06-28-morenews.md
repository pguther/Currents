Name change for UCSC Inn and Conference Center

The UCSC Inn and Conference Center will be knows as the University Inn and Conference Center beginning July 1. A new sign in front of the hotel will reflect the change.  

"The change of name comes from input our guests have given us over the course of the last couple of years. It is unclear from the name that hotel rooms are available to the general public," said Alma Sifuentes, director of Residential and Dining Services. "The change in name is a slight one," she said, "but we feel that it will make a significant difference in welcoming guests not affiliated with the university, particularly during summer months."
