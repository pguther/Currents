  Before it was devastated by Hurricane Katrina last August, New Orleans was a city of contradictions.
</p>
<p>
  Known for its distinctive architecture and atmosphere that meshed elements of African American, Anglo- American, French, Cajun, Spanish and Caribbean culture, it boasted a tourism industry that annually generated nearly $5 billion.
</p>
<p>
  But the city was less known for its gritty culture of everyday life that was far removed from the tourist image projected around the world.
</p>
<p>
  Hurricane Katrina exposed the city's contradictions, and current struggles over New Orleans's future have raised critical questions about catastrophe, race, social justice, urban renewal, memory, and the image and marketing of cities.
</p>
<p>
  New Orleans is now being forced to confront radically different ideas of exactly what a city is, and what are the responsibilities of local and national institutions to rebuild its communities, preserve its architecture, resolve its inequalities, and honor its memory.
</p>
<p>
  In light of these events, the UCSC Center for Cultural Studies will present a one-day conference, "Reflections on Katrina: Place, Persistence &amp; the Lives of Cities" on Saturday, January 21, from 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. at Oakes College, Room 105. The conference is the second of three quarterly events in 2005-06 that are part of the Center for Cultural Studies' three-year "Other Globalizations" project, funded by the Rockefeller Foundation. It was organized by by Phil Steinberg, a Florida State University associate professor of geography and a Rockefeller Fellow at the Center for Cultural Studies. Admission is free and open to the public.
</p>
<p>
  "The aftermath of Katrina has revealed much about the deeply layered character of the global city," noted associate professor of literature Christopher Connery. "We hope that this event will contribute to our understanding of New Orleans's history, political economy, and future. We also hope to stimulate new thinking about our attachment to cities, and how they are inhabited, imagined, and remembered," Connery added.
</p>
<p>
  Mike Davis, professor of history at UC Irvine, will deliver the keynote address: "Gentrifying Disaster," beginning at 10:15 a.m. Davis's research combines interests in political economy, urban planning, and perceptions of disasters. His most recent book is <i>The Monster at Our Door: The Global Threat of Avian Flu</i> (New Press, 2005).
