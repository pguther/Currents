Chancellor Denice D. Denton received the 2006 Educator Award from the National Organization of Gay and Lesbian Scientists and Technical Professionals (NOGLSTP).

Denton accepted the award at the group's meeting February 19 during the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS) conference in St. Louis.

The award is given to the Gay Lesbian Bisexual Transgender Ally educator who has enabled "significant growth for GLBT students in science or technology" through teaching, counseling, advocacy, role modeling, or other educational roles.

Denton was called "an outstanding role model" to the GLBT community by showing that "being out at work, including your life partner in a public manner," and obtaining career success, are not mutually exclusive parameters.

Denton said she was honored by the award particularly since it came "from her peers." In a brief address to the group she spoke of working to achieve excellence through diversity and the importance of supporting and mentoring GLBT students in science and technology.
