Alma Martinez's research focuses on the cross-influences of Chicano and Latin American popular political theater from 1965 to 1976. Her dissertation, "Un Continente, Una Cultura?: The Political Dialectic for a United Chicano, Mexican and Latin American Popular/Political Theatre Front," is a comparative analysis of the political and cultural dialectics involved in the production of "agitprop" theater across the Americas.  
  
As a performer, Martinez has worked extensively in theater, television, and film. She is currently starring in the role of the family matriarch, Mama Chu, in Luis Valdez's _Mummified Deer_ at El Teatro Campesino in San Juan Bautista, California.
