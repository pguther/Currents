  UC faculty, staff, students, and friends are invited to a day of hiking and educational activities in the White Mountains on Sunday, August 6. This event is cosponsored by the University of California White Mountain Research Station (WMRS), Friends of WMRS, and the Inyo National Forest.
</p>
<p>
  The event will combine interpretive programs and natural history walks at the Bristlecone Pine Visitor Center, an open house at White Mountain Research Station High-Altitude Research Facility at Mt. Barcroft, and an opportunity for hikers to ascend the 14,246 ft. White Mountain Peak. This is a once-a-year opportunity to drive up to the Barcroft Station, listen to WMRS researchers talk about the high-altitude research, see poster displays, enjoy light refreshments, and purchase souvenirs.<br>
  <br>
  The gate to the Barcroft facility will open at 7 a.m. and close at 6 p.m. Carpooling is highly recommended as parking is limited. Friends of WMRS (wearing orange vests) and research station faculty and staff will be on hand to answer your questions. Researchers' talks at the Barcroft facility will begin at 10 a.m. and end at 4 p.m.
</p>
<p>
  The Barcroft Laboratory is the 11th-highest research station in the world and fourth-highest in North America. The summit laboratory is the fourth-highest research facility in the world and the highest in North America.
