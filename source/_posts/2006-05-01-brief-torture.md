Former British Ambassador to Uzbekistan, Craig Murray, will speak on U.S. and British sanctioned torture in Uzbekistan prisons on Friday, May 5, from noon to 2 p.m. at the Stevenson College Fireside Lounge. Admission is free and open to the public.

Murray was fired after he released classified documents affirming the existence of torture and U.S. and British complicity in it. Last fall, he was a key witness at the International Commission of Inquiry on Crimes Against Humanity by the Bush Administration held in New York City.

UCSC psychology professor Craig Haney, an authority on U.S. prisons, the death penalty, and torture, will comment on Ambassador Murray's presentation. An open discussion will follow. The event will be moderated by feminist studies professor Bettina Aptheker.

This event is sponsored by [Faculty Against War][2], Cultural Studies, the Institute for Advanced Feminist Research, and the [Santa Cruz County Chapter of the ACLU][3].
