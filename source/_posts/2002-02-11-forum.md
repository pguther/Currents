Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood will address a range of issues at the Winter Staff Forum from 11:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. on Wednesday, February 27, in Earth and Marine Sciences Room B206.

Greenwood plans to offer updates on the budget, including the status of the campus hiring freeze, and on campus emergency preparedness, then answer staff members' questions on those or other subjects.

The "brown bag" forum is sponsored by the Chancellor's Office and the Staff Advisory Board.
