Aida Hurtado, professor of psychology, has been named the new director of the [Chicano/Latino Research Center][1] (CLRC). Her three-year term begins July 1\.

Hurtado succeeds anthropology professor Olga Najera-Ramirez.

Hurtado, who is head of the social psychology doctoral program at UCSC, focuses her research on the study of social identity (including ethnic identity), Latino educational issues, and feminist theory. She was recently elected chair of the National Association for Chicana/Chicano Studies, the largest organization representing ethnic studies in the United States. Her books include _The Color of Privilege: Three Blasphemies on Race and Feminism; Voicing Feminisms: Young Chicanas Speak Out on Sexuality and Identity_; and _Chicana Feminisms: A Critical Reader_, coedited with Gabriela Arredondo, Norma Klahn, Najera-Ramirez, and Patricia Zavella. Her latest book is _Chicana/o Identity in a Changing U.S. Society: ?Quien soy? ?Quienes somos?_ coauthored with Patricia Gurin.

Founded in 1992, the center supports research on Latina/o and Latin American issues with a goal of promoting "crossborder perspectives linking the Americas." The CLRC fosters collaborative work among scholars in the United States, Mexico, Central America, and South America, as well as among scholars at UCSC. The center supports interdisciplinary approaches that span the social sciences, humanities, and cultural studies. Much of the center's work focuses on transborder issues that reflect the movement of populations back and forth across the borders of North, Central, and South America. The center also sponsors cultural events that are open to the public, including film screenings, lectures, and workshops.

About 40 UCSC faculty members are CLRC research associates, and nearly 30 graduate students are doing work on Chicano/Latino themes under the auspices of CLRC.
