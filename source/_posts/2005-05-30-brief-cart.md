It's easy to grab a bag of fresh organic salad mix or a sumptuous bouquet at the UCSC Farm & Garden market cart, which opens for the summer on Friday, June 3.

Located at the main entrance to campus, the popular produce and flower stand brings the fresh organic bounty of the Farm & Garden to cooks and flower lovers Tuesday and Friday afternoons from noon until 6 p.m.   

The array of fresh organic fruits and vegetables grows as the season progresses, but early offerings include strawberries, tender lettuces, sweet carrots, tasty beets, and chard. As summer progresses, watch for sweet corn, flavorful dry-farmed tomatoes, gourmet potatoes, an array of sweet and hot peppers, apples, basil and other herbs, and more.  

All proceeds benefit the UCSC Center for Agroecology & Sustainable Food Systems' apprenticeship program in ecological horticulture. For more information, call (831) 459-3240.
