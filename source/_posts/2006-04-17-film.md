  A video by two UCSC undergraduates won the Jim Demulling Speak Out Award for Best Social Awareness Commentary in a Documentary at the Humboldt International Short Film Festival.

  In the video "Generation War," filmmakers Meaghen Keyser and Caitlin Lindsey look at the experiences of three Vietnam veterans, including Keyser's father, who are living in northern California. They used the stories and experiences of the older vets as a lens through which to view the current occupation of Iraq and the subsequent creation of another generation of war veterans.

  The students, both seniors, made the documentary while enrolled in the course <i>Video Production of the Social Documentary</i> taught by Renee Tajima-Pena, associate professor of community studies.

  "Meaghan and Caitlin are great students--they've both completed field studies in radio but are distinguishing themselves in video, too," said Tajima-Pena.
