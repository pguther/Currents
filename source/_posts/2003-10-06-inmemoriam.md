In Memoriam

Mark Christensen, UCSC's second chancellor

Mark N. Christensen, second chancellor of UC Santa Cruz, and a distinguished professor at UC Berkeley for almost four decades, died October 2 at his home in Carmel. He was 73.

Christensen served as chancellor at UCSC from July 1974 through January 1976\. Prior to his appointment as chancellor at the age of 45, Christensen had served as vice chancellor at Berkeley, the principal aide to then-Chancellor Albert Bowker.

After serving as chancellor at UCSC, Christensen returned to UC Berkeley as a professor of geology and geophysics. He retired in 1994 as a professor emeritus of energy and resources.

A celebration of Mark Christensen's life will be held on November 2 from 1 to 4 p.m. at the UC Berkeley Faculty Club. [Directions to the UCB Faculty Club][1]
