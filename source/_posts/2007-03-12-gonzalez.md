By Scott Rappaport

History of art and visual culture associate professor Jennifer Gonzalez has received a $16,000 publication grant from the Wyeth Foundation for American Art in suppport of her forthcoming book: _Subject to Display: Restaging Race in Contemporary Installation Art_ (MIT Press). The grant is awarded through the College Art Association to support the publication of books on American art.

Gonzalez said her book will focus on the works of James Luna, Fred Wilson, Amalia Mesa-Bains, Pepon Osorio, and Renee Green. "These artists have drawn attention to the fact that the collection and display of artifacts is a primary means by which a nation tells the story of its past and locates the cultures of its citizens in the present," said Gonzalez. "By creating gallery installations or by working directly with museum archives, these artists have played a pivotal role not only in the transformation of contemporary art and museum culture, but also in reviving the history, narrative, and biography of otherwise marginalized subjects."

Gonzalez has written for periodicals such as _Frieze, Diacritics, Inscriptions, Art Journal,_ and _Bomb._ She has also contributed chapters to _The Encyclopedia of Aesthetics_ (1995), as well as books such as _With Other Eyes: Looking at Race and Gender in Visual Culture_ (1999), _Race in Cyberspace_ (2000), and _Only Skin Deep: Changing Visions of the American Self_ (2005).
