The UC Travel Council is asking travelers and travel coordinators to take a few minutes and complete a short online [travel survey][1].

The UC Travel Council, working under the direction of UC senior management, is comprised of representatives from all 10 campuses and both labs. The Travel Council is designing a comprehensive travel management program for the UC system; negotiating new contracts for airfare, hotels, and car rentals; and exploring other tools that are easy to use and cost effective.

Input from travelers and travel coordinators is essential to the success of this project. The answers to the survey questions will help the Travel Council design a management program that supports the needs of UC travelers, travel arrangers, and travel preparers.

The online survey is available through December 1 at [survey.chr.ucla.edu/research/tc0607sourc.htm][1]
