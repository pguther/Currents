  <a name="UCTV" id="UCTV"></a>UCTV programming focuses on literature during the month of October
</p>
<p>
  From John Steinbeck to Jane Smiley, literature takes center stage on UCTV this month. Contrasting the frenzied competition for "younger audiences" on commercial television networks, UCTV offers a distinctly alternative mix of book and poetry readings, author interviews, commentary, and thought-provoking discussion. October's special focus is being promoted through libraries, book clubs, and local media with the slogan "Words Worth Watching."
</p>
<p>
  On October 26, UCTV will premiere "Trampling Out the Vintage: Steinbeck and The Grapes of Wrath" a new documentary examining the genesis and history of the novel and its hold on the American imagination, featuring interviews with the author's son, Thom Steinbeck, and with UC faculty at several campuses including Berkeley, Davis, UCLA, and Santa Cruz.
</p>
<p>
  For a complete list of programs and broadcast times, visit the <a href="http://www.uctv.tv/words">UCTV</a> web site.
</p>
<p>
  Community Television of Santa Cruz County has expanded its carriage of UCTV programming on Channel 25 (AT&amp;T Broadband) to include the 8 to 11 p.m. block on Sunday evenings.<br>
