  Elizabeth A. Penaat, a founding member of UC Santa Cruz's administrative staff who later became a vice chancellor on campus, died on Thursday, April 25, at Dominican Hospital in Santa Cruz after a lengthy illness. She was 68.<br>
  <br>
  Named vice chancellor for operations and employee affairs at UCSC in 1975, Penaat was one of the first women named to oversee the business operations of a major U.S. university. "Elizabeth not only was an important figure in UCSC's founding, her subsequent promotion to vice chancellor helped pave the way for a generation of female administrators across the country," said Harold Hyde, who in 1964--a year before UCSC opened to students--asked Penaat to join the administrative team that was establishing the campus. <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/news_events/press_releases/01-02/04-29.penaat.html">See press release</a>.
