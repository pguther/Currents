Elizabeth A. Penaat, a founding member of UC Santa Cruz's administrative staff who later became a vice chancellor on campus, died on Thursday, April 25, at Dominican Hospital in Santa Cruz after a lengthy illness. She was 68.  
  
Named vice chancellor for operations and employee affairs at UCSC in 1975, Penaat was one of the first women named to oversee the business operations of a major U.S. university. "Elizabeth not only was an important figure in UCSC's founding, her subsequent promotion to vice chancellor helped pave the way for a generation of female administrators across the country," said Harold Hyde, who in 1964--a year before UCSC opened to students--asked Penaat to join the administrative team that was establishing the campus.
