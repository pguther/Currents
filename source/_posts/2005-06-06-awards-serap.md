  Chancellor Denton (first row, center) hosted the 11th Annual Student Employee Recognition Award Ceremony at University House on May 20. The ceremony honored 277 students for their academic excellence and outstanding service to the university this year. Supervisors gave their students certificates of appreciation and cash awards ranging from $100 to $2,000, totaling $57,000.

  Barbara Bedford, executive director of the Career Center, which sponsors the event, welcomed the group, and she was followed by student speakers Jackie Bertuleit, Jessica Pierce, Woo Suk (Will) Sim, and Liam Welcher. Between presentations, the audience, including parents, siblings, campus leaders, faculty, and staff, was entertained by Big Mac and the Insomniacs and vocalist Carla St. Juste, a UCSC student. Student Cynthia Payne videotaped the ceremony for later broadcast on Community TV.
