  UCSC senior custodian Maria Elena Alcantar has been named Woman of the Year for the 27th Assembly District by Assemblyman John Laird. Each year, assembly members select one of their constituents for Woman of the Year honors.

  "I'm inspired by Maria Elena Alcantar's focus on creating a brighter future for her family and her coworkers," said Laird. "Maria Elena has worked tirelessly to improve working conditions at UCSC while building education opportunities for her children."

  Laird recognized Alcantar on the floor of the Assembly in a March 20 ceremony.
