The [Recreation Department][1] is offering a weekend Wilderness First Aid class April 14-15. Instruction and certification will be provided by the Wilderness Medicine Institute (WMI) of the National Outdoor Leadership School (NOLS).

Fast-paced and hands-on, this course covers a wide range of wilderness medicine topics for people who travel in the outdoors. It is ideal for trip leaders, camp staff, outdoor enthusiasts, and individuals in remote locations.

WMI's curriculum is unique and includes many advanced topics that other programs leave out such as dislocation reduction, focused spinal assessment, and epinephrine administration.

The course will take place at Stevenson College, Room 175, from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. both days. The cost is $175. Register online at [www.ucscrecreation.com][2]

WMI's course is pre-approved by such organizations as the American Camping Association, the United States Forest Service, and other governmental agencies. This course may also be used to recertify Wilderness First Responders - go to [www.ucscrecreation.com][2] for more information on this.
