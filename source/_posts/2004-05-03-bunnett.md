  Amos B. Smith III, the Rhodes-Thompson Professor of Chemistry at the University of Pennsylvania, will give the 2004 Joseph F. Bunnett Research Organic Chemistry Lecture on Friday, May 7, at 4 p.m. in the University Center.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The title of Smith's talk is "Total Synthesis of Architecturally Complex Natural and Unnatural Products: Challenges, Excitement, and Frustrations."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Smith's research interests encompass three diverse areas: natural product synthesis, bioorganic chemistry, and materials science. His laboratory has prepared more than 75 architecturally complex natural products. Smith is editor-in-chief of <i>Organic Letters,</i> the first journal developed through a collaboration between the American Chemical Society and SPARC (Scholarly Publishing &amp; Academic Resources Coalition), which was established with the goal of distributing research results faster and at significantly less cost. He has received numerous awards and honors, including most recently the 2003 Yamada Prize from the Japan Research Foundation for Optically Active Compounds.<br>

  The Bunnett Lecture series is hosted by the Department Chemistry and Biochemistry in honor of Professor Emeritus Joseph Bunnett. For additional information, call the department at (831) 459-4002.<br>
