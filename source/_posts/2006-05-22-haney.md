Craig Haney, professor of psychology, has received two top honors recently.

His book, _Death by Design_, received the Herbert Jacob Book Prize from the Law and Society Association for the "outstanding book in law and society scholarship" published in 2005.

Haney also received the 2005 Arthur C. Helton Human Rights Award from the American Immigration Lawyers Association for his work on a study of asylum seekers in the United States. Haney and other members of the study team from the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom received the award in "recognition of outstanding service advancing the cause of human rights."

The award was created to honor the late Arthur Helton, director of the Council on Foreign Relations, who was an international human rights activist who dedicated his life to easing the plight of refugees around the world. Helton was killed in the August 2003 bombing of the United Nation headquarters in Baghdad.
