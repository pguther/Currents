Students, staff, and faculty members are invited to attend a special campus workshop of the Santa Cruz County Transportation Funding Task Force.

The session, led by Fred Keeley, former State Assemblymember and current Santa Cruz County treasurer, will take place from 6:30 to 9 p.m. on Tuesday, May 16, at the Stevenson Event Center. The workshop will focus on UCSC-related traffic issues.

The task force is gathering input to develop a package of new local transportation projects and funding with a wide base of support throughout the county. Public workshops on traffic issues are being conducted in each supervisorial district in Santa Cruz County.

Those wishing to submit input online may do so via the [transportation funding workbook ][1]on the task force web site, [www.tftaskforce.org][2].
