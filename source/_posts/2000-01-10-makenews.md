A year-end story in the _San Francisco Chronicle_ headlined "Bay Area Brains" featured two UCSC scientists--Chancellor **M.R.C. Greenwood** and astronomer **Steven Vogt**.

Vogt has handled the media attention surrounding his planet-hunting exploits with much patience and good humor, and for a recent story in the _Napa Valley Register_ he even provided a helpful analogy between planet hunting and wine making.
