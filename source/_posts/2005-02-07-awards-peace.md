  UC Santa Cruz graduates are continuing to make their mark in the Peace Corps, coming in sixth among medium-sized campuses nationwide in the latest ranking for number of volunteers.
</p>
<p>
  UCSC has 52 alumni serving around the world as Peace Corps volunteers, the same number as last year. Since the Peace Corps' inception in 1961, 557 UCSC alumni have joined.

  The University of Wisconsin at Madison retained its longtime top ranking in the large colleges and universities ranking, with 123 volunteers. The University of Virginia again claimed the top spot for medium schools, with 84 volunteers, and the University of Chicago topped the small school list with 39 volunteers. Iowa's Grinnell College--with an enrollment of just over 1,500--had the distinction of having the best per-capita volunteer rate with 23 alumni currently serving.

  Most of the UC campuses are included in the top 25. In the large colleges and universities category, UC Berkeley is fourth with 94 volunteers; UC Santa Barbara is 17th with 57; UCLA is 18th with 55, and UC Davis and UC San Diego are tied for 25th, with 43 volunteers each.<br>
