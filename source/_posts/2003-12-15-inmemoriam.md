In Memoriam

UCSC Foundation trustee Thomas Rees dies at 78

Thomas Rees, a UCSC trustee since 1998 and former member of the Friends of Long Marine Laboratory board, died of cancer on December 9. He was 78\.

"UC Santa Cruz has lost a special friend," Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood said. "Our campus benefited greatly from Tom Rees's many years of service as a trustee of the UC Santa Cruz Foundation. Individuals who are elected to public office are generally addressed as 'the honorable,' and Tom truly exemplified the qualities that deserve that respect. We will always be grateful for the privilege of knowing and working with such a distinguished gentleman."  

Rees, an attorney who retired to Santa Cruz County in the 1980s, served in the California Assembly and Senate as well as the U.S. House of Representatives, representing Los Angeles County. First elected to the Assembly in 1954, Rees was an outspoken liberal on civil rights and loyalty oaths, among other issues. Rees won a special election to Congress in 1965, where he was a vocal opponent of the Vietnam War. He retired from Congress in 1976.

A memorial service will be arranged later.  

The family prefers that memorial donations be made to the Friends of Long Marine Lab or to Hospice of Santa Cruz County.
