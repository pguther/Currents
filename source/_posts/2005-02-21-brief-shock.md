UCSC's Institute for Advanced Feminist Research (IAFR) will present a reading from _Shock and Awe: War on Words_ on Tuesday, March 1, at 7:30 p.m. at Capitola Book Cafe.

Coedited by Bregje van Eekelen, Jennifer Gonzalez, Bettina Stotzer, and Anna Tsing, with Jody Greene as the managing editor, _Shock and Awe: War on Words_ is the first book to be published in the IAFR series, "Feminist Provocations," as well as the first book by New Pacific Press, a venture recently started by David Watson, owner of The Literary Guillotine in Santa Cruz.

_Shock and Awe: War on Words_ grew out of the activities of the IAFR's working group, Feminisms and Global War. Its contributors are both local and global. For more information about the book, go to the [Currents story][1].
