UCSC has just wrapped up a weekend of celebration, with events including the dedication of two new colleges and a special scholarships dinner.  

On Saturday, UCSC formally inaugurated College Nine and College Ten, the first new residential colleges to be opened on campus in nearly 30 years.  

Dignitaries, students, faculty, and alumni participated in a panel presentation and dedication ceremonies for College Nine and College Ten. The event took place in the Colleges Nine and Ten Multipurpose Room and out on the lawn.

Saturday evening, the campus hosted a first annual Scholarships Benefit Dinner to raise money for undergraduate and graduate students.

Richard C. Atkinson, who stepped down as UC President on October 1, was presented with the first UCSC Foundation Medal at the event in recognition of his leadership.

The medal was designed and created by sculptor Sean Monaghan, a 1983 graduate of Kresge College. The heart of the medal is a composite lens of three wedges, with the center arc made of Zerodur, a glass/ceramic used for astronomical mirrors.

This wedge was cut from a remainder piece of the Keck Telescope's Primary Mirror.   

"UCSC is melding the undergraduate experience with the research experience," said Atkinson in accepting the award. "UCSC has taken off, achieved a remarkable position," he said, adding that "the uniqueness of this medal describes the uniqueness of this institution."

More than 300 people--including alumni, elected officials, students, faculty and staff--attended the dinner at the Colleges Nine and Ten Multipurpose Room.  

On Sunday, October 12, current and alumni recipients of the Karl S. Pister Leadership Opportunity Awards Program Scholarships gathered for a reunion brunch.

Established in 1993, the program helps students from 13 regional community colleges transfer to UCSC.
