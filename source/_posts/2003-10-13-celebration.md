<p>
  UCSC has just wrapped up a weekend of celebration, with events including the dedication of two new colleges and a special scholarships dinner.<br>
</p>
<p>
  On Saturday, UCSC formally inaugurated College Nine and College Ten, the first new residential colleges to be opened on campus in nearly 30 years.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Dignitaries, students, faculty, and alumni participated in a panel presentation and dedication ceremonies for College Nine and College Ten. The event took place in the Colleges Nine and Ten Multipurpose Room and out on the lawn.
</p>
<p>
  Saturday evening, the campus hosted a first annual Scholarships Benefit Dinner to raise money for undergraduate and graduate students.
</p>
<p>
  Richard C. Atkinson, who stepped down as UC President on October 1, was presented with the first UCSC Foundation Medal at the event in recognition of his leadership.
</p>
<p>
  The medal was designed and created by sculptor Sean Monaghan, a 1983 graduate of Kresge College. The heart of the medal is a composite lens of three wedges, with the center arc made of Zerodur, a glass/ceramic used for astronomical mirrors.
</p>
<p>
  This wedge was cut from a remainder piece of the Keck Telescope's Primary Mirror.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "UCSC is melding the undergraduate experience with the research experience," said Atkinson in accepting the award. "UCSC has taken off, achieved a remarkable position," he said, adding that "the uniqueness of this medal describes the uniqueness of this institution."
</p>
<p>
  More than 300 people--including alumni, elected officials, students, faculty and staff--attended the dinner at the Colleges Nine and Ten Multipurpose Room.<br>
</p>
<p>
  On Sunday, October 12, current and alumni recipients of the Karl S. Pister Leadership Opportunity Awards Program Scholarships gathered for a reunion brunch.
</p>
<p>
  Established in 1993, the program helps students from 13 regional community colleges transfer to UCSC.<br>
