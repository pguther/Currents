  Ehud Baruch's research interests include representation theory, automorphic forms, and L-functions. Baruch is currently working on the proof of a long-standing conjecture in the theory of representations of "Lie groups," which was formulated in 1962 by the mathematician A. A. Kirillov. Baruch received his B.S. and M.S. degrees in mathematics from Technion in Israel and his Ph.D. in mathematics from Yale University. He was awarded a Sloan Dissertation Fellowship in 1995 and was Zassenhaus Assistant Professor of Mathematics at Ohio State University from 1995 to 1998. Before joining the UCSC faculty, Baruch was a research fellow at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel.
