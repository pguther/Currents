Ehud Baruch's research interests include representation theory, automorphic forms, and L-functions. Baruch is currently working on the proof of a long-standing conjecture in the theory of representations of "Lie groups," which was formulated in 1962 by the mathematician A. A. Kirillov. Baruch received his B.S. and M.S. degrees in mathematics from Technion in Israel and his Ph.D. in mathematics from Yale University. He was awarded a Sloan Dissertation Fellowship in 1995 and was Zassenhaus Assistant Professor of Mathematics at Ohio State University from 1995 to 1998. Before joining the UCSC faculty, Baruch was a research fellow at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel.

Scott Brandt's current research interests include computer-operating systems, soft real-time processing, and storage systems. He has conducted research in many areas of computer science, including soft real-time processing, distributed processing, secure operating systems, computer vision and robotics, asynchronous computer architecture, image processing, and virtual reality. Brandt received a B.S. in mathematics and M.S. in computer science from the University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, and a Ph.D. in computer science from the University of Colorado at Boulder. Before pursuing his Ph.D., Brandt was a senior computer scientist at Secure Computing Corporation, senior research scientist at Alliant Techsystems Research and Technology Center, founder and vice president of Theseus Research, and senior research scientist at Honeywell Systems and Research Center. He was also a computer science instructor at the University of Colorado at Boulder.
