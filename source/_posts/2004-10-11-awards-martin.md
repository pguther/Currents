Lora Lee Martin, director of the UC [Monterey Bay Education, Science, and Technology (MBEST) Center][1], has been elected to serve on the Board of Directors of the [Association of University Research Parks (AURP)][2]. A nonprofit international organization, AURP represents planned technology developments--alternatively referred to as research parks, science parks, or technology parks--which are designed to promote university-industry relations, foster innovation, and facilitate the transfer of technology from universities to the private sector.

"I'm looking forward to working with the board and members of AURP to further the effectiveness of university economic development initiatives and the role the research parks are playing in spurring innovation," Martin said.

UCSC established the UC MBEST Center as a cornerstone of the Fort Ord redevelopment effort. The center focuses on developing collaborative research-business opportunities in the Monterey Bay Crescent region.
