Ingrid Parker, associate professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, has been awarded a Fulbright Scholar grant to teach and do research at the University of Panama during the 2005-06 academic year.

The grant will support Parker's work on a project titled "Applied plant ecology in Panama: Building intellectual capital and assessing the impact of 'genetic pollution' in a tropical forest tree."

Parker is one of approximately 800 U.S. faculty and professionals who will travel abroad to some 140 countries for the 2005-06 academic year through the Fulbright Scholar Program. Recipients of Fulbright Scholar awards are selected on the basis of academic or professional achievement and because they have demonstrated extraordinary leadership potential in their fields.

The Fulbright Program is sponsored by the U.S. Department of State, Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs. Established in 1946 under legislation introduced by the late Senator J. William Fulbright of Arkansas, the program aims to build mutual understanding between the people of the United States and other countries.
