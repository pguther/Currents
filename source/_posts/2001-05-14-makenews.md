Sociologist **Marcia Millman** has scored a major overseas media hit with her book about romance and the movies. The_ Times_ of London published a lengthy story; she has been interviewed twice by BBC Radio; she appeared in Scotland's largest daily newspaper; and she has fielded calls from reporters at _Oggi, _Italy's largest weekly newsmagazine, and _Petra,_ Germany's largest women's weekly magazine. On this side of the Atlantic, she was interviewed by the _Santa Cruz Sentinel_ and is scheduled to appear on KUSP Radio with Eric Schoeck next week.

The Science Illustration Program's annual exhibit at the Natural History Museum, which runs from May 5 to June 10, garnered a nicely illustrated spread in the _Santa Cruz Sentinel. _Instructor **Ann Caudle** and several of the students were featured in the story.

**Manuel Pastor**'s recent study of toxics in Los Angeles received coverage on KQED Radio's _California Report,_ in the _Santa Cruz Sentinel_ and the _San Francisco Chronicle,_ on KSTS TV in San Jose, and a Washington, D.C.-based Spanish-language wire service.
