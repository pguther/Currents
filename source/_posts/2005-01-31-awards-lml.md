Kelp forests, dolphins, coral reef fish, and a broad range of other subjects in the marine sciences are under investigation in 19 student research projects supported this year by the Friends of Long Marine Lab Student Research Awards. The awards will provide a total of $11,200 in research funding for the student projects, which were selected by a proposal review committee.

The award recipients were recognized last week at a special ceremony and reception held at the Seymour Marine Discovery Center. In addition, the Friends of Long Marine Lab will honor the top two student research award recipients--Olivia Cheriton and Itchung Cheung, both graduate students in ocean sciences--with a special award to be presented at the annual Global Oceans Gourmet Dinner, a f20 undraising event for the Friends of LML that will take place March at the Bittersweet Bistroin Aptos. (For ticket information, call (831) 459-3694.)

The Friends of LML provides funding for public education, marine mammal programs, and student research, as well as the development and operation of the Seymour Center. The Student Research Awards come from the interest generated by six different endowments: The Jane McHenry Student Awards Fund, the Lillian McPherson Rouse Student Award Fund, the William Baye Heald Scholarship Fund, the Friends of LML Student Support Fund, the Mark T. MacMillan Memorial Prize Fund, and the Ken Norris Marine Mammal Research Award.
