  Mikhail Rudenko, a graduate student in electrical engineering, received a Young Investigator prize for his presentation at a recent meeting, the 2007 SPIE Photonics West/BIOS Conference in San Jose. The $750 prize--awarded by PicoQuant, a German company that makes lasers and fluorescence systems--was split between Rudenko and Heidi Dietrich of Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands. According to a PicoQuant press release, the quality of the talks was so high "it proved extremely difficult for the jury to nominate the winner."

  Rudenko works in the Applied Optics Group led by Holger Schmidt, associate professor of electrical engineering. The title of his talk was "Integration and characterization of SiN nanopores for single-molecule detection in liquid-core ARROW waveguides."
