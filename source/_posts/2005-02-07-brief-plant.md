The 2005 UCSC Plant Research Symposium on Saturday, February 12, will bring together researchers from throughout the campus who share an interest in plants. The symposium will take place at the UCSC Arboretum from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m.

More than 50 participants from 21 laboratories in seven different departments are expected to attend, as well as staff from the Arboretum, Natural Reserve System, Greenhouse, and Campus Grounds, said symposium organizer Ingrid Parker, associate professor of ecology and evolutionary biology.

Research from natural, agricultural, and model systems as well as field, greenhouse, and laboratory settings will be presented in scheduled talks and posters. Presentations will include molecular, physiological, and ecological plant research.

The symposium is sponsored by the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences and the Division of Social Sciences, the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology, the Department of Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology, the Department of Environmental Studies, and the STEPS Institute for Innovation in Environmental Research.
