<p>
  Assistant professor of art and electronic media Elliot Anderson will have a solo exhibition at the <a href="http://www.thinker.org/deyoung/index.asp">de Young Museum</a> in San Francisco, opening on January 13 and running to May 15. Titled "Average Landscapes," the show is part of the de Young's Connections Gallery series.
</p>
<p>
  Anderson's work examines the relationship between 19th-century American landscape painting and contemporary tourist photography. "Using custom software I search the Internet for images based on titles of paintings by Hudson River School painters -- people such as Thomas Cole, Albert Bierstadt, Frederic Edwin Church, and Thomas Moran," said Anderson. "The software returns everyday snapshots of the places represented in the paintings. I then average these images together using additional custom software to create a merged image that contains ghosts of all the images collected."
</p>
<p>
  The exhibition will contain 13 large-scale digital transparencies mounted on ligthboxes, a series of "souvenir" plates with digital transfers of the landscapes, and video.
</p>
<p>
  The <a href="http://www.thinker.org/deyoung/index.asp">de Young</a> is located at 50 Hagiwara Tea Garden Drive, in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park.
