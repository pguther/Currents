Demonstrators gathered at the two entrances to campus on Monday morning to join in a national protest intended to show the impact immigrant workers have on the nation's economy. The demonstration occurred as Congress is debating new immigration legislation.

The campus was open on what was called "A Day Without Immigrants," but morning commute traffic to UCSC was slowed by the rallies at both the main and west entrances. The demonstration, which appeared to involve mostly UCSC students, also included a number of staff, faculty, and community members.

After a noon-hour rally at the main entrance to campus, participants marched down Bay Street to join other community demonstrations.
