The student callers in the Telephone Outreach Program hit a new record at the end of the fiscal year 2005 campaign, raising $1,177,114. The funds will benefit all areas of campus, including academic divisions, McHenry Library, departments and departmental programs, scholarships and fellowships, resource centers, colleges, and undergraduate research and internships.  

The Telephone Outreach Program is sponsored by the Annual Fund office and employs a student staff of 30. The students contact more than 17,000 alumni, parents, and friends of the university for private support. The TOP effort is led by Zack Weigert-Derr, assistant director of the Annual Fund, and program assistants Jennifer Dunn and Stephanie Wong.

The campuswide [Cornerstone Campaign][1] helped propel the 2005 TOP campaign into a record year with its focus on scholarships and fellowships. Many donors recognize the importance of making a university education accessible and were ready to help compensate for ever-decreasing state funding.
