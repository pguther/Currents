  The student callers in the Telephone Outreach Program hit a new record at the end of the fiscal year 2005 campaign, raising $1,177,114. The funds will benefit all areas of campus, including academic divisions, McHenry Library, departments and departmental programs, scholarships and fellowships, resource centers, colleges, and undergraduate research and internships.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The Telephone Outreach Program is sponsored by the Annual Fund office and employs a student staff of 30. The students contact more than 17,000 alumni, parents, and friends of the university for private support. The TOP effort is led by Zack Weigert-Derr, assistant director of the Annual Fund, and program assistants Jennifer Dunn and Stephanie Wong.

  The campuswide <a href="http://giving.ucsc.edu/">Cornerstone Campaign</a> helped propel the 2005 TOP campaign into a record year with its focus on scholarships and fellowships. Many donors recognize the importance of making a university education accessible and were ready to help compensate for ever-decreasing state funding.<br>
