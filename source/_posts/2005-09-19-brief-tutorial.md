UCSC's [NetTrail,][1] an online tutorial at the University Library, has been selected by the Association of College & Research Libraries' Instruction Section as the PRIMO (Peer-Reviewed Instructional Materials Online) Site of the Month for October 2005.

PRIMO, formerly known as the Internet Education Project (IEP), is a means to promote and share peer-reviewed instructional materials created by librarians to teach people about discovering, accessing, and evaluating information in networked environments. The Association of College & Research Libraries believes that publicizing selective, high-quality resources will help librarians respond to the educational challenges posed by emerging digital technologies.

UCSC's NetTrail members include Christy Caldwell, Christy Hightower, Ann Hubble, Danielle Kane, Ken Lyons, and Debbie Murphy.
