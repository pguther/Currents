  UCSC's <a href="http://nettrail.ucsc.edu">NetTrail,</a> an online tutorial at the University Library, has been selected by the Association of College &amp; Research Libraries' Instruction Section as the PRIMO (Peer-Reviewed Instructional Materials Online) Site of the Month for October 2005.
</p>
<p>
  PRIMO, formerly known as the Internet Education Project (IEP), is a means to promote and share peer-reviewed instructional materials created by librarians to teach people about discovering, accessing, and evaluating information in networked environments. The Association of College &amp; Research Libraries believes that publicizing selective, high-quality resources will help librarians respond to the educational challenges posed by emerging digital technologies.

<p>
  UCSC's NetTrail members include Christy Caldwell, Christy Hightower, Ann Hubble, Danielle Kane, Ken Lyons, and Debbie Murphy.
