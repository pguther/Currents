**Benjamin Friedlander**

![][1]Professor of Electrical Engineering  
  
Benjamin Friedlander's general area of interest is statistical signal processing and its applications to communication systems and radar and sonar systems. He is working on problems related to cellular communications; direction finding and source localization; the use of antenna arrays for communications; and advanced time-frequency representations for signal analysis. Some of his research has potential applications in improving the capacity of cellular telephone networks. Friedlander received his B.S. and M.S. degrees in electrical engineering from Technion in Israel and an M.S in statistics and a Ph.D. in electrical engineering from Stanford University. Before joining the UCSC faculty, he was a professor of electrical and computer engineering at UC Davis.

#### **Colin W. Leach**

Assistant Professor of Psychology  
  
Colin Leach is a social psychologist whose research areas are social comparison and intergroup relations. He examines the ways in which people compare themselves to others, both better and worse off, and how those comparisons make them feel about themselves, others, and their environment. His work on intergroup relations in the U.S. and Western Europe focuses on the interplay of psychology and politics in ideology. Leach earned his Ph.D. from the University of Michigan and had a chancellor's postdoctoral fellowship at UC Berkeley. He comes to UCSC from Swarthmore College.
