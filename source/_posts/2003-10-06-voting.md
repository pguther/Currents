  The Student Union Assembly is reminding students to vote on Tuesday, October 7.
</p>
<p>
  The issues on the ballot are the proposal to recall the governor, the selection of a new governor if the current governor is replaced, Proposition 53, and Proposition 54.
</p>
<p>
  Voters are allowed to vote for a replacement candidate for governor even if they vote "no" on the recall.
</p>
<p>
  Polls are open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m.
</p>
<p>
  For City of Santa Cruz poll locations or questions, call the Santa Cruz County Elections Department at (831) 454-2060.
</p>
<p>
  * More information on propositions 53 &amp; 54 visit, <a href="http://www.voterguide.ss.ca.gov/propositions/propositions.html">http://www.voterguide.ss.ca.gov/propositions/propositions.html</a>

  <b>If you have moved and forgot to reregister, vote by Provisional Ballot</b>
</p>
<p>
  * If you were registered to vote at your previous address in the County of Santa Cruz, or resided on campus in student housing, you are eligible to vote by provisional ballot on Tuesday, October 7, if you have moved since last November 2002.
</p>
<p>
  * On Election Day, Tuesday, please go to any polling place throughout Santa Cruz and ask to cast a Provisional Ballot. You will need to fill out an updated voter registration form to reflect your current address when you request your Provisional Ballot.
</p>
<p>
  * Please consider voting early in the day- casting a Provisional Ballot will probably take several additional minutes to process.<br>
