Astrophysicist Claire Max honored by Alameda County  

Professor of astronomy and astrophysics Claire Max was inducted last week into the Alameda County Women's Hall of Fame. Max, who lives in Berkeley, was honored for her contributions to science on March 8 during the 10th Annual Women's Hall of Fame Awards ceremony.

Max, an associate director of the Center for Adaptive Optics, has done pioneering work on the development of adaptive optics systems for large telescopes to minimize the blurring effects of turbulence in Earth's atmosphere. She has worked at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL) for 29 years and currently holds joint appointments at LLNL and UCSC. Her group at LLNL built the adaptive optics system currently in use at Lick Observatory, and she has also been closely involved in the design and implementation of the adaptive optics system at the W. M. Keck Observatory in Hawaii.  

The Women's Hall of Fame was established in 1993 by the Alameda County Board of Supervisors, the Alameda County Commission on the Status of Women, and the Alameda County Health Care Foundation. Its purpose is to recognize outstanding women for their achievements and contributions to the overall well-being of the county and its residents.
