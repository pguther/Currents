  Slawek Tulaczyk, associate professor of Earth sciences, will take part in "Science on Stage," an unusual theater production at the Exploratorium in San Francisco on Wednesday, September 14.
</p>
<p>
  Science on Stage 2005, presented by the Magic Theater in partnership with the Exploratorium, is the fifth annual series of script-in-hand performances of new plays about science and technology. In three dramatic readings, followed by discussions with the playwright and a scientist, the series explores topics ranging from autism to global warming and offers a glimpse of plays in the making.
</p>
<p>
  This year's series begins with <i>The Ice Breaker</i> by David Rambo. Tulaczyk, an expert on glaciers and global warming, will take the stage to answer questions from the audience after the play is over. The presentation begins at 7 p.m. in the McBean Theater at the Exploratorium.
</p>
<p>
  In <i>The Ice Breaker,</i> a young Ph.D. student on the verge of a momentous discovery seeks an ally in a disgraced genius. Cold science gives way to warm emotion, leading them to reveal the passions and demons that drive their quests.
</p>
<p>
  <i>The Ice-Breaker,</i> directed by Art Manke, will receive a full production in February 2006 as part of Magic's 2005-06 season, presented by the Magic Theatre, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Science &amp; Technology Initiative, and the Martha Heasley Cox Raw Play Series.
</p>
<p>
  For advance tickets, please call the Magic Theatre's Box Office at (415) 441-8822. Admission is free for Magic subscribers, Exploratorium members, or with same-day museum admission.<br>
