Slawek Tulaczyk, associate professor of Earth sciences, will take part in "Science on Stage," an unusual theater production at the Exploratorium in San Francisco on Wednesday, September 14.

Science on Stage 2005, presented by the Magic Theater in partnership with the Exploratorium, is the fifth annual series of script-in-hand performances of new plays about science and technology. In three dramatic readings, followed by discussions with the playwright and a scientist, the series explores topics ranging from autism to global warming and offers a glimpse of plays in the making.

This year's series begins with _The Ice Breaker_ by David Rambo. Tulaczyk, an expert on glaciers and global warming, will take the stage to answer questions from the audience after the play is over. The presentation begins at 7 p.m. in the McBean Theater at the Exploratorium.

In _The Ice Breaker,_ a young Ph.D. student on the verge of a momentous discovery seeks an ally in a disgraced genius. Cold science gives way to warm emotion, leading them to reveal the passions and demons that drive their quests.

_The Ice-Breaker,_ directed by Art Manke, will receive a full production in February 2006 as part of Magic's 2005-06 season, presented by the Magic Theatre, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation Science & Technology Initiative, and the Martha Heasley Cox Raw Play Series.

For advance tickets, please call the Magic Theatre's Box Office at (415) 441-8822. Admission is free for Magic subscribers, Exploratorium members, or with same-day museum admission.
