The majority of the fire alarm communication links with dispatch, damaged by last weekend's lightning strikes, have been repaired. In those locations where repairs are still under way, Physical Plant staff are communicating directly with affected units.

Physical Plant staff wish to remind members of the campus community that in case of emergency they should always dial 911.

If you have questions regarding the status of specific buildings, contact the Physical Plant work order desk at (831) 459-4444.
