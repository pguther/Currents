  With toe-tappin' music, hay rides, pumpkin painting, and delectable edibles, the annual UCSC Harvest Festival is always a great way to celebrate the changing of the seasons.
</p>
<p>
  This year's festivities take place Saturday, October 8, from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. at the UCSC Farm.
</p>
<p>
  Admission is free for kids 12 and under and for members of the Friends of the UCSC Farm &amp; Garden; adult admission is $5; UCSC students pay $3 with ID.
</p>
<p>
  Three bands will provide live music throughout the day, while youngsters will enjoy activities that also include face painting and apple pressing.
</p>
<p>
  Everyone loves the annual apple tasting, while bakers will want to dust off their rolling pins and enter the fourth-annual Apple Pie Bake-Off (see below for entry rules). Local herbalist and acupuncturist Darren Huckle will lead herb walks through the garden, and rose lovers will want to attend a talk by Orin Martin, manager of the Alan Chadwick Garden, about "Year-Round Organic Rose Care." As always, cooking demonstrations and guided Farm tours round out the offerings. Community groups will have booths set up for browsing, and a number of local farmers will be selling their produce as part of the "Buy Fresh, Buy Local" campaign. See below for the full schedule of events.
</p>
<p>
  The Harvest Festival is sponsored by the UCSC Center for Agroecology &amp; Sustainable Food Systems; proceeds benefit the Friends of the UCSC Farm &amp; Garden. Major business sponsors include Christiansen Associates Organic Gardens &amp; Design, New Leaf Community Markets, and Stonyfield Farm. For more information call (831) 459-3240.
