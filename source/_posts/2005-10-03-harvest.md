With toe-tappin' music, hay rides, pumpkin painting, and delectable edibles, the annual UCSC Harvest Festival is always a great way to celebrate the changing of the seasons.

This year's festivities take place Saturday, October 8, from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. at the UCSC Farm.

Admission is free for kids 12 and under and for members of the Friends of the UCSC Farm & Garden; adult admission is $5; UCSC students pay $3 with ID.

Three bands will provide live music throughout the day, while youngsters will enjoy activities that also include face painting and apple pressing.

Everyone loves the annual apple tasting, while bakers will want to dust off their rolling pins and enter the fourth-annual Apple Pie Bake-Off (see below for entry rules). Local herbalist and acupuncturist Darren Huckle will lead herb walks through the garden, and rose lovers will want to attend a talk by Orin Martin, manager of the Alan Chadwick Garden, about "Year-Round Organic Rose Care." As always, cooking demonstrations and guided Farm tours round out the offerings. Community groups will have booths set up for browsing, and a number of local farmers will be selling their produce as part of the "Buy Fresh, Buy Local" campaign. See below for the full schedule of events.

The Harvest Festival is sponsored by the UCSC Center for Agroecology & Sustainable Food Systems; proceeds benefit the Friends of the UCSC Farm & Garden. Major business sponsors include Christiansen Associates Organic Gardens & Design, New Leaf Community Markets, and Stonyfield Farm. For more information call (831) 459-3240.
