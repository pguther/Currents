Psychology's emeriti have been out in force lately. **Elliot Aronson** penned an op-ed on school violence for the _Los Angeles Times_ following the Michigan tragedy. And his colleague **Tom Pettigrew** was tapped by the _Times,_ as well as the _San Francisco Examiner,_ for comment on John McCain's use of a derogatory term to refer to his captors in Vietnam.

Continuing their quest for planets outside the solar system, professor of astronomy and astrophysics **Steven Vogt** and his colleagues recently discovered the smallest extrasolar planets yet detected, although these Saturn-size planets are still much larger than Earth. Vogt was interviewed by local TV stations KION-Channel 46 and KSBW-Channel 35 and was quoted in the _Santa Cruz County Sentinel._ His role in the findings was also mentioned in articles in the _New York Times, San Francisco Chronicle, San Jose Mercury News,_ and in an Associated Press wire story.

The _San Jose Mercury News_ sought the expertise of **Manuel Pastor** for a story on changes among the Latino electorate. **Pastor** also coauthored a commentary for the _Los Angeles Times_ about pollution risks faced by minorities in southern California.

**The Farm** was a lovely backdrop for a recent CNN story about Aptos organic foods maven Nell Newman.

Russia's recent presidential election kept political scientist **Michael Urban** busy fielding media calls from the BBC, as well as KPFK Radio in Los Angeles.
