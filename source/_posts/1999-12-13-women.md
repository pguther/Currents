  One of the country's oldest and most respected programs in women's studies turns 25 this year. The program is UCSC's very own, which was established in 1973-74 and sent its first graduates into the world in 1974-75.
</p>An interdisciplinary program, <a href="http://humwww.ucsc.edu/wst/index.html">women's studies</a> incorporates numerous fields, including history, literature, politics, sociology, and philosophy.
<p>
  A sign of its prestige and broad-based appeal is the fact that the department attracts more adjunct professors (more than 50 this year) than any other at UCSC.
</p>
<p>
  To mark its anniversary, the department is hosting two years of special events. Among them are the following:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Molly Ivins: One of the nation's wittiest and best known political pundits, Ivins will be in Santa Cruz to present a talk titled "Campaign 2000."

Sunday, March 26, 8 p.m., Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium.<br>
