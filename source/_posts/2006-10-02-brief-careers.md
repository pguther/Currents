Three events--two focusing on business, finance, science, and engineering--are part of a crowded Career Center schedule for October.

On October 10, a panel of four or five employers representing the business, finance, science and engineering industries will talk about working within these industries and how students can best prepare to network with employers. The panelists will also be available to answer questions at the 4-6 p.m. event in Conference Room D of the Bay Tree Building. All students are welcome to attend, and they do not need to present identification. The employer panel is the first session in a two-part symposium.

The second part, October 17, will be a networking session with employers in the business, finance, science and engineering fields. Students will have the chance to meet employers to find a job or internship. The fair will take place from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. in the Stevenson Event Center. Students must present their student ID cards to attend. [Event details and a complete listing][1] of participating employers are available online.

On October 23, students will be able to find out more about an array of institutions at the Graduate and Professional School Fair from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. at the West Field House. The fair is open to all registered students with student ID. A complete [listing of participating schools][2] is available online.
