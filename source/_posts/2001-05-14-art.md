**Young artists' works on display at Women's Center**

It was a special Mother's Day at the Women's Center, where young artists and their parents gathered to celebrate the opening of the center's Children's Art Show.  

  
The show, which features works by children of UCSC staff, students, and faculty, boasts paintings, life-size three-dimensional paper sculptures of people, collages, and paper mache creations. The artwork will be on display in the Women's Center through May 20.

Butterflies, mermaids, fish, rainbows, flowers, birds, self-portraits, and suns brighten the walls and dangle from the ceilings, bringing a smile to the face of Donna Hamilton, who came up with the idea of a children's art show a year ago.

"I had a show of my own paintings here last year, and a lot of kids came to the reception," said Hamilton, as she marveled at the range of artwork. "I thought it would be great to have a kid's art show here."

Hamilton, who lives in faculty housing with her husband, John, and son, Jasper, distributed flyers throughout their neighborhood. Women's Center program coordinator Helen Mayer spread the word to campus child care facilities. Together, their work paid off as the art flooded in.

"We wanted to build community with faculty housing and the Women's Center," said center director Roberta Valdez. "Then it expanded to include student housing, and it kept expanding until it turned into this Mother's Day event."

Also adorning the walls is the beautiful quilt made by UCSC employee Pele Fleming as a fundraiser for campus child care programs. The colorful quilt incorporates drawings of faces by children at UCSC's three child care centers. Proceeds from a benefit drawing for the quilt will go toward the improvement of play yards in all campus child care programs. Tickets for the drawing will go on sale in June.
