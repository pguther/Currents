  Students, staff, and faculty are invited to celebrate the grand reopening of the restaurant at the University Center--now called Terra Fresca--on October 20. The celebration, which takes place from 4:30 to 6 p.m., will showcase the restaurant's new focus on fresh, organic, and sustainable foods.
</p>
<p>
  Visitors to the grand reopening will enjoy a buffet of special selections from the exciting new menu. They will also be able to meet several local growers who provide many of the ingredients for the delicious appetizers, salads, entrees, and desserts.
</p>
<p>
  The cost is $3 per person, and tickets may be purchased in advance at the University Center between 7 a.m. and 3 p.m., Monday through Friday, or at the door. Cash, check, MasterCard, Visa, or Flexi Dollars will be accepted, as well as equivalency meal plans (55/75).
