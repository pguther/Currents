Appointments

Laurie McCann appointed acting ombudsman

Laurie McCann has been appointed to the position of acting ombudsman. During 2001 and early 2002, McCann provided facilitation and strategic planning services to the campus under the aegis of the Office of Planning and Budget. She succeeds Sheila Gottehrer, who served as ombudsman from 1994 to 2001.   
  
Prior to coming to UCSC, McCann had her own business facilitating the resolution of complex multiparty negotiations in the areas of natural resource conflicts, state and local policy development, and labor/management contracts. She has also facilitated strategic planning for nonprofit organizations and mediated workplace disputes. She has been affiliated with the Center for Collaborative Policy in Sacramento and the Barber & Gonzales Consulting Group, which specializes in the negotiation of labor/management contracts. She holds an M.A. in psychology from UC Berkeley and is a former Peace Corps volunteer.

McCann is looking forward to the challenges of the position, with a particular emphasis on full confidentiality, impartiality, and informal resolution of problems. For several months, she has been convening a working group to discuss options for mediation services on campus.

McCann welcomes calls or e-mail from staff, faculty, and students who would like to learn more about the services of the Ombudsman's Office. She can be reached at (831) 459-2073 or by e-mail at[ Ombuds-lmc@ucsc.edu][1].
