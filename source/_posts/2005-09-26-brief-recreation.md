Join a moonlight kayaking paddle, a day hike from Big Basin State Park to Waddell Creek beach on the north coast, a wine tasting trip in Monterey County, or a backpacking trip to Yosemite. The Recreation Department is offering these and many other outdoor adventures this fall. There are also classes in a wide variety of interest areas, including Thai cooking, meditation, salsa dancing, survival skills, surfing, and guitar. The fall 2005 _Recreation, Intramural & Sports Guide_, available all over campus, describes the offerings in detail.

Students may sign up for Recreation classes beginning Tuesday, September 27, at 9 a.m. at the Recreation Office, East Field House. Staff and faculty may begin registering on Wednesday, September 28, at 9 a.m.
