  When psychology professor Aida Hurtado toured the White House as a graduate student nearly 20 years ago, it never occurred to her that she would return one day to discuss national educational policy with the president.
</p><br>
But that's what she did as part of a daylong White House Strategy Session on improving the achievement of Hispanic students. Hurtado, who helped coordinate the UC-wide Latino Eligibility Task Force in the early 1990s, was one of about 100 scholars, educators, and policy makers from around the country who were invited to attend the session.<br>
<br>
As a group, participants discussed five major educational objectives and then met with Bill Clinton in the White House.<br>
<br>
"It was amazing," said Hurtado. "The president stayed with us for 2 1/2 hours, which is unheard of, apparently. He usually just stays for the opening remarks or the ceremonial part of an event."<br>
<br>
The strategy session was the backdrop for the president's announcement of the formation of the 2010 Alliance, a partnership of corporate, foundation, and community leaders that will seek to double the number of Hispanic students who graduate from college over the next ten years. News of the alliance was covered in the <i>Los Angeles Times,</i> the <i>San Francisco Chronicle,</i> the <i>Chicago Tribune,</i> and the <i>Chronicle of Higher Education,</i> among other papers.<br>
<br>
The meeting was convened to identify strategies to reach the following Hispanic student achievement goals:
<ul>
  <li>Increase access to quality early childhood education
  </li>
  <li>Eliminate the achievement gap
  </li>
  <li>Ensure that Hispanic students achieve English language proficiency
  </li>
  <li>Increase the rate of high school completion
  </li>
  <li>Increase the college completion rate
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  "It's kind of sad, actually, because Clinton understands the problems so well, and he's laying the map and won't be able to carry it out," said Hurtado. "Somebody else will be elected. Hopefully he'll pick it up."<br>
  <br>
  Hurtado led the panel on eliminating the achievement gap in Hispanic educational achievement, which she said takes two forms: a high dropout rate and a lack of attention and resources directed to high-achieving Hispanic students. In 1998, Hurtado said, the dropout rate for Hispanics aged 16-24 was 30 percent--more than double the rate for blacks (14 percent) and more than three times the rate for whites (8 percent).<br>
  <br>
  "The emphasis in both research and policy is to focus on why students underachieve," she said. "But at the same time, there are also some high-achieving Hispanic students, and we are doing little to support them. Some high school students who are doing very well academically know absolutely nothing about how to apply to college, and that's hurting us in terms of the educational pipeline. And they are ones who are the most likely to come back and help the rest of the students in their school districts."<br>
  <br>
  The problem calls for a two-part strategy, said Hurtado: a long-term focus on improving the performance of K-12 students, and a short-term focus on helping high achievers move up to the next level of education.<br>
  <br>
  Hurtado said the gathering had historic as well as personal significance. "I thought I would be somewhat blase or unimpressed, but it was amazing, and it was historic, really, to have 100 Hispanic leaders in direct consultation with the president," she said. The discussion with Clinton, who was well-prepared, had a natural ebb and flow, said Hurtado. "It was very intimate, not at all stilted," she added.<br>
  <br>
  "They had gathered the right kind of people, committed people," said Hurtado. "There was a lot of passion in the room. And these are people who often work in isolation, feeling like they are the only ones worrying about these things."<br>
  <br>
  After the meeting, participants were invited to tour the entire first floor of the White House--the Red Room, the Green Room, the Blue Room--and attended a reception held in the state dining room. Hurtado mentioned a comment Clinton made after the reporters had left the press briefing.<br>
  <br>
  "He said he thinks he'll be the last non-Spanish speaking president in this country," she said. Clinton has learned to read Spanish but feels self-conscious speaking the language, whereas Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic nominee for president who addressed the meeting via satellite, sprinkled his ten-minute talk with four or five sentences in Spanish. Republican presidential contender George W. Bush has been studying Spanish much longer, but Gore's command of the language is better, said Hurtado.
