  <font size="5"><b>'Move-in' schedule has not changed</b></font>
</p>
<p>
  In anticipation of the new academic year, UCSC students are scheduled to begin moving into university housing on Thursday, September 13, and will continue doing so through Sunday, September 16, during UCSC's annual 'Move-in' activities.
</p>
<p>
  That schedule had <b>not</b> changed as a result of the terrorist attacks.
</p>
<p>
  If undergraduate students, parents, or guardians have a question or concern about the move-in schedule, they are advised to contact the College Administrative Officer (CAO) at the undergraduate student's assigned college.
</p>
<p>
  (If undergraduate students, parents, or guardians also have a concern that a student's return to Santa Cruz--either to move into university housing or for the start of classes on Wednesday, September 19--may be delayed by air-travel problems, please notify the CAO at the undergraduate student's assigned college.)
