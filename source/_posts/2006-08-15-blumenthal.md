Staff and faculty crowded the cafeteria at UCSC's 2300 Delaware satellite office Tuesday to get acquainted with [Acting Chancellor George Blumenthal.][1]

The event was the second in what will be a series of casual receptions to give members of the campus community a chance to meet Blumenthal, who was appointed July 14.

"This role is a new one for me," Blumenthal said, noting that he has been on the faculty since 1972. "When someone calls me chancellor, I look over my shoulder to see who they're talking to."

In brief remarks, Blumenthal said he wanted to be as accessible as possible, and encouraged the crowd to send him their comments and concerns via [e-mail][2].

"I guarantee that I will read it," Blumenthal said. "I want to be accessible. I want to hear from people at every level."

To further that goal, additional receptions are planned for other parts of campus. Details will be announced in _Currents Online. _
