  Staff and faculty crowded the cafeteria at UCSC's 2300 Delaware satellite office Tuesday to get acquainted with <a href="http://chancellor.ucsc.edu/">Acting Chancellor George Blumenthal.</a>
</p>
<p>
  The event was the second in what will be a series of casual receptions to give members of the campus community a chance to meet Blumenthal, who was appointed July 14.
</p>
<p>
  "This role is a new one for me," Blumenthal said, noting that he has been on the faculty since 1972. "When someone calls me chancellor, I look over my shoulder to see who they're talking to."
</p>
<p>
  In brief remarks, Blumenthal said he wanted to be as accessible as possible, and encouraged the crowd to send him their comments and concerns via <a href="http://chancellor.ucsc.edu/comment.shtml">e-mail</a>.
</p>
<p>
  "I guarantee that I will read it," Blumenthal said. "I want to be accessible. I want to hear from people at every level."
</p>
<p>
  To further that goal, additional receptions are planned for other parts of campus. Details will be announced in <i>Currents Online.</i>
