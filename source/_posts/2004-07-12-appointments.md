</p>
<p>
  Professor of philosophy Ellen Kappy Suckiel has been appointed provost of Stevenson College. Suckiel served as provost of UCSC's Kresge College from 1983 to 1989 and has been a member of the UCSC faculty since 1973. In addition to her internationally recognized scholarship on William James, the 19th-century American philosopher and psychologist, her recent research focuses on the ethics of biotechnology, genetic ethics, and the ethics of scientific research. "I am very much looking forward to working with Stevenson faculty, students, and staff," Suckiel said.
