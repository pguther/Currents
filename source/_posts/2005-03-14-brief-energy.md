Colleges and University Housing Services has received a $13,264 check from Pacific Gas & Electric (PG&E) as part of an energy-saving partnership.

The amount represents 50 percent of the total refund of $26,528 earned by upgrading existing lighting to more energy-efficient fixtures. CUHS will receive the balance upon completion of the project later this month. The energy-saving project is a cooperative effort of CUHS Facilities, Physical Plant and Dining Services.

In addition to the rebate, CUHS will continue to realize significant returns as energy costs decline, along with the added benefit of conserving resources.

Funding for the program comes from a $12 million PG&E grant to the University of California and California State University campuses. UCSC was the first UC or CSU campus to receive payment under the program. (See earlier [Currents story][1])
