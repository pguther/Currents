<p>
  Colleges and University Housing Services has received a $13,264 check from Pacific Gas &amp; Electric (PG&amp;E) as part of an energy-saving partnership.
</p>
<p>
  The amount represents 50 percent of the total refund of $26,528 earned by upgrading existing lighting to more energy-efficient fixtures. CUHS will receive the balance upon completion of the project later this month. The energy-saving project is a cooperative effort of CUHS Facilities, Physical Plant and Dining Services.
</p>
<p>
  In addition to the rebate, CUHS will continue to realize significant returns as energy costs decline, along with the added benefit of conserving resources.
</p>
<p>
  Funding for the program comes from a $12 million PG&amp;E grant to the University of California and California State University campuses. UCSC was the first UC or CSU campus to receive payment under the program. (See earlier <a href="http://currents.ucsc.edu/04-05/12-06/rebate.asp">Currents story</a>)
