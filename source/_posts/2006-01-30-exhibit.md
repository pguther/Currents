  UCSC's McHenry Library will present an exhibit honoring the late visionary feminist philosopher and writer Gloria Anzaldua through March 24.
</p>
<p>
  Anzaldua was a lecturer in the Women's Studies Department at UCSC where she influenced a generation of students, offering such courses as <i>Autohistorias</i> and <i>Women of Color in the United States</i>, before her untimely death in 2004. Anzaldua was also a graduate student in literature at UCSC and had nearly completed her Ph.D. at the time of her death; she was awarded her Ph.D. posthumously.
</p>
<p>
  "Anzaldua drew inspiration from an array of altars (<i>altares</i>) she created in her home near Lighthouse Point," noted exhibit curator Irene Reti. "We are happy to announce that the Special Collections department of the University Library is the new home for these <i>altares</i>. This exhibit situates the <i>altares</i> in the context of Anzaldua's writing."
</p>
<p>
  The altares will form the heart of a memorial to Anzaldua at the library, which will consist of:
</p>
<p>
  * A group study/memorial room named after her in the new, expanded McHenry Library, expected to open by 2010.
</p>
<p>
  * A revolving, small permanent exhibit in the memorial room featuring her altares and publications. (Some of the altares are also on permanent display at the UCSC Women's Center.)
</p>
<p>
  * Programming and library enrichment activities dedicated to her scholarship and vision.
</p>
<p>
  Anzaldua is the author of <i>Borderlands: La Frontera</i> (1987)--selected as one of the "100 Best Books of the Century" by both the <i>Utne Reader</i> and <i>Hungry Mind Review.</i> Her other published works include <i>This Bridge Called My Back: Writings by Radical Women of Color</i> (1981, coedited with Cherrie Moraga), a ground-breaking collection of essays and poems widely recognized by scholars in women's studies as the premiere multicultural feminist text.
