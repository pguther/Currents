  <b>Michael Riordan,</b> adjunct professor of physics, published a review in the <i>New York Times Book Review</i> of a new book by astronomer and cosmologist Robert P. Kirshner, <i>The Extravagent Universe: Exploding Stars, Dark Energy, and the Accelerating Cosmos.</i> The book discusses recent findings that the universe is not only expanding, its expansion is speeding up, indicating that some kind of antigravity is at work in the universe. "The universe is wilder than we ordinarily dare to imagine," Kirshner writes. In his review, Riordan said the book too often uses astrophysical jargon and scientific notation, but is "an excellent book for readers with some literacy in science."
