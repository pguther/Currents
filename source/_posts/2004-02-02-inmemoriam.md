In Memoriam

Karin Morse

Karin Morse, a longtime UCSC employee who retired in 2002, died on December 11 of surgical complications. She was 61.

Morse worked for the Office of Physical Education, Recreation, and Sports as facilities manager at the East Field House for over 19 years. One of the things she enjoyed most about her job was working with student employees, according to her friend Sue Dodge. Over the years she worked with hundreds of students, many of whom stayed in contact with her, said Dodge. After her retirement from UCSC, Morse worked for the Downtown Association of Santa Cruz as a hospitality guide.

Outside of work, Morse was active in organizations for the homeless and the unemployed.

A memorial service in celebration of Karin Morse's life will be held on February 7 at noon at Oakwood Memorial Park, 3301 Paul Sweet Road, Santa Cruz.

Donations in her name may be made to the Homeless Garden Project, P.O. Box 617, Santa Cruz, CA 95061-0617.
