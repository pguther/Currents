  There are some things we can do to help.
</p>
<p>
  The Red Cross is accepting financial donations, and you can mail them to the American Red Cross, 942 Lupin Drive, Salinas, CA 93906.
</p>
<p>
  The Santa Cruz Chapter of the American Red Cross said the national organization has not issued an emergency call for blood, but it is encouraging people to make appointments to give blood in the coming weeks to replenish supplies after the attacks.
</p>
<p>
  In Santa Cruz, the chapter only accepts donations of blood once a month. The next date is: Thursday, September 27, at the First Presbyterian Church, at Highway 1 and Mission Street, from 12:30 to 5:30 p.m. Please make an appointment first by calling 800-448-3543.
