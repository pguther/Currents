Students honored for service to campus  

![][1]

The Tenth Annual Student Employee Recognition Award Ceremony honored 220 student employees. Campus employers rewarded outstanding student service with a certificate of appreciation as well as a minimum $100 cash award. Student employees were able to invite their families and friends to attend. Acting Chancellor Martin M. Chemers (center of the photo) spoke, along with student speakers Daniel Ambrose from Student Life, Dione Cunningham from the African American Resource & Cultural Center, and Rachel Sanders from University Relations.   

The event, which was held on the lawn of University House, is organized each year by the Career Center staff.
