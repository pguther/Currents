UCSC Extension offers UCSC staff and faculty a discount of 30 percent on the enrollment fee for any course in its catalog. And now the process of enrolling in classes has been simplified. In the past, to access the discount (up to $150 for one class), employees had to have a form signed by their supervisor and the campus Training and Development Office. Now the employee enrolls directly with Extension, and Extension verifies and enrolls. Download the [enrollment form][1] (pdf format).

UCSC Extension offers a wide range of courses in fields such as biotechnology, databases and software, health care, interior design, networking and security, business and management, art, and personal growth. Courses are held both in Santa Cruz and Cupertino. For a complete listing of Extension's courses, go to [www.ucsc-extension.edu][2].
