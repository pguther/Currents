The third in an ongoing series of fundraising concerts for local nonprofit service agencies, this concert will benefit the Family Shelter Project of the Homeless Services Center. Donations in any amount will be accepted at the door; tax-deductible contributions may also be sent to the Homeless Services Center, attn.

Groundbreaking for the Family Shelter occurred in October 2003; completion is scheduled for November 2004. The shelter will assist homeless parents and their children to transition from a homeless situation to one of health and self-reliance, and will have 27 units housing up to 100 family members in a clean, safe, dignified, and supportive environment.

The facility will include central dining facilities serving three daily meals, laundry facilities, children's play areas, meeting rooms and lounges, and counseling rooms. Adjacent to the shelter is the Homelss Persons Health Project, which provides health care, mental health services, and substance abuse and treatment referrals. The site is adjacent to a city bus line and within walking distance of multiple employment opportunities in downtown Santa Cruz.
