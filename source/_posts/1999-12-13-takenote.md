**First Night Santa Cruz seeks volunteers****  
_  
_**First Night has become the New Year's Eve thing to do for residents of Santa Cruz County. Last year 30,000 people joined this community celebration of the arts in downtown Santa Cruz. First Night invites both individuals and groups to help create this year's celebration by volunteering to work at the event. Eight hundred volunteers are needed for a variety of tasks.   
  
For a three- to four-hour commitment, all volunteers receive a blinking-light admission button. There are special rewards for volunteers who work after 9 p.m. on December 31\. Volunteers who contribute more hours, such as site managers and set-up/clean-up crews, also receive a "Friends of First Night" sweatshirt and are invited to a thank-you party in the new year. Just like the regular admission button, the volunteer button can be used for free bus transportation to and from downtown Santa Cruz on December 31. For more information or to volunteer, call (831) 425-7277.

First Night has a Web site on which people can submit their hopes and wishes for the new millennium. The submissions will all be displayed on large windows downtown during the First Night event. [Webwall][1]****

**Editorial style guide on the Web**

[A Guide to Editorial Style][2] at the University of California, Santa Cruz, is posted on the Web. The editorial style guide is useful to all campus units preparing printed or online communications. It establishes a consistent editorial style for the campus and answers some frequently asked questions about general editorial usage and style. A list of further reference sources is appended. If you have questions, contact lance@cats.ucsc.edu.  

#### Benefits update for Health Net subscribers

Ongoing contract negotiations between Health Net and Sutter Health/Santa Cruz Medical Clinic could potentially affect between 900 and 1,000 current and retired UCSC employees. Negotiations were not concluded by the end of Open Enrollment on November 22, and the current contract expires on January 31. But the UCSC Benefits Office and the UC Office of the President have made special arrangements so affected employees will not be left without coverage with their chosen physicians, even if a new contract is not negotiated.  
  
Should the contract between Sutter Health/Santa Cruz Medical Clinic and Health Net be terminated, Health Net members enrolled with the Santa Cruz Medical Clinic will be provided with a special enrollment period to choose another health plan.   
  
Health Net members who are enrolled with the Santa Cruz Medical Clinic and wish to remain in Health Net do not need to take any special action. If a special enrollment period is necessary, details will be published in a future issue of _Benefits Update,_ and eligible Health Net members (those enrolled with Santa Cruz Medical Clinic) will receive a notice at their home address. Watch future issues of _Benefits Update_ for additional information.
