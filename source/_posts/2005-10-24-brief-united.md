<p>
  Programs and services as varied as Big Brothers/Big Sisters, Suicide Prevention Services, the "Transitions" Hospice Caring Project, Walnut Avenue Women's Center, and the Santa Cruz AIDS Project are funded by the Santa Cruz County United Way.
</p>
<p>
  The campus community will be asked to help out with these and other programs when the annual United Way campaign begins in late October.
</p>
<p>
  A new option this year is Spanish-language pledge forms, which may be downloaded from the UCSC <a href="http://united-way.ucsc.edu/">United Way website</a>.
</p>
<p>
  United Way's administration and fundraising costs combined are 15 percent, a much lower proportion than for many charities. Additional information about the United Way of Santa Cruz County is available <a href="http://www.unitedwaysc.org/">online.</a>
</p>
<p>
  Look for United Way materials, including a letter from Academic Senate chair Faye Crosby and the Staff Advisory Board, in your mailbox soon. The pledge deadline is November 14.
</p><strong>Requently asked questions</strong>
<p>
  <strong>Q: If I am already giving, and I don't want to make changes to my contribution, do I need to do anything?</strong>
</p>
<p>
  A: No, you do not. Your contribution will automatically continue.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Q: Does the United Way give to the Boy Scouts?</strong>
</p>
<p>
  A: No, the Santa Cruz County United Way does not. That organization was taken off the recipient list due to refusal to sign the nondiscrimination form required by the Santa Cruz County United Way. However, you can designate a donation specifically to the Boy Scouts or any other nonprofit organization by completing part C. on your pledge form.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Q: How do I know where my donation goes?</strong>
</p>
<p>
  A: All monies donated in Santa Cruz County stay in Santa Cruz County to support local agencies. Monies donated to the United Way general fund support the United Way sponsored agencies. You can direct your donation to a designated United Way agency or to any qualifying nonprofit organization.
