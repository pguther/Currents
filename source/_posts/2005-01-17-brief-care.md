Registration for summer- and fall-quarter child care is now under way at Child Care Services. Parents must fill out a one-page application to register.

It is expected that the programs for children ages 4 to 12 will have the most openings.   
  
Child Care Services has programs for children ages 3 months to 13 years. Details are available online at [www.housing.ucsc.edu/housing/child1.html][1].
