#### Electricity to be shut down on Saturday, September 2

Work crews will shut off electricity to selected areas of the campus on Saturday, September 2, from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. to perform work on the campus electrical system.

The areas that will be affected are: Earth and Marine Sciences, Kerr Hall, Theater Arts, Visual Arts, Hahn Student Services, the Music Center, the West Field House, Bay Tree Bookstore, Whole Earth Restaurant, Classroom Unit, the Farm, and College Eight, College Nine, and Cowell, Stevenson, Crown, Merrill, Oakes, Porter, and Kresge Colleges.

Staff and faculty working in these affected areas should shut down their computers before leaving for the weekend. The electrical testing is expected to create surges and sags in the campus energy distribution system that may harm computers that are left on. For more information, call (831) 459-4554 or 459-4444.
