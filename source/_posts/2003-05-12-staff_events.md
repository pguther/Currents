Chancellor Greenwood will hold two campuswide staff events next week, the staff forum on Monday, May 19, and the annual staff appreciation breakfast on Wednesday, May 21.

Greenwood will address a range of issues, including the budget, at her May 19 spring forum with staff from 12:30 to 1:40 p.m. at Earth & Marine Sciences Room B206. (Governor Davis is scheduled to unveil his May revision of the budget on May 14.)  

All staff members are also invited to attend "Pancakes and Jazz with M.R.C.," the annual free staff appreciation breakfast with the chancellor. The buffet-style breakfast will be served from 7:30 to 9:30 a.m. on May 21 at Stevenson Dining Hall.   

The Kevin Mitchel quartet, which played at the opening of the University Center, will perform.

Both events are sponsored by the Chancellor's Office and the Staff Advisory Board.
