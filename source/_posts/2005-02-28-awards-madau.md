The Alexander von Humboldt Foundation of Germany has selected Piero Madau, professor of astronomy and astrophysics, to receive a prestigious Humboldt Research Award. The Humboldt Research Awards are given to internationally recognized scholars outside Germany in honor of their lifetime achievements in research. Award winners are invited to carry out research projects of their own choice with colleagues at German research institutions.

Madau said he will use the award to conduct research in theoretical cosmology at the Max Planck Institute for Astrophysics in Garching, Germany. Madau's research addresses key events in the early evolution of the universe, including the dawn of galaxies, the formation and evolution of the first massive black holes, and the reionization and metal enrichment of the intergalactic medium. The detailed history of the universe during these early formative stages remains one of the crucial missing links in studies of galaxy formation and evolution.
