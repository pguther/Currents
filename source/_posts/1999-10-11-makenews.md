**Harry Noller**, Sinsheimer Professor of Molecular Biology, was interviewed on National Public Radio's _All Things Considered_ for a story about his laboratory's research on the structure of the ribosome [(NPR story][1]). The Noller lab's recent achievements were also covered in the _London Daily Telegraph,_ the _Santa Cruz County Sentinel,_ and other foreign and domestic newspapers; in various science magazines (_Science,_ _Chemical and Engineering News,_, and others); and on the Web at numerous science news sites.

Assistant professor of biology **Ingrid Parker** made an appearance on the KION _Morning Show_ to talk about the problem of invasive plant species. Parker, a plant ecologist, studies the spread of exotic species into natural areas.

**Anthony Pratkanis** of psychology was interviewed by _Details_ magazine about the effects of advertising clutter on persuasion.  
  
KION is also featuring professor of earth sciences **Karen McNally** in a series of reports leading up to the 10th anniversary of the Loma Prieta earthquake.

**Michael Brown** of politics did a live interview on KUSP Radio, discussing his new book _Race, Money, and the American Welfare State._

_California Wild,_ the magazine of the California Academy of Sciences, ran a feature story on the work of **Douglas Lin**, professor of astronomy and astrophysics and an expert on planet formation.

Literature's **Carla Freccero** has a new gig doing film reviews for KUSP, and  
among her first titles were films from the anthropology-sponsored Margaret  
Mead Film and Video Festival. Tune in Fridays at 3:55 p.m. and Saturdays at  
6 p.m.  
  
**Brian Walton**, coordinator of the Predatory Bird Research Group, was quoted in the _Riverside Press Enterprise_ in a story about the eagle population at Silverwood Lake.

During a summer visit to Australia, linguist **Geoffrey Pullum** was interviewed for two 15-minute nationally broadcast radio talks for ABC Radio National--one on why "bad" dialect doesn't make you a bad person but bad spelling does (at least if you're a sign-maker), and the other on what rule of word formation the Toni Braxton song _Un-break My Heart_ violates in lines like "un-cry these tears." Pullum has done six such radio talks in Australia now, all as part of a regular program called _Lingua Franca,_ which is devoted to language issues ([transcripts of the shows)][2].
