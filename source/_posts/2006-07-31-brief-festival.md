More than two dozen films by directors from the United States and abroad will be shown at the 13th annual Women of Color Film and Video Festival August 5-6 at Porter College.

The festival, the longest-running event of its kind, will also feature art, photography, and spoken and musical performances. It will take place from 5:30 to 10 p.m. on August 5 and 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. on August 6.

The festival is designed to serve as a place for participating artists, filmmakers, and community members to network and dialogue with women of color engaged in a diverse range of activist projects. It is organized by the Women of Color Research Cluster, a UCSC-based graduate student group committed to bridging the worlds of art, academia, and activism. Professor of History of Consciousness Angela Davis, the group's adviser, will deliver opening remarks.

This year's festival will be held in partnership with the [Mujeres Activas en Letras y Cambio Social Summer Institute][1] at UCSC. The institute is a national gathering of Chicana/Latina and Native American students, faculty, and activists.
