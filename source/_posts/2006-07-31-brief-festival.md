  More than two dozen films by directors from the United States and abroad will be shown at the 13th annual Women of Color Film and Video Festival August 5-6 at Porter College.
</p>
<p>
  The festival, the longest-running event of its kind, will also feature art, photography, and spoken and musical performances. It will take place from 5:30 to 10 p.m. on August 5 and 9 a.m. to 8 p.m. on August 6.
</p>
<p>
  The festival is designed to serve as a place for participating artists, filmmakers, and community members to network and dialogue with women of color engaged in a diverse range of activist projects. It is organized by the Women of Color Research Cluster, a UCSC-based graduate student group committed to bridging the worlds of art, academia, and activism. Professor of History of Consciousness Angela Davis, the group's adviser, will deliver opening remarks.
</p>
<p>
  This year's festival will be held in partnership with the <a href="http://www.malcs.net">Mujeres Activas en Letras y Cambio Social Summer Institute</a> at UCSC. The institute is a national gathering of Chicana/Latina and Native American students, faculty, and activists.
