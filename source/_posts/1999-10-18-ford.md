  Four graduate students at UCSC have received Ford Foundation fellowships totaling nearly $80,000. Luz Calvo, a graduate student studying history of consciousness, received a $21,500 "dissertation fellows" award. In addition, three other graduate students received $14,000 fellowships plus payment of academic fees--amounting to nearly $19,000 per student--as "predoctoral fellows." They are, with their areas of study: Maricela Correa, psychology; Jennifer N. Goodyear-Ka'Opua, history of consciousness; and Araceli Valle, psychology. The fellowships are administered by the National Research Council of the National Academies and are designed to increase the presence of underrepresented minorities on the nation's college and university faculties. The awards were presented earlier this month at the National Research Council's annual meeting in Washington, D.C. The four UCSC fellowships are among 117 nationally competitive grants the Ford Foundation awarded this year.
