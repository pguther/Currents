<p>
  A new vanpool is scheduled to begin serving the Monterey area on January 2. The vanpool, which will leave from Marina and make one stop in Moss Landing, will be UCSC's longest-distance commuting vanpool so far.
</p>
<p>
  The vehicle was purchased with grant funds received by the Monterey Bay Unified Air Pollution Control District. It will serve a 7 a.m. to 4 p.m. work schedule, leaving Marina at 6 a.m. The cost, paid through payroll deduction, is $50 a month. Back-up drivers--who receive a 25 percent discount on the fare--are being sought for the route.
</p>
<p>
  UCSC vanpools also serve Los Gatos, San Lorenzo Valley, Scotts Valley, Live Oak, Soquel, Aptos, and Watsonville.
</p>
<p>
  Seats are available in vanpools starting in Aptos (serving a work schedule of 7:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. and 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.), Soquel, and Watsonville. Most of the vanpools are seeking to add back-up drivers.
</p>
<p>
  Monthly vanpool fares range from $27 to $50 and include four parking passes a month plus eligibility for the Guaranteed Ride Home program.
