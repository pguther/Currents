Former UC Regent Ward Connerly and former California Supreme Court Justice Cruz Reynoso will take opposite sides in an affirmative action debate at 7 p.m. on Thursday, May 4, in the Colleges Nine and Ten Multipurpose Room.

Connerly, who has campaigned nationally against affirmative action, will take the opposing side, while Reynoso, a law professor at UC Davis, will speak in favor.

Also taking part in the debate will be UCLA law professor Richard Sander, an affirmative action opponent, and Faye Crosby, professor of psychology and chair of the UCSC Academic Senate. Crosby will be speaking in favor of affirmative action.   
  
The event is designed to provide a balanced forum for full discussion and debate about affirmative action in a facilitated debate format, and is part of the College Nine and College Ten cocurricular programs debate series.
