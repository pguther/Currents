Trustees from the UC Santa Cruz Foundation, including Vice President Anu Luther, Talat and Kamil Hasan, and Kiran Malhotra, were involved in planning a major tsunami relief event, [Bay Area Unites][1], that featured acclaimed author Deepak Chopra, Grammy-nominated Lisa Loeb, and a taped appearance from former President Bill Clinton.

UCSC was also one of the sponsors of the event, which took place February 20 at the HP Pavilion in San Jose and raised [more than $1.5 million][2] for relief efforts.
