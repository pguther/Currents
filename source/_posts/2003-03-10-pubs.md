New book offers resources for teaching organic gardening and farming skills

![][1]Over the past 35 years, instructors at UCSC have taught organic farming and gardening skills to more than a thousand apprentices through the UCSC Farm & Garden Apprenticeship Program. A new book published by the [Center for Agroecology & Sustainable Food Systems,][2] titled _Teaching Organic Farming & Gardening: Resources for Instructors,_ draws on that experience to offer teaching resources based on many of the skills and concepts taught during the six-month apprenticeship training program.  

The 600-page manual is designed for a wide audience of those involved in teaching farming and gardening. It covers practical aspects of organic farming and gardening, applied soil science, and social and environmental issues in agriculture. Units contain lecture outlines for instructors and detailed lecture outlines for students, field and laboratory demonstrations, assessment questions, and annotated resource lists. Although much of the material has been developed for field or garden demonstrations and skill building, most of the units can also be tailored to a classroom setting.  

The Center for Agroecology & Sustainable Food Systems web site provides a [detailed description][3] of the manual and information on [how it can be ordered][4].
