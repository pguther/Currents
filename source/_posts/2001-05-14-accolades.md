#### **Kevin Karplus, Wes Scott**

UCSC was represented twice among the winners of the [2001 Transportation Excellence Awards][1] from the Santa Cruz County Regional Transportation Commission (SCCRTC). Kevin Karplus, an associate professor of computer engineering, received a Lifetime Achievement award for his "long-standing commitment to improving bicycle transportation in Santa Cruz County." Wes Scott, director of Transportation and Parking Services, was recognized for "conceiving of and implementing the UCSC Bicycle Shuttle Program."  
  
The award citation for Karplus cites his lifelong personal commitment to alternative transportation and numerous contributions to improving bicycling for Santa Cruz county residents. Karplus recently retired from the SCCRTC's Bicycle Committee after serving for more than 15 years.   
  
The citation for Scott said, "Through his initiative in conceiving of and developing a 'bike shuttle' to UCSC, Wes Scott has single-handedly solved one of the most daunting challenges to UCSC bicycle commuters. He eliminated the hill climb that has dissuaded many would-be riders." The Bike Shuttle, started in spring 2000, now carries upwards of 100 bikes and their riders each day.
