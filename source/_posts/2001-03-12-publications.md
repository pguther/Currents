The Dickens Village collectibles are high-quality porcelein sculptures of churches, inns, houses, stores, and characteristically Victorian buildings, which are inspired by places and characters in the novels of Charles Dickens. The <i>Village Collector's Reader</i> provides an original Dickens description for more than a hundred of the Dickens Village pieces.
