#### Linda Rosewood Hooper

![][1]Linda Rosewood Hooper is the editor of a new book, [_The Village Collector's Reader: Selections from the Works of Charles Dickens_.][2] The book is an anthology of Dickens, compiled specifically for people who collect Department 56 Dickens Village. The Dickens Village collectibles are high-quality porcelein sculptures of churches, inns, houses, stores, and characteristically Victorian buildings, which are inspired by places and characters in the novels of Charles Dickens. The _Village Collector's Reader_ provides an original Dickens description for more than a hundred of the Dickens Village pieces.

UCSC owns a large Dickens Village collection, a gift from an anonymous donor to The Dickens Project. The collection is displayed at University House during the winter holiday season.
