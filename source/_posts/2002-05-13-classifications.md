If you've got questions about any aspect of job classifications at UCSC, you can now look for answers online, thanks to a new series of Classification Process [web pages][1] created by Staff Human Resources.

"Our overall objective in developing the web pages has been to demystify the classification process for campus employees, supervisors, and managers," said Willeen McQuitta, director of Staff Human Resources.  
  
McQuitta said the web pages evolved from a recommendation in the "[Classification Review Process Examination Project Report][2]" in May 2000, which cited feedback from employees and supervisors that there is a lack of information available about the classification process.  
  
Among the subjects covered on the web pages are [Why are jobs reclassified?][3], [How the decision is made,][4] and [Salary determination.][5]  
  
Also included is a new form, the [Classification Review Questionnaire.][1] "In an effort to expedite classification reviews, we are implementing this questionnaire with an eye to reducing the occurrence of time-consuming informational interviews, formerly known as desk audits," said McQuitta. She said her office will be assessing the questionnaire's viability and requesting feedback as it is used.  
  
McQuitta noted that information in the Classification Process web pages is general, and that those needing specific details should check the [Staff Human Resources Procedures Manual,][6] the personnel policies and collective bargaining agreements, or contact their service center or Staff Human Resources.  
  
McQuitta also emphasized, "We are trying to move our department toward a self-service organization where managers, staff, and faculty will have access to information, policies, procedures and other resources at their desktop. This is in line with the University's ['New Business Architecture'][7] framework. The Classification Process web pages are an example of the direction we want to go."
