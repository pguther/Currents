#### Child Care Services expands with new modulars

It wasn't just the children at Child Care Services who were excited to see big trucks at Koshland Way on April 27. Staff also turned gleeful at the sight of the trucks, which brought with them two new modulars. The modulars, which arrived in eight sections and were pieced together, will provide much needed space to expand the services of the Infant Toddler Program and replace a modular unit used by the School Age Program that burned down last spring. The new space should be ready for use in time for the program's summer session, which begins June 19.
