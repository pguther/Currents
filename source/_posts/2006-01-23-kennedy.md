Kennedy Jr.'s appearance underscores Arts &amp; Lectures' commitment to bringing some of the leading visionaries of our time to Santa Cruz," noted Michelle Witt, director of Arts &amp; Lectures. "His message is one of deep significance for the future of our natural environment, and, ultimately, for each one of us."
