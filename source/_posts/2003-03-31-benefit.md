The [Flying Karamazov Brothers][1] will give a special performance on April 12 to benefit [Shakespeare Santa Cruz][2]. The show will take place at the Rio Theater on Soquel Avenue in Santa Cruz at 8 p.m.  

Masters of juggling and cheap theatrics, the Flying Karamazov Brothers got their start on the streets of Santa Cruz in 1973.

Since then the Karamazovs have toured the world and have enjoyed six successful and critically acclaimed runs on Broadway. In 1987, for their third Broadway appearance, our hometown boys starred in their own adaptation of Shakespeare's_ Comedy of Errors_.

The Flying Karamazov Brothers have shared the stage with Robin Williams, the Blues Brothers, and the Grateful Dead. They have appeared on numerous television shows including an episode of _Seinfeld_ as the Flying Sando Brothers, as themselves on _Ellen,_ and on their own Showtime special.

Tickets for Gold Reserved Seats are $60 and nonreserved seats are $25. To purchase tickets, call (831) 459-2159.
