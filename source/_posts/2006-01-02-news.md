A request by **Chancellor Denice D. Denton** and **Campus Provost David S. Kliger** that federal elected officials investigate the alleged secret monitoring on college campuses, including a protest of military recruiters at UCSC last spring, was covered by numerous media outlets, including the _San Jose Mercury News_ and the _Santa Cruz Sentinel_. (A San Jose congresswoman, Rep. Zoe Lofgren, subsequently asked the inspector general of the Department of Defense to investigate whether the Pentagon overstepped legal bounds in gathering domestic intelligence and maintaining a database on U.S. residents.) The _Sentinel_ also featured **Chancellor Denton** in a year-end series the newspaper published on 2005 newsmakers.

A _New York Times_ travel story about Santa Cruz included plugs for the **UCSC Arboretum** ("glorious collection of gardens, which are a magnet for hummingbirds") and the **Seymour Marine Discovery Center** ("this superb small aquarium offers a peek at Monterey Bay's exotic animals").

Assistant professor of film and digital media **L. S. Kim** was quoted in a _Chicago Tribune_ article about how Hollywood films reinforce stereotypes of Asian women.

In an article in the _Lawrence Kansas Journal World_, sociologist **Craig Reinarman** said the disparity in penalties for those convicted of using crack cocaine and powder cocaine have more to do with racism than pharmacology.

New Teacher Center director **Ellen Moir** discussed the importance of mentoring and on-the-job training for new teachers in articles that appeared in the _Rochester Democrat_ and _Cincinnati Enquirer,_ among other newspapers.

Research on biochemical pathways involved in metabolism and body weight control from the lab of **Glenn Millhauser**, professor of chemistry and biochemistry, was covered in _Biotech Week, Life Science Weekly, Health & Medicine Week, Obesity & Diabetes Week_, and other weekly newsletters.
