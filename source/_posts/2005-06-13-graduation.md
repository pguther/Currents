Members of the Class of 2005 capped their campus careers with a weekend of commencements and celebrations beginning on Friday, June 10 , and culminating on Sunday, June 12.

Caps and gowns filled the campus as graduates of 10 colleges and the Jack Baskin School of Engineering made everything official.

Starting things off on Friday, June 10, was the Graduate Division commencement, with keynote speaker Chancellor Denice D. Denton.

The chancellor also addressed graduates at the College Ten and School of Engineering commencement exercises.

A total of 2,346 students were candidates for bachelor of arts, music, or science degrees. Also this spring, 215 students were eligible to receive master of arts or science degrees (of these students, 112 will complete UCSC's Department of Education master's program in late summer), and 61 students are candidates for doctorates. A small number of students will receive graduate certificates.   

Before the formal graduation, the spirit of celebration filled the campus, as a number of student groups--from student parents to African American students--were honored in a variety of ceremonies.
