Professor of economics Nirvikar Singh has received a prestigious 2005 IBM Faculty Award of $20,000. These awards are intended to recognize outstanding faculty and to promote innovative, collaborative research in disciplines of mutual interest to IBM and the researcher.

Singh's collaboration with IBM will focus on business transformation and the management of communication and change across organizational cultures. The goal is to generate insights that can improve the organizational architectures and business processes that govern information technology services engagements. In particular, experiments conducted at UCSC and IBM will seek to identify factors that enhance positive organizational change.

Singh is collaborating with economics professor Daniel Friedman and IBM researcher Paul Maglio to conduct these experiments. Subjects will be organized in teams, and the speed of accurate communication of technical information will be measured under different conditions, such as changing team composition, different background knowledge, and varied communication chain structures.

Singh is a first-time recipient of the award. IBM Faculty Awards are competitive awards that are renewable annually.
