  <a name="graffiti" id="graffiti"></a>Campus police ask for help in combating graffiti
</p>
<p>
  <img align="right" height="206" src="../art/graffiti_graphic.jpg" width="200" alt="">Graffiti has become an increasingly large problem on the UCSC campus.
</p>
<p>
  The financial costs and staff time devoted to the cleanup and removal of graffiti are significant. For the period from July 2001 to June 2002, the cost of graffiti cleanup on campus was about $30,700. This figure does not include the time that police officers spent investigating each incident. Nor does it take into consideration the chemicals staff are exposed to in removing the graffiti.
</p>
<p>
  In order to reduce the impact of graffiti on campus, the UCSC Police Department, the colleges, the Housing Office, and Physical Plant are asking for the assistance of all community members, including staff, faculty, and students.
</p>
<p>
  Wherever you see graffiti, whether on a garbage can, wall, poles, or signage around campus, pick up a phone and report it. You can make reports of vandalism to the campus Police Department at (831) 459-2231 or to the Work Order desk at Physical Plant at (831) 459-4444, 24 hours a day. Please give a detailed description and location of the graffiti so work crews can locate it. Also, if you see vandalism occurring, notify the Police Department immediately at the same phone number. By working together we can help to keep our community free of graffiti.<br>
