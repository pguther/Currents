The UCSC West Javanese Gamelan Ensemble will celebrate 25 years of performing West Javanese gamelan with a gala concert at 8 p.m. May 19 at the Music Center Recital Hall.

A gift of heirloom instruments from the Republic of Indonesia helped found the ensemble a quarter century ago.

Since then, UCSC lecturer in music and master drummer Undang Sumarna has been the principal creative force behind the popular ensemble, teaching the intricacies of the gamelan to countless students and community members.

Sumarna was honored this year with a** **Calabash Award from the Cultural Council of Santa Cruz County for his artistic excellence and contributions to cultural diversity in the arts.  
  
The Gamelan Ensemble is composed of UCSC students, faculty, and alumni. They have performed in many venues including the Olympic Arts Festival in Los Angeles, the International Wayang Festival in Indonesia, and on tour in West Java.  
  
The anniversary concert will feature traditional dance and music from both Hindu-Buddhist and Islamic cultures of Indonesia. In addition to the celebrated West Javanese Ensemble, UCSC's 10-year old Balinese Gamelan Angklung, directed by professor of music Linda Burman-Hall, will perform on the four-tone Balinese ensemble.  
  
Program highlights include:

* The premiere of Undang Sumarna's _Rampak Kendang,_ an intercultural drum jam for West Javanese gamelan containing African and Balinese elements;
* Music for American Balinese gamelan composed by Lou Harrison for Undang Sumarna and the UCSC gamelan;
* Contemporary gamelan-inspired works featuring performances by pianists Michael Rindt and Amy Beal, UCSC assistant professor of music.

Ticket prices are $8 general admission, $6 for seniors, and $4 for students. Audiences are invited to arrive anytime after 6:30 p.m. to enjoy preconcert music and anniversary festivities at the plaza outside the Music Center Recital Hall. For tickets and more information, call (831) 459-2159.
