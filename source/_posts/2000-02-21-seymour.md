  Faculty and staff are invited to "Leap on Down" to Long Marine Lab on February 29 between 11 a.m. and 3 p.m. for a special preview of the Seymour Marine Discovery Center. The public grand opening of the center will take place on March 11 and 12.
</p>The Seymour Center is a new public education center at Long Marine Lab, featuring galleries full of aquaria, exhibits, touch tanks, an 87-foot blue whale skeleton, a gift and book shop, and much more. Overlooking the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, this beautiful new facility offers visitors a unique view into the workings of a world-class marine research laboratory. Exhibits focus on the work of researchers in UCSC's Institute of Marine Sciences, which operates Long Marine Lab.<br>
<br>
Extra shuttle buses to Long Marine Lab will stop at all campus SC Metro stops every 20 minutes starting at 10:30 a.m.<br>
<br>
Memberships to the Friends of Long Marine Lab will be available at a 10% discount only during this preview event (regular memberships start at $20 students/seniors and $35 individual). Members can visit the center free all year long and will also receive an invitation to the members' opening event on March 5.
