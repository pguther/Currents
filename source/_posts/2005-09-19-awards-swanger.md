Professor Emeritus David Swanger has been awarded the 2005 John Ciardi Prize for Poetry by BkMk Press of the University of Missouri-Kansas City. He was selected from more than 400 entrants for his book of poetry, _Wayne's College of Beauty: New and Selected Poems_.

Prior to his retirement in July, Swanger was a professor of education and creative writing at UCSC, teaching educational philosophy for the Education Department and poetry classes for the Literature Department. He has written six books and two chapbooks.

BkMk Press founded the John Ciardi Prize for Poetry in 1998. The press publishes fine literature by contemporary authors. The judge, nationally known poet Colleen J. McElroy, is also a professor of English at the University of Washington and editor of the _Seattle Review_.
