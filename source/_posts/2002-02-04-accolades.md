</h3><a href="http://www.homestead.com/zootsuit/mccoy.html"><i>My Yiddishe Momme McCoy</i>,</a> a film by lecturer/staff member Bob Giges, will be showcased at the 12th San Diego Jewish Film Festival on Sunday, February 17. The 20-minute film, produced in 1991 at UCSC, was broadcast last year on <a href="http://www.uctv.tv/library.asp">University of California Television</a> and is now part of its video-on-demand collection.<br>
<br>
In <i>My Yiddishe Momme McCoy</i>, Giges provides an intimate portrait of his spirited 90-year-old grandmother, Belle Demner McCoy, and her struggle with the conflicts between family, religion, and love. Belle, raised an Orthodox Jew, was married for 50 years to Bernie McCoy, an Irish Catholic, who converted to Judaism. Through an interview with Belle, period photos, and Yiddish and American songs sung by Belle herself, the video offers a look at one person's attempt to reconcile tradition with assimilation.
