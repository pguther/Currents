</h3>
<p>
  The University Library will host a "Krispy Kreme Remembrance" in honor of Tom Ortiz, the head of the library's Operations Unit, who passed away on the night of May 1. The remembrance will be held on Thursday, May 23, in the McHenry Staff Room. All campus staff who knew Tom are welcome to come at 9 a.m. for refreshments and to share memories/anecdotes of Tom. To attend the event, come in the front door of McHenry Library. Staff will direct you to the Staff Room, which is on the ground floor and accessible through the east stairwell.
</p>
<p>
  The library is also preparing a bound memory book for Tom's family. Blank pages will be available at the event on May 23. The idea is to set down stories, e-mails, tales, remembrances, etc., of your time and dealings with Tom. There is no particular way to do this; the book can accommodate whatever people want to include. Pages for the memory book are also available in Library Operations; contact Eric Baker at (831) 459-4038.<br>
