From pressing issues of the day to age-old questions on the origins of the universe, the new Faculty Lecture Series at UCSC Extension in Silicon Valley is designed to enlighten, challenge, and inspire.

["The Milky Way, Schroedinger's Cat, and You," ][1]

["Huckleberry Finn in Our Times,"][2] is the topic on March 16, with professor of American Studies Forrest Robinson.

Professor of politics Ronnie Lipschutz will present ["Oil Eyes and Gas Gauges: The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly,"][3] on April 20.

["Offshoring of White-Collar Work: The End of High Tech as Job Creator?"][4] will be addressed by Lori Kletzer, chair of the UCSC Economics Department, in her May 18 lecture.

The lectures will take place at the UCSC Extension building at 10420 Bubb Road in Cupertino, and are sponsored by the Osher Llifelong Learning Institute at UCSC Extension. Admission is $30 per lecture or $100 for the series. Additional information is available [online][5].
