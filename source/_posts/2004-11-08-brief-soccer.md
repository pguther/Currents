The UCSC men's soccer team, with an 18-1 record this season and a No. 5 national ranking, will be hosting its first-ever NCAA playoff game this Saturday, November 13.

The game will be against West Region rival Redlands University (15-3-2), an NCAA finalist three years ago. The Slugs defeated Redlands earlier this season, in a very competitive 2-1 match.

The game begins at 1 p.m. on the Lower East Remote Field. Admissions is $6, adults; $3, students and seniors; and $1, children.
