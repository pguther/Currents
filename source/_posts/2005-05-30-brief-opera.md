  Don Juan, the legendary Spanish rogue and seducer, did get around in his day. Now the Don is coming to UCSC when the Music Department presents Mozart's Italian-language opera <i>Don Giovanni</i>, beginning on June 2 in the Music Center Recital Hall.
</p>
<p>
  Considered by many to be Mozart's finest opera, <i>Don Giovanni</i> is a successful combination of comic and dramatic opera. The work begins as Don Giovanni is leaving the bedroom of his latest conquest and ends with his descent into hell.
</p>
<p>
  <i>Don Giovanni</i> features the artistic efforts of an array of participants in addition to student performers: music lecturer Brian Staufenbiel directs; music professor Nicole Paiement conducts the UCSC Orchestra; lighting design is by Sylvie Vray; scenic design is by Legend Theatrical; costume design is by Marti Kranak; and wigs and makeup are by Jeanne Hurd. The opera will be sung in Italian with English supertitles.
</p>
<p>
  John Dizikes, professor emeritus and author of <i>Opera in America,</i> will present a preperformance talk before the final matinee performance on Sunday, June 5. The talk begins at 1:10 p.m. in the Music Center Recital Hall.
</p>
<p>
  <i>Don Giovanni</i> plays Thursday through Sunday, June 2-5 in the Music Center Recital Hall. Thursday, Friday, and Saturday performances are at 7:30 p.m.; Sunday's performance is at 2 p.m. Tickets are $18 general, $14 seniors, and $10 students. Seating is reserved. Tickets for the performance and the Dizikes talk are on sale at the UCSC Ticket Office (831) 459-2159.
