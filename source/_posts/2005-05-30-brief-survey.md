<p>
  Faculty, staff, and students who have used Service Centers within the past year are being asked to participate in a short <a href="http://survey.ucsc.edu/BAS/Service_Centers">online survey</a>. The survey will continue through June 24.
</p>
<p>
  Designed to assess customer satisfaction with the current Service Center system, the data will be used to help establish service levels and priorities for the newly reorganized Purchasing and Staff Human Resources Departments, as well as the new unit being established within Financial Affairs, called the Financial Administrative Services Transactions office (or FAST).
</p>
<p>
  The reorganization is part of the Business Transformation Program (BTP), the consolidation of business service functions currently performed by the 26 existing Service Centers into three organizations. Additional information on the reorganization is available from a new monthly newsletter, <i><a href="http://bas.ucsc.edu:16080/btp/bulletin.html">BPT Update</a></i><a href="http://bas.ucsc.edu:16080/btp/bulletin.html">,</a> which has been sent out to faculty and staff as well as being available online.
</p>
<p>
  Results of the survey will be posted on the <a href="http://bas.ucsc.edu/btp">BTP web site</a> the first week of July. For more information, contact Susan Willats (<a href="mailto:willats@ucsc.edu">willats@ucsc.edu</a>) at (831) 459-3759.
