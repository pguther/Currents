<p>
  Students will get a chance to learn what it's like to work with the UC Board of Regents when the current student Regent, Adam Rosenthal of UC Davis, and the student Regent-designate, Maria Ledesma of UCLA, visit UCSC on February 3.
</p>
<p>
  Rosenthal and Ledesma will meet with UCSC students at noon Friday at Bay Tree Conference Room D to encourage students to seek the position of student Regent.
</p>
<p>
  If a UCSC student becomes student Regent, it would be a first for the campus; no students from UCSC have served since the position was established in 1975.
</p>
<p>
  Career Center advisers and staff are available to review applicants' resumes and application materials, which include essays, and to discuss interviewing techniques. Career Center advisers are available during drop-in advising hours from 9:30 a.m.-11:10 a.m. Monday through Friday and 1:30-3:30 p.m., Monday through Thursday at 305 Bay Tree Building (the Career Center will be closed for Presidents' Day on February 20).
</p>
<p>
  The Career Center and Writing Program will also offer orientations and workshops to help applicants prepare their applications. An orientation will be held from 3:30 to 5 p.m. February 8, and an application review workshop will take place from 3:30 to 5 p.m. February 15, both at Bay Tree Conference Room A.
</p>
<p>
  Applicants will have a chance to meet with Chancellor Denice D. Denton about UC systemwide issues at 9:45 a.m. on February 22 in Room 212, Kerr Hall. (Interested students are being asked to RSVP to <a href="mailto:cyndi@ucsc.edu">cyndi@ucsc.edu</a> by February 8.)
