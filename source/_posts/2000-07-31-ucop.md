UC Office of the President

Tracy M. Davis, a Ph.D. student at UCLA whose passion is education and who thrives on community service, has been nominated as the next student member of the University of California's Board of Regents.  
  
Davis' nomination, recommended by the Regents' Special Committee to Select a Student Regent, will be considered by the full board at its September meeting. If approved, Davis will become student Regent-designate and be able to participate in all deliberations but not vote until July 2001, when her one-year term as student Regent begins. The current student Regent is another UCLA graduate student, Justin Fong.  
  
Davis, 27, who is pursuing a doctorate in higher education and organizational change, was on the fast track toward a production job in television when a chance presentation to a group of "at risk" students changed the direction of her life.  
  
"Educators help shape lives," she wrote in her application to become student Regent. "With education playing such an important role in the futures and livelihood of America's youth, I commit myself to stretching the limits of my potential as an educator and lifelong learner and enabling students to do the same."  
  
Davis, raised in Seal Beach, Calif., received her undergraduate degree in anthropology from UCLA. She received the Chancellor's Service Award at graduation. Before deciding to change her career path, she had worked as a researcher and coordinator for Cable News Network in Washington, D.C., and New York.  
  
Her current volunteer activities are linked to UCLA's Alumni Association and Graduate Student Association.  
  
In a paid position as coordinator of student programs at UCLA's undergraduate admissions, she supervises a staff of 40 students and a volunteer staff of 150 students. Since 1997, Davis has worked as an outreach and admissions officer on campus. She especially values her opportunity to work directly with students.  
  
At UCLA's Marine Aquatic Center, she serves as a sea kayaking instructor and outdoor adventure guide.  
  
If approved, Davis will be the 27th student Regent since the position was established in 1975.  
  
"This will be an exciting time to be a Regent in California," said Davis. "With the electronic generation at hand and the changing needs of our state, the next five to 10 years will be a crucial time for the UC system and education in general."
