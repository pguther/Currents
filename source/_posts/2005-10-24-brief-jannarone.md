Assistant professor of theater arts Kimberly Jannarone is working as both an actor and a dramaturg in Ted Hughes's version of _Alcestis_, an ancient Greek tragicomedy by Euripides that tells the tale of a woman who takes her husband's place when death comes for him.

The production is co-produced by Theater Emory, a professional theater company associated with Emory University, and Out of Hand Theater, a troupe that _American Theater_ magazine included in its recent article titled "Hot, Hip and on the Verge: A Dozen Young American Companies You Need to Know."

Jannarone is in residence at Emory this fall as part of a faculty exchange program with the Emory Classics Department.
