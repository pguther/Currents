  <a name="blumenthal" id="blumenthal"></a>Mark Cioc to direct UCSC's Washington Program
</p>
<p>
  History professor Mark Cioc has been named director of the UC Santa Cruz <a href="http://zzyx.ucsc.edu/Pol/ucdc/index.html">Washington Program</a>
</p>
<p>
  Cioc takes over from politics professor Daniel Wirls, who directed the program for six years.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The program provides work and internship opportunities in Washington, D.C., for UC students from the system's California campuses. UCSC sends approximately 20 students to the nation's capital each fall, winter, and spring quarter.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Operating out of the UC Washington Center, the program offers opportunities for participants to combine course work with field research and work experience in a variety of areas. Students divide their weekly schedules between classes and a part-time field placement position. They are registered as UCSC students and earn academic credit for the courses taken. All participants pay UCSC registration fees and remain eligible for financial aid if regular UCSC standards are met. The campus also sends a visiting faculty member and a graduate student each quarter to teach courses and provide teaching assistance, respectively.
