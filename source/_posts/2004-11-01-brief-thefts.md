  During the past week the campus has experienced several computer thefts from various locations around campus. In all cases, campus police report, that each area where the theft occurred was left unlocked and the property not secured.

<p>
  "It appears that the thief is working his/her way around the campus," cautioned Nancy Carroll, UCSC police sergeant. "This is a reminder that when you leave your office or classroom please <i>do not</i> leave your property unattended."
</p>
<p>
  If members of the campus community notice anyone suspicious in their work areas, they are asked to contact the University Police at 459-2345.
