College Eight's Sustainability Project won the Outstanding Project Award given by the American College Personnel Association at its annual conference in Orlando, Florida. This award recognizes exemplary cocurricular initiatives that significantly impact the educational experience of first-year students.

The Sustainability Project complements the core course, _Environment and Society_, by engaging each first-year student in a learning experience that directly connects the student to the environment. Students participated in community learning settings and reflected on those experiences in the core course.

Projects included:

**Waste Watchers**  
**Hidden Connections within Food Waste**  
**Harvest for Health**  
**Jump to the Dump**

The project was led by Heidi Lewin and Joy Pehlke, college program coordinators, in partnership with Tim Galarneau from the Student Environmental Center.
