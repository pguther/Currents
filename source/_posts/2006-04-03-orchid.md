UCSC Extension received top honors from the University Continuing Education Association (UCEA) in the organization's annual competition recognizing excellence in marketing and publications. Extension's _Art, Design and Humanities_ 2005-06 catalog series was a gold award (first place) winner. A Job Skills Ad also received the top award. A three-ad series for Business & Management, Engineering & Technology won a bronze award (third place).

Joan Boffa-Dentone is the art director in charge of design and production for the pieces. Robert Defreitas is the editor. The catalog is printed by American Lithographers in Hayward.

Other top universities in the competition included other UCs, University of Chicago, New York University, Indiana University, Rice University, University of Maryland, University of Washington, among others.

The awards will be presented at a special ceremony at the UCEA annual meeting in San Diego April 11.
