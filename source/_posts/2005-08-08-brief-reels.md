The Radical Reels Film Festival comes to Santa Cruz next month with an inspiring collection of high-adrenaline films. The event, which will benefit the UCSC Recreation Outings Scholarship Program, will take place on Saturday, September 24, beginning at 7 p.m. at the Rio Threatre.

The Radical Reels screenings incorporate elements of the Banff Mountain Film Festival World Tour, but focus on dynamic, high-adrenaline films featuring sports such as skiing, climbing, kayaking, BASE Jumping, snowboarding, and mountain biking. A total of nine films will be shown.

Advanced tickets are available at the UCSC Recreation Office for $8/students, $10/general. Tickets will be available at the Rio Threatre, the evening of the show for $10 student and $12 general.

For more information, call the Recreation Office at 459-2806.
