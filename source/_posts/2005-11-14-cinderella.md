  Shakespeare Santa Cruz celebrates the holiday season with a return of its acclaimed musical version of <i>Cinderella</i> November 18 through December 18 at the UCSC Theater Arts Mainstage
</p>
<p>
  <i>Cinderella: A New Telling of an Old Tale</i> was created for Shakespeare Santa Cruz by Paul Whitworth and Kate Hawley, with music composed and arranged by Gregg Coffin. The show opened to rave reviews in its 1999 world premiere and sold out again in 2000.
</p>
<p>
  Whitworth, artistic director of Shakespeare Santa Cruz and director of <i>Cinderella</i>, is well known to audiences in the Bay Area and beyond for his work as both an actor and director. Hawley, playwright and lyricist for the production, also wrote the enormously popular holiday shows <i>Gretel and Hansel</i> and <i>The Princess and the Pea.</i>
</p>
<p>
  This creative version of the beloved fairy tale features extravagantly outlandish costumes by B. Modern, exuberant choreography by Terry Barto, and spectacular sets by Dipu Gupta. Director Whitworth promises that all the colorful characters will be back: Cinderella, Prince Charming, Little Bo Peep and her very naughty sheep, along with the Ugly Stepsisters (Regan and Goneril) and Cinderella's astonishingly awful Stepmother, Mrs. Baden-Rotten.
</p>
<p>
  The story of Cinderella has been a treasured folktale for many years; over 300 versions had been collected from all over the world by 1893, including one published in 1697. It also has long been a favorite subject for "pantomime," a form of theater unique to England that employs humor and music to tell a traditional fairy tale. Shakespeare Santa Cruz's <i>Cinderella</i> blends English pantomime with the American musical to create a charmingly unique entertainment.
</p>
<p>
  The <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i> noted that the company's <i>Cinderella</i> "hits the sweet spot that's so often missed in family shows. Intelligent and buoyant, lyrical and silly, it plays to real people instead of an age-targeted, holiday-market demographic." The <i>San Jose Mercury News</i> added: "Shakespeare Santa Cruz proved that intelligence is not <i>verboten</i> in the usually saccharine world of holiday entertainment with its wittily interactive <i>Cinderella</i>."
</p>
<p>
  The November 18 special preview price is $18. Tickets for all other shows are $18/$14 for children age 12 and younger, $26/$21 for seniors/students/UCSC staff, and $32/$27 for the general public.
