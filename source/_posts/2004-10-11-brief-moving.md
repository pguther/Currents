Fall has been moving time for the Economics Department and the Education Department.

Social Sciences 1 is the new home for the Education Department. The department's new mail stop is now titled "Education." All phone numbers and e-mail addresses will remain the same. Directory information is available online at [www.education.ucsc.edu][1]

The move of the Economics Department to the new Engineering 2 Building will be celebrated with a wine reception at 5 p.m. on Friday, October 15, in the new building. The department's mail stop and phone numbers are unchanged.
