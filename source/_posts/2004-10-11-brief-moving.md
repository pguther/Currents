  Fall has been moving time for the Economics Department and the Education Department.

<p>
  Social Sciences 1 is the new home for the Education Department. The department's new mail stop is now titled "Education." All phone numbers and e-mail addresses will remain the same. Directory information is available online at <a href="http://www.education.ucsc.edu/">www.education.ucsc.edu</a>

  The move of the Economics Department to the new Engineering 2 Building will be celebrated with a wine reception at 5 p.m. on Friday, October 15, in the new building. The department's mail stop and phone numbers are unchanged.
