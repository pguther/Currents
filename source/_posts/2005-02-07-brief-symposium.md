Faculty and staff from a variety of disciplines will offer ideas for engaging students at the first annual Teaching and Learning Symposium on Thursday, February 17, from 1 to 5 p.m. at the University Center.

The event, titled "Engaging Students: Challenges & Solutions for Small & Large Classes," will include faculty presentations, instructional technology demonstrations, and exhibits. The afternoon will conclude with a panel discussion, titled "Technology, Student Engagement, and Learning: Are we going in the right direction?" Faculty are invited to attend all or part of the event.  

The symposium, formerly known as the Convocation on Teaching, is presented by the Committee on Teaching, the Center for Teaching Excellence, Media Services, and the Information Technology Services Division.
