**Arts & Lectures'** presentation of Wynton Marsalis and the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra was covered locally--in the _Santa Cruz County Sentinel,_ regionally--in the _San Jose Mercury News,_ and nationally--in the _New York Times._ The _Times_ article noted that sunbathers on Cowell Beach (below the WestCoast Santa Cruz Hotel where the band stayed) got a pleasant earful when some band members stepped out onto their balconies and jammed before the show. UC Santa Cruz Foundation trustee **Yolanda Dybdahl** was quoted for the story.

The _Miami Herald_ led an in-depth story about changes in Latin American studies with a quote from **Jonathan Fox** of our own LALS program.

Physics professor **Zack Schlesinger** penned an op-ed about narrative evaluations for the _San Jose Mercury News._ **Manuel Pastor** appeared on the same pages discussing the origins of the digital divide, which he believes is rooted in "the divide in the digital economy."

The _Sacramento Bee_ publicized the new California State Summer School in Mathematics and Science, dubbed **COSMOS**, in its pages recently. The four-week program caters to the interests of the state's top high school students in math and science.

**Lora Lee Martin,** director of the Monterey Bay Education, Science and Technology (MBEST) Center, was quoted in an article in the _Monterey County Herald_ about recent progress in developing UCSC's site on the former Fort Ord military base. A new road and infrastructure now under construction will soon open up 67 acres for development at the research and technology center, and construction of the UC MBEST Center headquarters and small-business incubator building is scheduled to begin this summer.  
  
A review of the IMAX movie _Dolphins_ in the _Monterey County Herald_ quoted **Alejandro Acevedo-Gutierrez,** a postdoctoral researcher in the Institute of Marine Sciences, and also mentioned professor of biology **Terrie Williams** and dolphin trainer **Billy Hurley**, all of whom are featured in the film.
