Eleven students have been selected to receive the 2005 William Hyde Irwin and Susan Benteen Irwin Scholarships, given annually by the Art Department to outstanding young artists at UCSC.

The students selected this year are Blake Anderson, Nora Aoyagi, Kelly Lee Barrett, Gordon Combs, T. Garrett Eaton, Nate Goodman, Rebecca Hartman, Rebecca Souza, Phoenix, Fletcher Tucker, and Josh Yoches.

The Irwin Scholars will exhibit their work at the Mary Porter Sesnon Art Gallery from May 19 through June 11. An opening reception is scheduled for Thursday, May 19, from 5 to 7 p.m. and will include an awards ceremony. The exhibition and reception are both free and open to the public.

The Irwin Scholarship Fund was established in 1986 and the awards are considered recognition by the art faculty to students in the top 5 percent of the program. The Sesnon Art Gallery's annual exhibition will feature this year's recipients working in painting, photography, printmaking, sculpture, installation, and electronic media.

Gallery hours are Tuesday through Saturday, from noon to 5 p.m. Parking is free on Saturdays. Group tours are available by appointment at (831) 459-3606. For more information, call Leslie Fellows at (831) 459-5667 or go to the [Sesnon Gallery][1] web site.
