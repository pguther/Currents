  The London train bombings have prompted concerns about UCSC students participating in the Education Abroad Program (EAP) in the United Kingdom.
</p>
<p>
  UCSC has 26 students participating in EAP programs in England this summer: 17 students at Sussex International Summer School, and nine at Pembroke Summer School in Cambridge.
</p>
<p>
  All students at Pembroke and Sussex have been accounted for. Pembroke has set up several telephone lines that can be used by parents to telephone in to their students:<br>
</p>
<p>
  011 +44 1223 764567<br>
  011 +44 1223 764568<br>
  011 +44 1223 764569<br>
  011 +44 1223 764570
</p>
<p>
  All London Study Center staff and directors, including new director Michael Cowan and retired EAP adviser Byron Wheeler, are accounted for and safe. The two had just arrived in London from Santa Cruz so that Cowan can begin his duties as the new director.

<p>
  Inquiries regarding American citizens who may have been in the United Kingdom at the time of the incidents should be directed to the United States Department of State Office of Overseas Citizen Services at 1-888-407-4747.
