Eight faculty members have received 2003-04 Excellence in Teaching Awards from the Academic Senate Committee on Teaching.   

Given each spring, the awards honor those who have demonstrated exemplary and inspiring teaching.  
  
Nominations are submitted by students, and the committee also reads a statement on teaching written by the nominee, as well as a letter from the department chair. The committee looks for evidence that the nominee has thought deeply about teaching and learning, and effectively applies that thinking in the classroom.  

This year's awards were presented by Acting Chancellor Martin M. Chemers and Committee on Teaching Chair Judith Habicht-Mauche on May 28 at University House. The names of recipients were announced during the final Academic Senate meeting of 2004 on May 21. The awards include $500 in cash for faculty members and $200 for graduate students.   

The winners, followed by the text on their certificates, are:  

**Manuel Ares Jr., molecular, cell, and developmental biology,** "for commitment and innovation in teaching biology, for involving students in the excitement of research, for encouraging them to learn not only the known, but also the unknown."  

**Gildas Hamel, languages,** "for inspiring and creative teaching of languages, for a lively and engaging classroom where all actively participate in learning, for enthusiasm, breadth of knowledge, and dedication to students."  

**Kevin Karplus, biomolecular engineering,** "for innovation in teaching computer engineering and biomolecular engineering, for challenging problems, question-driven lectures, and enthusiasm for the subject, for high standards and dedication to student success."  

**Jenny Keller, science communication,** "for extraordinary teaching of science illustration, for creating a collaborative classroom where students learn from one another, for offering discipline, mentorship, insight, and encouragement."

In addition to the faculty awards, 10 graduate students at UCSC have received the Outstanding Teaching Assistant Award. Award-winners are nominated by faculty members and selected by the Graduate Council
