Appointments

Provosts for 2004-05 announced at five colleges

College Eight: Lecturer **Roz Spafford** has been appointed as provost of College Eight. Spafford, a lecturer with security of employment (SOE), graduated from Merrill College in 1971, majoring in community studies and having done fieldwork with the United Farm Workers. After graduate work at San Francisco State University in creative writing, she returned to the campus as a faculty member in 1978. She has taught in the Writing Program ever since, serving as its chair from 2001 to the present.   

Cowell College: In an entirely new situation for UCSC, associate professors of literature **Ty Miller** and **Deanna Shemek** have been appointed as coprovosts of Cowell College starting in January 2005. After teaching at Yale University, Shemek came to UCSC in 1990. She has received a variety of prestigious awards in recent years, including the American Council of Learned Societies Fellowship in 1995 and the Harvard Villa I Tatti Fellowship in 2001. Miller came to UCSC from Yale in 1999, and was director of the UC Education Abroad Program in Budapest, Hungary, from 2001 to 2004. In addition to these scholarly distinctions, both have been very active in Cowell College since arriving on campus.

Until January 2005, the provost of Cowell College will continue to be professor of chemistry emeritus **Stanley Williamson,** who has served as provost for the last academic year.

Crown College: Professor of computer engineering **F. Joel Ferguson** is returning for a second term as provost. Ferguson was one of the primary authors on the proposal to integrate the college core courses and the campus composition requirements. His primary focus during his next term will be to increase the involvement of faculty in the college.  

Kresge College: Having previously served as provost of Kresge College from 1996 to 2001, professor of literature **Paul Skenazy** will return to the college for a second stint as its provost. He has taught at UCSC since 1971, and his scholarly work ranges in subject from popular culture to ethnic literature. During his earlier provostship, Skenazy established a center for transfer students that was the first of its kind in the UC system.

Porter College: Provost **David Evan Jones** has been reappointed to another three-year term at Porter College. During his first term as provost, Jones launched several initiatives, including a gospel choir course, a course in queer studies, a community-service course taught by dancer/choreographer Tandy Beal, a Research Assistant Program for Porter students, and the George Hitchcock Poetry Fund. In his second term, Jones hopes to collaborate with the Division of Arts in creating a nationally visible Festival of Digital Arts/New Media at UCSC.
