A mountain lion was seen last week near UCSC's Long Marine Laboratory, serving as a reminder that the UCSC campus is situated in mountain lion habitat, and the big cats are occasionally sighted on campus.

Mountain lion safety tips are available here: [www2.ucsc.edu/police/liondoc1.html][1]

Additional information about California mountain lions is available from the state Department of Fish and Game at: [www.dfg.ca.gov/lion/index.html][2]

The mountain lion seen last week was observed outside the National Marine Fisheries Service Santa Cruz Laboratory (NOAA Fisheries). Witnesses included a group of about 30 people taking part in a seminar.
