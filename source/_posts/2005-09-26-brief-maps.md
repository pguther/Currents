The large four-color map of the UCSC campus has just been reprinted; both poster and folded versions are available for purchase at the Bay Tree Bookstore ($7.99 and $4.95, respectively). While the map artwork is updated regularly for the [campus map web site][1], reprinting happens only every other year.

New maps have been delivered throughout the campus over the past two weeks to get them posted as widely as possible. "We used to simply place them in the bookstore, and ask people to go buy them," says Susan Willats, manager of the campus map project. "It was efficient, but not very effective." The new maps are also being placed in campus transit shelters.

The poster-size map artwork was created in 1999 by a professional cartographer, using existing maps and aerial photos. Since then, Willats has coordinated the regular updating of the large map, close-up maps of the colleges, one-page navigational maps to common destinations on the campus, and the map web site.

The artwork is maintained by Helen Cole of Graphic Services; funding is provided by the Business and Administrative Services Division. For more information, or to request a map for posting, contact Susan Willats at [willats@ucsc.edu][2] or (831) 459-3759.
