  Start your holiday feasting early and support a great cause on Tuesday, November 13. Chefs Robert Morris of Blacks Beach Cafe and Heidi Schlecht and Amy Linstrom of Feel Good Foods organic seasonal catering are hosting a five-course dinner to benefit the Friends of the UCSC Farm &amp; Garden.
</p>
<p>
  Wine to accompany each course is being donated by Bonny Doon
</p>Vineyard.<br>
<br>
The fall affair will take place at Morris's restaurant at 15th Avenue and East Cliff Drive in Santa Cruz, beginning with hors' d'oeuvres at 6:30 p.m. and dinner at 7 p.m. The cost, including wine, is $70 per person.
<p>
  Reservations are required. For more information please call Joan Tannheimer at the UCSC Farm at (831) 459-3240, or make your reservation directly with the restaurant at (831) 475-2233. Vegetarian options are available.<br>
  <br>
  Donors contributing to the dinner include Bonny Doon Vineyard, Country Meadow Australian Lamb, Dirty Girl Farm, Happy Boy Farms, Molino Creek Farming Collective, New Leaf Community Markets, Stagnaro's, and the UCSC Farm.<br>
  <br>
  Bonny Doon Vineyard is well known for its unique and winsome approach to winemaking, naming, and label design. The dinner will feature five of Bonny Doon Vineyard's wines, including California Syrah, one of the most recent additions to its offerings.<br>
  <br>
  Funds raised at the dinner support the efforts of the Friends of<br>
  the UCSC Farm &amp; Garden, which promotes the work of UCSC's Center for Agroecology &amp; Sustainable Food Systems. Through community education, including a series of organic gardening talks and workshops, Friends' members help spread the word about the need for farming and gardening systems that are environmentally and socially sound. The Friends also raise funds for the Apprenticeship in Ecological Horticulture, a six-month, hands-on training course during which participants learn the basics of organic farming and gardening.<br>
