  <font color="#003399">Spring is a perfect time for a Farm tour</font>
</h4>On a clear day, you can see forever. Well, okay, maybe only across the bay to Monterey, but the views from the UCSC Farm are pretty spectacular, and spring is a perfect time to visit. Free one-hour tours of the Farm are offered twice weekly beginning March 23 and continuing through October.
<p>
  Docents share organic gardening tips with visitors as they lead walks through the Farm's lush gardens, busy greenhouses, productive orchards, and fields of row crops. Visitors have the opportunity to learn about growing flowers, fruits, and vegetables organically, as well as about composting, propagation, and the university's research in sustainable agriculture.
</p>
<p>
  Tours take place on Thursdays at noon and Sundays at 2 p.m. and begin at the Louise Cain Gatehouse. Free parking is available on weekends in the Physical Plant parking lot. For more information about tours, call (831) 459-3240.
