#### Work-Life Balance series continues

Two sessions are offered: one from 12:15 to 1:15 p.m. and a second from 1:30 to 2:30 p.m. Light refreshments will be served; participants are encouraged to bring their lunches. The workshop is free, but reservations are required. To reserve a spot, e-mail workshop@cats.ucsc.edu.

#### Spring is a perfect time for a Farm tour

On a clear day, you can see forever. Well, okay, maybe only across the bay to Monterey, but the views from the UCSC Farm are pretty spectacular, and spring is a perfect time to visit. Free one-hour tours of the Farm are offered twice weekly beginning March 23 and continuing through October.

Docents share organic gardening tips with visitors as they lead walks through the Farm's lush gardens, busy greenhouses, productive orchards, and fields of row crops. Visitors have the opportunity to learn about growing flowers, fruits, and vegetables organically, as well as about composting, propagation, and the university's research in sustainable agriculture.

Tours take place on Thursdays at noon and Sundays at 2 p.m. and begin at the Louise Cain Gatehouse. Free parking is available on weekends in the Physical Plant parking lot. For more information about tours, call (831) 459-3240.

#### Awards for outstanding student employees

Each year the campus Career Center recognizes student employees for exceptional performance and/or contributions to the campus administration. Top student employees receive a minimum cash award of $100 (maximum $2,000), a certificate of appreciation, and an official public recognition of their excellent service to the university. See a full description of the [Student Employee Recognition Award Program][2]. To nominate a student employee, supervisors fill in the [nomination form][3] and send it to their Service Center; Service Centers must submit the form to Patti Parise at the Bay Tree Bookstore by March 31. Further details and Service Center deadlines may be obtained from the individual Service Centers.
