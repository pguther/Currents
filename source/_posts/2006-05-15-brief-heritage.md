Human rights activist Yuri Kochiyama will speak about her book, _Passing It On: A Memoir,_ at the University of California, Santa Cruz, at 2 p.m. on Wednesday, May 17, at the Merrill Provost House.

The book reception event celebrates and honors Kochiyama's extraordinary life and accomplishments. Her memoir coincides well with UCSC's Asian American/Pacific Islander Heritage Month theme, "Preparing Today for Tomorrow: Momentum for Movements." (See earlier [Currents story.][1]) The event is free and open to the public.  
  
Later in the month, traditional and contemporary cultural identities will be highlighted through music, poetry, dance, theater, and food. The Cultural Showcase will take place from 6 to 8 p.m. on Wednesday, May 31, at the College Nine/College Ten Multipurpose Room.
