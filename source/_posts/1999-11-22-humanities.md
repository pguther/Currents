Art professor Frank Galuszka will present a talk titled "Painting, Myth, and Multiversa." The talk, which is free and open to the public, takes place on Thursday, December 9, from 7 to 8 p.m. at the McPherson Center for Art and History, 705 Front St. A reception follows.<br>
<br>
A critically acclaimed painter, Galuszka has been featured in nearly two dozen solo exhibits, more than 70 group exhibitions, and is included in a number of public and corporate collections.
<p>
  His recent work involves second order cybernetics--a field exploring the meaning of cognition, communication, and organization in human, artificial, and natural systems.<br>
  <br>
  The talk is presented as part of the Humanities Lecture Series, sponsored jointly by the Humanities Division and the Art Museum of Santa Cruz County. The series runs through June on the second Thursday of each month. For more information, call (831) 459-2696 or (831) 429-1964.<br>
