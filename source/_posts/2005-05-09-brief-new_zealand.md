On Sunday, May 15, the Arboretum at UCSC will host "New Zealand Day," a festival of music, arts, and culture, from 1 to 9 p.m. A wide variety of activities will take place in the Ed Landels New Zealand Garden in the Arboretum, which has the largest collection of New Zealand plants outside of that country.

The event will feature a full program of performances, exhibitions, and lectures. Visitors will be able to hear installations of New Zealand music as well as recordings of New Zealand bird songs. Performances will range from indigenous music to modern electroacoustic, accompanied by video works.

Guest artists will include Richard Nunns, who will perform on Moari instruments and also demonstrate ways in which native plants can be used as musical instruments, as well as for food and medicine. Performances will also be given by the Waiata Choir, the New Music Works ensemble conducted by Phil Collins, Hera Black-Taute, and Mareta Taute.

**Schedule:**   
1-3:30 p.m. Lecture and garden tours by the Arboretum's curator of New Zealand plants. Recorded New Zealand birdsongs playing in the garden.

3:30 p.m. Traditional singing welcome ceremony, followed by opening remarks by Chancellor Denice D. Denton and New Zealand Honorary Consul Richard Collier Sears.

4-5:30 p.m. Music in the amphitheater, including the world premiere of _Waiata Wahine_ by Jack Body.

6-8 p.m. Interlude: Food and tours. Opening of the traditional earthen oven (Hangi), sampling of New Zealand wines, tours, and ongoing music. Food and wine will be available for purchase.

7 and 8 p.m. Two performances of _Confronting Landscapes/Inscapes,_ which is made up of video and electroacoustic music by New Zealand composers.

The festival is made possible by the volunteers of New Music Works and the Arboretum. The event is free due to the generosity of the Christensen Fund and sponsorships from New Leaf Community Markets and the New Zealand consulate.
