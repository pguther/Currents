The third annual Honored Faculty, Honored Books Program this week will celebrate the bond between the written word and the achievement of scholars.

Sponsored by the UCSC Libraries, the Jack Baskin School of Engineering, and the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences, the program honors both faculty achievements and the books scholars select as having most influenced them as a scientist and educator.   

The campus community is invited to attend a ceremony and reception in the Science & Engineering Library at 2:30 p.m. on Thursday, November 13, to celebrate the honored faculty and their selected books.  

Each honored book is added to the library collection and inscribed with a personalized bookplate in honor of the scholar who selected it.

The library maintains a commemorative [web site][1] that showcases the titles faculty have selected along with their descriptions of the significance of the books to their lives and careers.   

The Honored Faculty, Honored Books Program recognizes the achievements of science and engineering faculty who have attained tenure or promotion. The reception will include remarks from Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood, Campus Provost John Simpson, Engineering Dean Steve Kang, and Dean of Physical and Biological Sciences David Kliger.
