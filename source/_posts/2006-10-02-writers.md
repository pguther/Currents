<p>
  The Humanities Division's Living Writers Series kicks off this fall quarter on October 4 with a presentation by poet Joshua Clover, a widely published critic and journalist, a frequent contributor to the <i>New York Times</i>, and the poetry editor for the <i>Village Voice Literary Supplement</i>.
</p>
<p>
  Clover is one of many authors and poets who will appear at UCSC this academic year as part of the annual series coordinated by associate professors of literature Micah Perks and Karen Yamashita--codirectors of the UCSC Creative Writing Program. The presentations are sponsored by the campus's Institute for Humanities Research, Porter College Hitchcock Poetry Fund, and the Literature Department.
</p>
<p>
  "The series this fall is particularly exciting because we have several alumni reading--Cole Swensen, winner of a Guggenheim; Heather Nagami, a just-published poet; and Noria Jablonski, who recently published her first book of short stories," said Perks. "Another writer I'm really excited about is Kate Moses, who wrote the prize-winning, beautiful, and disturbing book, <i>Wintering,</i> about Sylvia Plath. We have a great mix of both established and young writers."
</p>
<p>
  All of the readings will take place on Wednesday evenings from 7 to 8:30 p.m. at the Kresge College Town Hall, Room 466. Admission is free and open to the public.
</p>
<p>
  "As always, UCSC's Bay Tree Bookstore will be selling the authors' books at a discount at the readings," Perks added. "They have been wonderful partners in this series."
</p>
<p>
  Clover's work has been anthologized in <i>American Poets in the 21st Century</i> and <i>American Poetry: Next Generation</i>, and his poems have been chosen three times for inclusion in the annual <i>Best American Poetry</i> series. The author of two poetry books, <i>The Totality for Kids</i>, and <i>Madonna anno domini</i>--which earned him the 1996 Walt Whitman Award--Clover is also the recipient of two Pushcart Prizes and a fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts.
