Foley lectured on southeast Asian puppetry to open the show. The exhibit will travel next to the East-West Center Gallery in Honolulu, where it will be on view from January through March and Foley will perform and lecture on Southeast Asian puppetry. Foley edited an issue of Asian Theatre Journal. on puppetry of this area to coincide with the show.

</h4>
<p>
  The Santa Cruz Lifelong Learners, a group of 200 local retirees, donated $4,000 for 20 special $200 book scholarships for UCSC students. The funds help re-entry students pay for expensive textbooks.<br>
  <br>
  At their annual holiday lunch in December, the Lifelong Learners had six of the award winners as guests--students who have spent some years working before going back to college. Scholarship Committee chair Matt Miller said in announcing the winners, "It is heartening for us to get the responses and comments from these motivated students. Seeing, hearing, and meeting them makes the whole program worthwhile and come alive."<br>
  <br>
  The UCSC book support program is one of many activities of the Lifelong Learners. They have special-interest groups in art and architecture, boating, creative writing, film discussion, financial investment, hiking, international affairs, and play reading. The Lifelong Learners also have general meetings, usually with a lecturer from the faculty, on the third Sunday of each month, on campus. Annual dues are $30. There are no age restrictions and no academic prerequisites. For more information on programs or membership, call (831) 459-2552.<br>
