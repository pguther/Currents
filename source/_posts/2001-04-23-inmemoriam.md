  <b>William Blankenbeckler,</b> who retired in September 2000 from his position as swing-shift senior custodial supervisor in Physical Plant, died April 7; he was 55.

<p>
  Mr. Blankenbeckler was born in Bakersfield and lived in Aptos for 33 years. He began working for UCSC in 1972 as part of the maintenance crew at Crown College. In 1976 he joined the staff of Physical Plant (called Campus Facilities then) and was a custodian for Kresge College for many years. After several promotions, in 1985 he became a supervisor for Custodial Services, a position he held until illness forced him to take medical leave just months after receiving his 25-year service award.
