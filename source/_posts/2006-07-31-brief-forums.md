  The Humphrey Fellows, now studying in UCSC Extension's English Language and International Programs Department, are from Africa, South America, Central Europe, Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East.

  They will speak as panelists at the 6 to 8 p.m. forum at the Louden Nelson Community Center's Room 3, 301 Center Street, Santa Cruz. Subjects will include HIV/AIDS prevention, human trafficking, drug abuse prevention, child health care, human rights, and the use of media to promote democracy. Humphrey Fellows' areas of expertise include public health, human rights, law, environmental studies, communications, and economics.

  Hubert H. Humphrey Fellows are career professionals who have been awarded scholarships from the U.S. State Department and Department of Education to study in the United States for one year. They receive an intensive, three-week course in American academia through UCSC Extension before moving on to campuses throughout the United States.
