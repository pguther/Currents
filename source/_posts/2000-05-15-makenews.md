History of consciousness's **Angela Davis** coauthored an in-depth article on prison conditions for the Opinion pages of the _Sunday Examiner & Chronicle._ Her piece focused on security housing units--cells that put prisoners in solitary confinement--and was coupled with another by C.A. "Cal" Terhune, director of the California Department of Corrections.

For a review of the IMAX movie _Dolphins,_ the _Santa Cruz County Sentinel_ interviewed **Alejandro Acevedo-Gutierrez,** a postdoctoral researcher in the Institute of Marine Sciences whose work with dusky dolphins in Patagonia was featured in the film.  
  
Professor of earth sciences **Robert Anderson** and graduate student **Lesley  
Perg** were featured in a pair of articles in the _Salinas Californian_ about Perg's research on the rate of uplift of the marine terraces along the Santa Cruz coast.

**College Nine** made a media splash last week, receiving coverage on KCBS and KLIV radio, in the _San Jose Mercury News,_ on Bay City News Service, and on KSBW-Channel 8.

The _Santa Cruz County Sentinel_ recently ran a story about librarian **Margaret Gordon**, noting that her name will soon be known by millions of romance novel fans thanks to a dedication in the _New York Times_ bestseller novel _The Wicked Widow._

"Tomfoolery," a musical review of more than 20 of mathematician **Tom Lehrer's** satirical songs, is playing in Walnut Creek and getting rave reviews from critics at regional papers, including the _San Francisco Chronicle._ At the same time, a new three-CD box set titled _The Remains of Tom Lehrer_ is due out this month. That release, which features such all time favorites as "Poisoning Pigeons," was featured in the _Santa Cruz CountySentinel._
