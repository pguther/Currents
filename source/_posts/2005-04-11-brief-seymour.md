For the third year in a row, the Surf Industry Manufacturers Association (SIMA) will provide a grant to support education programs at UCSC's Seymour Marine Discovery Center. The Seymour Center is one of 10 environmental organizations chosen by SIMA to receive proceeds from the Waterman's Weekend, the surf industry's annual environmental fundraiser.

The SIMA Environmental Fund provides grants to environmental organizations based on their commitment to specific projects that will protect and preserve oceans, beaches, or surf breaks. The Seymour Center will use the funds from SIMA to educate young people about the role marine science plays in understanding and conserving the world's oceans.

The exact amount of the grant depends on the funds raised during the Waterman's Weekend. Last year, the Seymour Center received over $12,000 from the SIMA Environmental Fund.

The annual Waterman's Weekend serves as the primary fundraiser for the SIMA Environmental Fund through the Waterman's Classic Golf Tournament and Waterman's Ball and Auction. This year's Waterman's Classic will take place August 26 at the Monarch Beach Golf Links. The Waterman's Ball and Auction will be held August 27 at the St. Regis Monarch Beach Resort & Spa in Dana Point, California.
