The Friends of the UCSC Library and the UCSC Dickens Project will present the annual Dickens Holiday Evening on Friday, December 3, from 4:30 to 6 p.m. at UCSC's McHenry Library Foyer. Admission is free and everyone is welcome.

Join in the fun at this annual festive evening featuring the ever-popular Robert Fenwick who will perform Victorian music and song, read from _A Christmas Carol,_ and lead the traditional sing-along caroling.

Enjoy a delicious array of Victorian holiday treats, including cookies, gingerbread, mincemeat pies, and hot apple cider, and win fun raffle prizes. A wonderful holiday event for the whole family.

The Friends of the UCSC Library will present the Dickens Project with its annual gift for the library, which this year is a 12-volume CD set entitled _The Letters of Charles Dickens._
