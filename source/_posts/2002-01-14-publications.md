### Elisabeth Cameron

![][1]Elisabeth Cameron, assistant professor of art, has just published a new book, _Art of the Lega._ The book accompanies an exhibition, ["Art of the Lega: Meaning and Metaphor in Central Africa,"][2] on display at UCLA's Fowler Museum of Cultural History through March 10. The show was curated by Cameron, a specialist in central African arts.  
  
The objects in the exhibit comprise one of the world's most comprehensive collections of Lega art. The exhibit highlights the role the arts play in Lega society and their importance to the Lega people of the Democratic Republic of the Congo. For more information on the exhibit, go to the [museum newsletter.][3]
