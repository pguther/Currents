  McHenry Library research specialist Joanne Nelson has been named Volunteer of the Year by the Santa Cruz Museum of Art &amp; History. Nelson served as the history docent liaison to the museum's Volunteer Council in 2001. She also served as council vice-chair in 2004 and was elected chairperson that same year.

  Nelson has assisted at countless museum programs and events, and she was recently appointed to the position of research assistant for the museum's archives. She can be found every Tuesday cataloging history books in the archives, saving the museum thousands of dollars in professional fees.

  "At MAH, volunteering gives me a link to the past and to future generations," said Nelson. "As a volunteer, I recognize that I can achieve much more together with others than on my own."
</p>
<p>
  Nelson has worked at McHenry Library since 1989.
