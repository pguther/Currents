<font color="#003399"><b>Kimberly Jannarone<br></b></font>Assistant Professor, Theater Arts<br>
<br>
Kimberly M. Jannarone joins the faculty to teach directing and dramaturgy. She is currently directing students in the annual Shakespeare To Go production, for which Jannarone condensed <i>The Merry Wives of Windsor</i> into a 50-minute play.<br>
<br>
Jannarone received her B.A. from Emory University, and a Master and Doctor of Fine Arts from the Yale School of Drama. Her dissertation, "The Avant-Garde Impulse: The (Para-) Theatrical Legacies of Alfred Jarry and Antonin Artaud," considers French avant-garde theater from the perspective of two playwrights at either end of the chronological period.
