**Kimberly Jannarone  
**Assistant Professor, Theater Arts  
  
Kimberly M. Jannarone joins the faculty to teach directing and dramaturgy. She is currently directing students in the annual Shakespeare To Go production, for which Jannarone condensed _The Merry Wives of Windsor_ into a 50-minute play.  
  
Jannarone received her B.A. from Emory University, and a Master and Doctor of Fine Arts from the Yale School of Drama. Her dissertation, "The Avant-Garde Impulse: The (Para-) Theatrical Legacies of Alfred Jarry and Antonin Artaud," considers French avant-garde theater from the perspective of two playwrights at either end of the chronological period.
