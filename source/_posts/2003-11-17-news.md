UCSC in the News

The _Los Angeles Times Book Review_ called the new book _Changing the Powers that Be_ by psychology's Bill Domhoff "a startlingly fresh analysis" by an author who has "a bracingly firm grasp on the realities of the political world."

Writing in _The Nation_, columnist Patricia Williams offered high praise for _Whitewashing Race: The Myth of a Color-Blind Society_, authored by a team of seven that included **David Wellman** of community studies and **Michael Brown** of politics. Williams called the book "a definitive treatise" and an "extraordinarily in-depth study."

The _Sacramento Bee_ featured an interview with American studies professor **Tricia Rose** about her new book _Longing To Tell._ The _San Diego Union-Tribune_ also ran a profile of Rose that was recently published in the _New York Times._

Sociologist **Hiroshi Fukurai**'s op-ed about juror diversity appeared in the _San Francisco Chronicle._

**Manuel Pastor** of Latin American and Latino studies was cited in a _Los Angeles Times_ article about the challenges facing Latinos trying to achieve the American Dream in Los Angeles. Pastor wrote the summary of the United Way report.
