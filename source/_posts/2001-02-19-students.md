<p>
  Each spring, alumni from UC's nine campuses meet with state lawmakers in Sacramento as part of the annual UC Day legislative conference.<br>
  <br>
</p>At this year's conference, scheduled to take place March 5-6, two UCSC students will be honored for work they submitted for the UC Research Poster Competition.
<p>
  Gitane Royce, with the abstract "Responses of the Native California Shrub <i>Purshia tridentata</i> to Global Climate Change," and Sarah Simons, with the abstract "The Cinema of Julio Medem," will travel to Sacramento to be recognized at the UCSC alumni reception and dinner that will take place during UC Day activities. Michael Loik and Frank (Paco) Ramirez, the faculty mentors of Royce and Simons, will also be recognized at the reception.
</p>
<p>
  The conference, sponsored by the Alumni Associations of the University of California (AAUC), focuses on the importance of state support for the mission and programs of the University of California. The theme of the 2001 UC Day is "On the Threshold of Opportunity."
</p>
<p>
  Last year, the AAUC decided to offer undergraduates the opportunity to participate in the conference. "The research of the UC faculty and alumni is key to the work and reputation of the university," said Lynda Goff, UCSC vice provost and dean of undergraduate education. "The AAUC recognized the need for undergraduates to have the opportunity to present their research as well. Now it has become a standard part of the meeting."
</p>
<p>
  Here's how the competition works: Each of the eight general UC campuses nominates four undergraduate students for their work in the research of any field; of these four, the Office of Research from UC's Office of the President chooses two or three per campus to attend the conference and display a poster illustrating the research conducted.
</p>
<p>
  Royce, with her abstract focusing on the impact of climate change on a widely distributed native California shrub, is a senior from Charlemont, Mass., majoring in biology.
</p>
<p>
  Royce's faculty mentor, Loik, is a research scientist for the Environmental Studies Department. Royce said her experience in Loik's lab has been an integral part in shaping her future research interests. "Dr. Loik has been a true mentor during all phases of my research," said Royce.
</p>
<p>
  Simons, with her research into the work of Spanish director and screenwriter Julio Medem, is a senior majoring in language studies. She is currently in Spain continuing her research and preparing for an interview with Medem.
</p>
<p>
  Simons also attributes much of her success in her research to her faculty mentor. "My mentor, Paco Ramirez, has been a constant source of encouragement throughout this entire project," said Simons. "Really, it was his faith in me that has led me to develop this project beyond just a thesis." Ramirez is a lecturer of Spanish for the Language Studies Program.
</p>
<p>
  Each award winner will display a poster illustrating the research conducted and have an opportunity to discuss that research with alumni, legislators, and policy makers at UC Day. After the conference, the posters will be displayed at the UC Office of the President in Oakland.
