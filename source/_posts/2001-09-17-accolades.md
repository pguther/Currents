#### John Brown Childs

John Brown Childs, professor of sociology, addressed the Conference on Small Arms session of the United Nations in July. Childs discussed urban gang violence and constructive grassroots peacemaking efforts by community organizations in the United States. Among the work he discussed were the efforts of groups such as Barrios Unidos in Santa Cruz, Milagros in Watsonville, and Stop the Violence/Institute the Peace in Inglewood.

Childs was invited to the United Nations as a partner in an international research team examining grassroots peacemaking in violent regions around the world. Organized by the Maryknoll Society, the partnership includes members from Northern Ireland, Sri Lanka, the Philippines, Southern Sudan, Guatemala, and Rwanda. Childs's essay, "Places of Sense/Senses of Place: Peacemaking and the Positive Cultures Movement in U.S. Cities," will be published in the forthcoming book "Community Responses to Violence," from Orbis Press in 2002. Childs's own book on cooperation and peacemaking, entitled "Transcommunality: From the Politics of Conversion to the Ethics of Respect," is forthcoming from Temple University Press in 2002.
