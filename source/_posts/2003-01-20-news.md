UCSC in the News

Linguistics professor **Geoffrey Pullum** was coauthor of a full-page opinion piece in the January 3 issue of the_ Chronicle of Higher Education._ Pullum, along with Rodney Huddleston of the University of Queensland, Australia, argue that college curriculums need to include courses on English grammar that are based more on syntactic analysis and less on outdated and oversimplified usage rules.

**Patrick Letellier,** an instructor at Merrill College, published the cover story in the January 9 Santa Cruz County _Good Times_. The story, called "Beyond He and She: A Transgender News Profile," is an analysis of transgender rights cases from around the country.

The _Los Angeles Times_ reported the $1 million donation of photographs from renowned photographer Pirkle Jones and his late wife, Ruth-Marion Baruch, to the UCSC Library's Special Collections.

The _Santa Cruz Sentinel_ and the _Good Times_ both ran feature stories on the new children's book, _Sally Slug,_ written by UCSC Foundation trustees **Anne Neufeld Levin** and **Patricia Rebele.**  

The _Santa Cruz Sentinel_ ran a two-page article and photo spread on the new book of photographs, _Santa Cruz, California,_ by UCSC librarians **Sheila O'Hare** and **Irene Berry.**  

KSCO covered the art exhibition, Faculty Works: 2003, at the Sesnon Gallery featuring works by new UCSC art faculty **Melissa Gwyn, Lewis Watts,** and **Elliot Anderson**.
