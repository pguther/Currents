The Arboretum begins a second season of the Third Thursday Music Series on May 18 with a performance by the Joe Craven Trio. The concert starts at 6:30 p.m. at the Dean McHenry Amphitheater on the grounds of the Arboretum.

Joe Craven wears many hats and plays many things. For almost 17 years, he was the highly respected multi-instrumentalist with the David Grisman Quintet. He has played with Jerry Garcia, Stephane Grappelli, Ramblin' Jack Elliott, Psychograss, Darol Anger, Ken Nordine, and many others. Craven's recently released album _Django Latino_, which showcases melodies by two of the most significant musicians of 20th-century string jazz within a landscape of cumbia, merengue, samba, tango, and Latin jazz, is getting rave reviews.

Other performers in the series include Ulali on June 15, Tish Hinojosa on July 20, and Sista Monica on August 17. Check the [Arboretum][1] web site for schedules, ticket sales, and concert information.

Tickets available in advance at Norrie's Gift Shop at the Arboretum, open 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. daily; Logos Bookstore in downtown Santa Cruz, open 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily; and also at the door, if tickets remain on day of show.
