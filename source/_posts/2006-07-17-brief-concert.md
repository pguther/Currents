The Tish Hinojosa Trio will perform on the Amphitheater Stage at the Arboretum on Thursday, July 20. Doors open at 5:30 p.m. and the show begins at 6:30 p.m. The concert is the third in the Arboretum's [Third Thursday Music Series][1].

Tish Hinojosa has become one of the most acclaimed artists in the contemporary Latin and folk scene. With a purity of voice she embraces pop, rock, Tejano, and international styles.

Born in San Antonio, the daughter of Mexican immigrants, Tish Hinojosa developed a borderless approach to music, incorporating elements of Mexican folk and country with contemporary pop and rock. Her 1989 debut album, _Homeland,_ immediately put her on the international musical map. With her next release, _Culture Swing_, Hinojosa won the NAIRD Award for Best Folk Album. Over the eleven subsequent releases, countless tours of North and South America and Europe, Hinojosa developed a loyal audience. Her music and social activism on behalf of children, Latinas, and farm workers have won her numerous awards. In her latest release,_ Heart Wide Open_, she continues to express her distinctive musical styles and background.

Other performers in the concert series include Sista Monica on August 17, Toshi Reagon on September 21, and The Lalo Guerrero Tribute Concert on October 19. Check the [Arboretum][2] web site for schedules, ticket sales, and concert information.
