In 1979, the UCSC Chautauqua Festival made its debut at the Barn Theater, just inside the main entrance of the fledgling 14-year-old campus.   

Modeled after a tradition of theater festivals that began at Lake Chautauqua, New York, more than a century ago, the annual campus event has now helped teach students how to produce, direct, write, and star in dramatic productions for two and a half decades.   

The UCSC Theater Arts Department will celebrate a significant milestone this year when it presents the 25th annual Chautauqua Festival, beginning on Thursday, May 13, and running for two weeks at the campus Theater Arts Center. All performances are free and open to the public.  

"To me, it's the truest training ground for the future of theater that we can provide," noted Gregory Fritsch, a lecturer in theater arts who has overseen numerous presentations of Chautauqua since his first foray as festival director back in 1989. "It presents a practical and successful model of mentoring fellow artists and provides a comprehensive training arena for all aspects of theater--design, directing, playwriting, acting."   

Perhaps the greatest asset of Chautauqua is that it provides a showcase for new dramatic writing. The festival offers students a remarkable chance to have their own original plays developed and produced under the direction of other students.   

"It provides our students with opportunities that exist in very few undergraduate programs in the country, and serves as an incentive for students hungry to get their work out in front of an audience," observed award-winning playwright and UCSC theater arts professor James Bierman.   

Bierman noted that four students who have had work produced in the Chautauqua Festival have gone on to win the prestigious Nicholl Fellowship of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, "making UCSC the most successful producer of dramatic writers of any university program in the country in the academy's eyes," he added.  

The original Chautauqua Festival worked from eight scripts that were created by students in Bierman's 1979 theater arts playwriting workshop.   

"The first evening began with a real tour-de-force production of a two-minute piece that featured an actor in a hazardous materials suit who cut down a potted geranium with a chainsaw," Bierman recalled. "That was the shortest piece on the program. The longest was a one-hour-and-twenty-minute drama by a gifted student named Philip Heim, who went on to direct in New York City."   
  
During the 1980s, the festival evolved and expanded in various experimental directions, adding short dance pieces and student films, and increasing the number of dramatic productions. One year, the festival closed with a 13-hour marathon that began on Sunday at noon and ended at 2 a.m. "It was amazing how many students endured the whole thing in one sitting," said Bierman.   

Today, nearly 150 students devote themselves each year to running the festival, spending vast quantities of time covering all aspects of theater production. Bierman said that in recent years, the festival has become more disciplined than it was in the past, noting that the quality of the productions has increased measurably despite limited financial resources.   

This year's festival will feature 12 original scripts, ranging from a stage adaptation of George Orwell's _1984 _to a production combining African folklore and modern puppetry.
