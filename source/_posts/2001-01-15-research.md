Students receive Friends of Long Marine Lab research awards

By [Tim Stephens][1]  
  
The Friends of Long Marine Lab Student Research Awards will support 14 student research projects in the current academic year. The projects cover a broad range of topics, from the movements of great white sharks to the reproductive ecology of mussels.   
  
A total of $9,400 was awarded to two undergraduates and 12 graduate students. The Friends of LML Awards come from the interest generated by six different endowments: The Jane McHenry Student Awards Fund, the Lillian McPherson Rouse Student Award Fund, the William Baye Heald Scholarship Fund, the Friends of LML Student Support Fund, the Mark T. MacMillan Memorial Prize Fund, and the Ken Norris Marine Mammal Research Award.  
  
An awards ceremony and reception will be held at the Seymour Marine Discovery Center on Friday, January 19, at 4 P.M.  
  
Individual awards are listed below:

* Arnold Ammann, graduate student, Biology: "Understanding the Mechanisms of Dispersal in bocaccio _(Sebastes paucispinus)_ and cabezon _(Scorpaenichthys marmoratus)_ using Otolith Micro Chemical Analysis of Newly Settled Juveniles"
