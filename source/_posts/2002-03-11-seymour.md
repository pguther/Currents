If you're wondering what to do with your little darlin's during spring break, look no further than the Seymour Marine Discovery Center, where educators have added new programs and activities for the weeks of March 23-April 7.

Keep the kids from bouncing off the walls by enrolling them in fun workshops such as "An ROV For Me," in which participants ages 9 and up will build their own remotely operated vehicle.

Or plan your activities around "Seaside Storytime," a story hour offered on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday mornings.

If you prefer a more spontaneous approach to school break, take note of the "See More" lab activities, offered five times daily, in which kids can dress up as Rocky the Sea Lion, play Marine Mammal Jeopardy, explore the world of sea otter feeding, or compare the abilities of scuba divers and gold-medal swimmers to extraordinary "Dolphin Olympians."

Most activities, including arts and crafts projects, are covered by the cost of admission to the Seymour Marine Discovery Center. Admission fees and a full schedule of activities are listed below. Space for the ROV workshop is limited, and advance registration is required. For more information, call (831) 459-3800, or visit the [web site][1].

"We've beefed up our regular programs to give kids--and parents--a lot of options," said Lisa Borok, visitor programs manager at the Seymour Center.

Spring break programming begins Saturday, March 23. The Seymour Center is open Tuesday-Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. The center will be closed Easter Sunday, March 31, and is always closed on Mondays. Admission is $5 for adults; $3 for children ages 6-16, students, and seniors age 60 and over; children ages 5 and under are free. The first Tuesday of each month is free admission, and members of the Friends of Long Marine Lab visit free every day.

Regular highlights of the Seymour Center include a hands-on seawater table, scavenger hunt, exhibits, the 87-foot-long blue whale skeleton, and daily tours led by knowledgeable docents. The Seymour Center is in Santa Cruz at the end of Delaware Avenue past Natural Bridges State Beach.
