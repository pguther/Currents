  <a href="http://united-way.ucsc.edu">United Way</a> contributors have a special opportunity this year to go "above and beyond" in their generosity.
</p>
<p>
  The campuswide United Way campaign, Oct. 18-29, is encouraging donors to pledge an additional amount to United Way this year, and designate it for the Homeless Services Center. The center needs to raise $340,000 more by the end of the year to qualify for Kresge Foundation matching funds and complete its capital campaign.
</p>
<p>
  <img align="right" height="115" src="../art/united_way.GIF" width="144" alt="">Overall, the United Way campaign has a goal of increasing contributions by 10 percent. In the past five years, UCSC employees have contributed more than half a million dollars to the community through United Way.
</p>
<p>
  "Our participation in the United Way campaign is critical to the preservation of the Community Fund," wrote Academic Senate chair Alison Galloway and Staff Advisory Board chair Patt Takeuchi in a letter to the campus community.
