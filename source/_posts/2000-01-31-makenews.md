Professor emeritus of astronomy and astrophysics **Donald Osterbrock** was mentioned in the _New York Times_ for his leading role on a panel of astronomers who chose the most important papers of the 20th century for a centennial issue of _The Astrophysical Journal _and _The Astronomical Journal._

UCSC Foundation Trustee **Hal Hyde** was profiled in the _Mid-County Post,_ which chose him as the paper's 1999 Man of the Year. The article credited Hyde with being "one of the architects of education in the county" and described his 40-plus years of advocacy on behalf of Cabrillo College and UCSC, as well as his work helping immigrant children complete high school and go on to higher education.

Sociologist **Dane Archer **made the _Santa Cruz County Sentinel's_ story about local residents who were members of the same Yale University fraternity as presidential candidate George W. Bush.  
  
Research by **Lisa Sloan** and **James Zachos,** both associate professors of earth sciences, was the subject of an article in the _Dallas Morning News._ The story described findings by Sloan, Zachos, and others regarding a period 55 million years ago when global warming caused temperatures to soar and dramatically affected life on earth.

Television stations KCBA, KION, and KSMS were eager to cover the **New Teacher Center's** symposium on teacher quality in Monterey last week.
