The Eighth Annual International Economics Conference will take place October 14-15 at the University Center. The event is sponsored each year by UCSC's Santa Cruz Center for International Economics (SCCIE) to facilitate the exchange of ideas and the presentation of new research.

With participants from the International Monetary Fund, the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, UCSC, UCLA, UC Berkeley, MIT, University of Chicago, and other universities, the conference will highlight topics such as "Social Security and Democracy," "Global Capital Flows and National Policy Choices," and "Trade Costs, Pricing to Market, and International Relative Prices."

A full conference schedule is available [online][1].

"This promises to be an informative and stimulating conference," said Joshua Aizenman, UCSC economics professor and SCCIE director.
