UCSC has been recognized as one of the 20 best campuses in the nation for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender students by _The Advocate College Guide for LGBT Students_.

UCSC's positive environment, programs and services and LGB T student coalitions were cited for the distinction. The campus guide highlights the 100 most LGBT-friendly campuses in the United States and lists the "Best of the Best Top 20" for rising above expectations as pioneering LGBT leaders in higher education.

"We are extremely honored that our campus was selected and recognized as a 'best of the best' LGBT-friendly campus," said Deb Abbott, director of UCSC's Lionel Cantu GLBTI Resource Center. "Our resource center staff, student leaders, campus staff and faculty as well as dedicated alumni have worked hard to create a positive environment for all of our students and this distinction emphasizes the importance of providing necessary support to meet all students' needs--including LGBT students."

The national organization [Campus PrideNet][1] and the national Consortium of Directors of LGBT Resources in Higher Education developed the criteria and a questionnaire for nominations
