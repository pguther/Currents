  The Second Annual KZSC Laugh Riot is bringing world-class comedy to Santa Cruz on Saturday, May 14, at 7 p.m. in the Kresge Town Hall.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The show will feature a broad spectrum of comedy from stand-up to music to sketch to film. The event, which is presented by KZSC, The Sound of Young America, and the SF Sketchfest, is a benefit for KZSC community radio. Tickets are $9 door/$8 in advance and students.<br>
  <br>
  Featured acts include:<br>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Hard N Phirm</b><br>
</p><i>Singled Out, Shipmates</i><i>Jimmy Kimmel Live</i><br>
<p>
  <b>Jasper Redd</b><br>
  In the past two years, Jasper Redd has earned a reputation as San Francisco's funniest young stand-up. The 25-year-old Tennessee native has traveled from janitorial roots to a full-time career on stage. He was recently featured on Comedy Central's <i>Premium Blend</i>, and his unique style has been featured at all three of the now-legendary 826 Valencia comedy benefits alongside performers like Greg Proops, Zach Galifianakis, Patton Oswalt, and Al Madrigal.<br>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Prank the Dean</b><br>
  Fifteen months ago, Prank the Dean were four disaffected Santa Cruz youths, most likely headed to juvenile delinquency and a life of petty crime. Today, they're the Bay Area's hottest new sketch comedy group. How did they do it? Hard work, discipline, and respect for their elders. Today they're proud to have been featured at the 2005 SF Sketchfest, where they were called "delightfully hilarious" by Pat Craig of the <i>Contra Costa Times</i>, and "hilarious from the start" by the <i>Stanford Daily</i>.<br>
</p>
<p>
  <b>Brent Weinbach</b><br>
</p><br>
<p>
  and your host... <b>Jordan Morris</b><br>
  UCSC graduate Jordan Morris has made his name by writing the kind of surprising, left-field jokes that are heard all too rarely in traditional comedy clubs. He's performed at clubs and alternative comedy rooms across the Southland, and is making his Bay Area debut.<br>
