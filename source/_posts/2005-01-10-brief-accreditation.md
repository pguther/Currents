<p>
  Counseling and Psychological Services (CPS) has received provisional accreditation from the Virginia-based International Association of Counseling Services, Inc. (IACS).
</p>
<p>
  Provisional accreditation precedes full accreditation, which is expected by June 2007, according to Max Camarillo, director of CPS, which provides services at the Cowell Student Health Center, the colleges, and Family Student Housing.
</p>
<p>
  "We began preparing for this more than two years ago and are very gratified by the outcome," said Camarillo. "Accreditation is the seal of approval that our services meet high professional standards as a comprehensive university counseling service, and we look forward to receiving full accreditation."
</p>
<p>
  IACS accreditation is available for university and college counseling centers and public and private counseling agencies in the United States and internationally.
</p>
<p>
  To become accredited, a counseling service must meet established standards and be evaluated by an outside board. The process involves an onsite evaluation. Accredited programs are reevaluated every four years, with a mandatory onsite evaluation every eight years. Annual written reports must be submitted during the intervening years.
