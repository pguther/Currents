In order to inform members of the UCSC community of the impacts of construction on campus, _Currents_ is now posting monthly updates on any construction projects that affect transportation and parking. In addition, this update includes information on the Mission Street widening project, due to start in March.

### Interdisciplinary Sciences Building

Expect traffic delays on **Steinhart Way**, the service road to the Science Library, Earth and Marine Sciences, and Natural Sciences 2. The loading dock to Natural Sciences 2 will be closed. Pedestrian paths will be rerouted along the construction site, and the pedestrian bridge to the Cowell Health Center will be closed. Construction will continue through fall 2001.

### Core West Parking Structure

Materials and concrete delivery trucks will travel up **Heller Drive**, turn right onto **McLaughlin Drive**, and right onto **Steinhart Way**. Expect traffic delays on these roads in the project area probably through the summer.  
  
**Parking Lot 114** in front of Thimann Labs and across from the parking structure is available only to cars with A and B parking permits. Parking permits are enforced 24 hours every day.

**Parking Lots 112 and 113** by Sinsheimer Labs and McLaughlin Drive are permanently closed.   
  
In order to compensate for these lost parking spaces, the **North Remote Parking Lot** is now reserved for cars with A and B parking permits and is no longer available for remote parking permits. **New shuttle service** between the North Remote Parking Lot and Science Hill is now offered. The Day East Remote Core route serves these areas every 15 minutes between 7:30 a.m. and 6 p.m. weekdays. The Express Night Core route provides drop-off service to the North Remote Lot weeknights after 6 p.m. [New maps and schedules][1] are available at the TAPS Web site.

### Bay Tree Bookstore expansion and Graduate Commons

There will be occasional traffic delays due to construction vehicles in the immediate area. Expect construction noise. The short section of **Hagar Drive** between Steinhart Way and McLaughlin Drive continues to be a one-way street. This project will continue through summer 2000.

### College Nine Apartments

**Parking Lot 164** across from the Village and close to Social Sciences 2 is available only to cars with A and B parking permits. Parking permits are enforced 24 hours every day.

### Mission Street Widening

The first major stage of construction on **Mission Street from Chestnut Street to Otis Street and possibly to Rigg Street** is slated to begin in March and continue through October. Northbound underground work, consisting of drainage, water, and sewer work, will occur through July.   
  
The city of Santa Cruz has opened a public information center to answer questions, troubleshoot problems, and provide general information, assistance, and referrals. For more information about the project and to get up-to-date 24-hour information, visit the [Mission Street Widening Project Web site][2] or call (831) 420-6242. Opinions, concerns, and questions can be e-mailed to mspac@cruzio.com.  
  
To obtain information regarding bus schedules and disruptions at planned bus stops, please call the Santa Cruz Metropolitan Transit District at (831) 425-8600.
