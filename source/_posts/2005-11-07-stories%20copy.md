  The David and Lucile Packard Foundation has awarded a major grant to researchers at UCSC and other institutions to study fisheries in the northern Gulf of California.
</p>
<p>
  The $1.3 million grant funds a collaborative project to help local Mexican fishers and government officials understand and manage marine resources using cutting-edge fisheries science.
</p>
<p>
  The project is an interdisciplinary effort that will combine social science, fisheries science, and outreach programs to promote the sustainability of fisheries in the Gulf of California. Peter Raimondi, professor and chair of ecology and evolutionary biology, will lead UCSC's participation in the project, along with Giacomo Bernardi and Mark Carr, both associate professors of ecology and evolutionary biology. The project also involves researchers at the University of Arizona and three Mexican institutifin Foundation, of which about $7 million will go to UCSC).
