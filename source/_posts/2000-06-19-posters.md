Sea otters, semiconductors, climate change, and clock genes were among the topics of research posters presented by UCSC undergraduates at the third annual Undergraduate Research Poster Symposium on Thursday, June 1. About 35 students in the Division of Natural Sciences and the Jack Baskin School of Engineering presented their research at the symposium, held in the Thimann courtyard.

"The undergraduate research experience provides students the rare opportunity to engage in supervised research and learn in a dynamic environment of discovery from professors who are leaders in their fields," said dean of natural sciences David Kliger.   
  
"We are extremely proud of the student participants and the scholarly work they have undertaken," Kliger said.  
  
The poster symposium provides students with the experience of presenting their research results in a professional setting. The event was one of many activities held on campus during Student Achievement Week.
