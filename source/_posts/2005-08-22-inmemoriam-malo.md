  Brian Malo, a reprographic technician at XpressIt! - Digital Copy Services died July 31 at his home in Capitola after fighting cancer for more than two years. He was 53 years old.
</p>
<p>
  "Brian worked with us since 2002; he was a wonderful employee and a great friend," said Geene Harbison, his supervisor. "He was a kind and gentle man that would do anything he could for you if and when you needed help."
</p>
<p>
  A great storyteller, Malo loved to joke around, and had a gift for drawing cartoon characters that made everybody's day. He loved being outdoors, either river rafting or hiking, and he especially loved being on the beach making his famous sand castles. He played the guitar and the piano, and enjoyed the blues.
</p>
<p>
  "Everyone he touched with his kind and warm heart and his gentle, loving, and nurturing soul, loved him," Harbison said.
