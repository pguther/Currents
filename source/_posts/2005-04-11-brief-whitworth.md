  Shakespeare Santa Cruz artistic director Paul Whitworth is featured in the new West End and New York hit play <i>Blue/Orange,</i> running through May 15 at the Aurora Theatre in Berkeley.
</p>
<p>
  Called a "ferocious comedy, with dialogue fueled by testosterone and paced like a volley of bullets" by the <i>New York Times</i>, this incendiary tale, set in a London psychiatric hospital, follows a young man brazenly claiming to be the son of exiled African dictator Idi Amin, and the two rival psychiatrists who fight over his diagnosis and treatment. Whitworth is cast as Robert, a pompous psychiatrist.
</p>
<p>
  A sharply observed, irreverently funny social critique that examines society's obsession with class, race, and madness, the play is a winner of England's coveted Olivier Award for Best New Play, the <i>Evening Standard</i> Best Play of the Year, and the Critics Circle Award for Best New Play.
