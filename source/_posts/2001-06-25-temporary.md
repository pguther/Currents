The University of California Retirement Plan (UCRP) Service Credit Allocation Program was created to provide retirement service credit to certain eligible UCRP members in recognition of past time worked in temporary positions.

During the week of June 18, 2001, more than 15,000 University staff employees were notified that they had automatically received either one or two years of retirement plan service credit under this program. The additional service credit increases the value of their future retirement benefits if they otherwise qualify to receive retirement benefits.

This program is specifically for UC employees working in staff appointments. A separate program is being developed to provide UCRP service credit to eligible academic personnel. Information about service credit for academic personnel will be provided later this year.

**To Request an Allocation**

The automatic allocations announced in June were based on the best available records, and it is possible that they did not identify everyone who is eligible. If you are a staff employee who did not receive an automatic allocation, you may be eligible to receive an allocation upon request.

You are eligible for a UCRP service credit allocation if you:

1\. had an active University staff appointment on January 1, 2001 (or were on an approved leave with or without pay on that date); and

2\. were an active UCRP member on January 1, 2001 (or will become a UCRP member by December 31, 2001); and

3\. had a period of temporary employment at UC that:

* occurred before January 1, 2001; and
* lasted at least six consecutive months, based on your appointment start and end dates (regardless of the hours or percentage of time worked).

To receive an allocation, your past University employment must not be exempt from this program. The deadline for allocation requests is July 31, 2002. If you think you may be eligible, see the One-time UCRP Service Credit Allocation Program booklet for complete eligibility requirements, forms, and instructions on requesting an allocation.

The booklet is available at the [UCbencom web site][1] or from your Benefits Office. Your Benefits Office can also answer your questions about this program.

**To Appeal the Allocation**

UCRP members who received an allocation but believe they qualify for more service credit may _forfeit_ their allocation and appeal for a correction of the service credit allocation under this program.

The deadline for appeals is July 31, 2002. Eligibility requirements and information on appealing an allocation are included in the One-time UCRP Service Credit Allocation Program booklet. Your Benefits Office can answer your questions about making an appeal.
