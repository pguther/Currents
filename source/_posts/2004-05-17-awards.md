Awards and Honors

Readers Digest names UCSC Banana Slug top college mascot  

UCSC's diminutive Banana Slug is basking in the glory of a new honor following its selection as Best Mascot by _Reader's Digest_ magazine.  

![][1]The May issue of the magazine noted that the Philly Phanatic has a devoted following, and has been called "the funniest team creature out there."  

"But for reminding fans that games are supposed to be fun, nothing beats the Banana Slug of the University of California, Santa Cruz," the article said. "In 1965, students chose the bright yellow mollusk, native to the region, to protest the fierce athletic competition at America's colleges. Win or lose, you still gotta laugh."  

The mascot ranking was part of the magazine's "Americas 100 Best," featuring everything from cookies to comedians. "But this is far more than just a list--it celebrates our country and our lives," editor-in-chief Jacqueline Leo wrote to UCSC Athletic Director Greg Harshaw in a letter accompanying the "Best of America" certificate.  

The _Reader's Digest_ honor is not the first for the Banana Slug, which has inched to the top of various college mascot competitions over the years.
