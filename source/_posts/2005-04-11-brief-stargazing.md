**Astronomy Workshop**  
NASA/Ames researcher Joe Jordan will lead an evening of stargazing on Tuesday, April 12, from 7 to 11 p.m. The wonders of the night sky, the basics of observational astronomy, "cosmic ecology," and information on resources and equipment are covered first at an indoor lecture-discussion. Then the class will hike to upper campus to view constellations, planets, galaxies, and nebulae (weather permitting). Bring binoculars (if you have them), and warm, layered clothing. The workshop begins at the Bay Tree Conference Center, Room C. The cost is $15.
