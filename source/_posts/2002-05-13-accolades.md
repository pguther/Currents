### New parking structure wins design awards

UCSC's Core West Parking Structure has received awards this year from the Concrete Reinforcing Institute (CRSI) and the International Parking Institute.  
  
"The competition consisted of submissions ranging from single-family homes to skyscrapers, and from bridges to stadiums," noted CRSI in a letter to Transportation and Parking Services director Wes Scott in announcing its design awards in January. "CRSI is committed to promoting these excellent designs on behalf of those who have created these structures, and to encourage others to be inspired by their accomplishments."  
  
The International Parking Institute gave UCSC an Award of Excellence, the highest honor in the competition. The award will be presented in Toronto, Ontario, in June.  
  
In 2001, the parking garage received a construction award from the Northern California and Western Nevada Chapter of the American Concrete Institute in the "structural" category.  
  
Watry Design Group was the architect of record on the project, and the firm of Esherick Homsey Dodge and Davis was the design architect. The parking structure opened in March 2001.

### Physics grad student Greg Novak wins Department of Energy fellowship

Greg Novak, a graduate student in astrophysics, has been awarded a Computational Science Graduate Fellowship from the Department of Energy (DOE-CSGF). The DOE-CSGF is a highly competitive program that provides fellows with benefits including a monthly stipend of $2,100 and payment of all tuition and fees. In return, fellows must complete course work in a scientific or engineering discipline, computer science, and applied mathematics. Fellows in this program also complete a three-month practicum at a Department of Energy laboratory.  
  
"The DOE-CSGF will allow me to pursue two of my interests since childhood: astrophysics and computer science," says Novak. "High performance computation is playing a larger and larger role in science today, and the expertise I'll gain while participating in the fellowship program will allow me to solve interesting astrophysical problems through large-scale calculations."
