There are openings in the following Recreation Department classes. Call (831) 459-2806 to register.  

**Astronomy Workshop with Joe Jordan**  
Tuesday, February 8, from 7 to 11 p.m., Bay Tree Conference Center, Room D, $15  
In an evening of stargazing, learn everything you wanted to know about astronomy and space. The wonders of the night sky, the basics of observational astronomy, "cosmic ecology," and information on resources and equipment are covered first at an indoor lecture-discussion. Then we will hike to upper campus to view constellations, planets, galaxies, and nebulae (weather permitting). Bring binoculars (if you have them) and warm, layered clothing. Instructor Joe Jordan works for NASA/Ames and most recently has been involved in the search for planets around other stars.  
  
**Ballroom Dance**  
Saturday, February 12, 1 to 3 p.m., Multipurpose Room, East Field House, $10  
Singles and couples are welcome in this fun introduction to social ballroom dancing. The class will concentrate on swing and waltz. Wear comfortable clothes and comfortable laced or buckled shoes. You can learn the basics of these dances in an hour each. No previous experience necessary. Instructor David Smith has been dancing ballroom for 16 years. He taught social ballroom classes for the UC Ballroom Dancers at UC Berkeley from 1997 to 2003 and is a new assistant professor of physics at UCSC.
