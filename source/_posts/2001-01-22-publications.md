#### Nirvikar Singh

Economist Nirvikar Singh has taken the Internet plunge and accepted an invitation to publish commentaries on [SAWAAL.com][1], which bills itself as a "single point for information and web-enabled services for the Indian surfer on the net."

SAWAAL offers everything from international news, TV listings, and horoscopes to individual investment tracking services and stock market monitoring. So far, Singh has published two columns, one entitled, "Building the Foundations of India's New Economy," and the second called, "Dot.com Deflation: What the Burst Bubble Means for India."

Singh, a professor of economics at UCSC and director of the Business Management Economics Program, specializes in e-commerce strategy, the economics of governance, and economic reform in India._
