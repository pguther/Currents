Staff HR launches new job application web site

Staff Human Resources has launched a new [Web Employment Application][2] system. This new system provides both on- and off-campus applicants with a fast, easy way to apply for positions at UCSC electronically.

Those interested in applying for a job no longer need to go to the SHR office. They simply review the list of jobs posted on the [SHR web site][3], view the job announcement that interests them, and click the "Apply Now" button to access the Web Employment Application. The applicant then creates a profile, enters their cover letter and/or resume information, and clicks the submit button.

Applicants with a current web browser will be able to save their profile data, eliminating the need to repeatedly complete standard personnel information when applying for different jobs.

For more information contact Lori Castro at (831) 459-2960 or [lhcastro@ucsc.edu][4].
