Rosa Linda Fregoso, professor and chair of Latin American and Latino studies, has been selected to receive a top award from the Modern Language Association of America.

Fregoso will receive the second annual MLA Prize in United States Latina and Latino and Chicana and Chicano Literary and Cultural Studies Award for her book, _MeXicana Encounters: The Making of Social Identities on the Borderlands._ The award, which was announced November 22, will be presented December 28 during the association's annual convention, to be held this year in Philadelphia.

The prize, one of 16 awards that will be presented, is awarded for an outstanding scholarly study of Latina or Latino or Chicana or Chicano literature or culture. Fregoso will receive a certificate and a check for $1,000.

In selecting _MeXicana Encounters,_ the committee called the book "theoretically astute, sensitive to Chicana/o issues, deeply committed to a progressive political mission, and articulated in an elegant, readable writing style."

The book "weds the finest elements of personal narrative to highly sophisticated cultural studies readings" and presents "an outstanding study of films and cultural issues."
