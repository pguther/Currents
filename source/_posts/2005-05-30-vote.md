  Students voted to raise their fees $27 per quarter for Student Health Center improvements and approved some smaller fee increases in the spring campus election.
</p>
<p>
  Defeated were proposals for a multiuse student event center ($175/quarter); athletic, intramural, and club teams ($24/quarter), and multiuse outdoor events/soccer venue ($45).
</p>

  Results are available on the campus elections web site: <a href="http://elections.ucsc.edu/elections05/results.html">elections.ucsc.edu/elections05/results.html</a>; details on each ballot item are also online, at <a href="http://elections.ucsc.edu/elections05/ballot.html">elections.ucsc.edu/elections05/ballot.html</a><br>

</p>
<p>
  * <a href="http://elections.ucsc.edu/elections05/measures.cfm#measure14">Measure 14: Campus Sustainability Programs Fee Increase</a><br>
  <br>

</p>
<p>
  * <a href="http://elections.ucsc.edu/elections05/measures.cfm#measure16">Measure 16: Student Voice and Empowerment Fee</a><br>
  <br>
  * <a href="http://elections.ucsc.edu/elections05/measures.cfm#measure17">Measure 17: Modification to Engaging Education Programs Fee Language (Measure 10)</a>
</p>
<p>
  * <a href="http://elections.ucsc.edu/elections05/measures.cfm#measure18">Measure 18: Student Health Center Facilities Improvement Fee</a>
</p>
<p>
  Undergraduate voter turnout was 33.3 percent, and graduate turnout 19.5 percent, said Gail Heit, associate vice chancellor of Student Affairs.
</p>
<p>
  One measure, the graduate Campus Sustainability Programs Fee Increase, failed to meet the minimum voting pool requirement of 25 percent, Heit said. Undergraduates passed the measure by 57.30 percent, with a voter turnout of 29.31 percent, but graduate students did not pass Measure 14, and had a voter turnout of 18.59 percent. Although 62.04 percent of the graduate students voted "yes," the vote failed because voter turnout was below 25 percent.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The Student Health Center Facilities Improvement Fee of $27/quarter will go into effect for graduates and undergraduates upon completion of the renovations, estimated to be fall 2009, Heit said.<br>
</p>
<p>
  If the fee increases are approved by the UC President Robert C. Dynes, fall 2005 undergraduate fees will increase by $14.95/quarter.<br>
