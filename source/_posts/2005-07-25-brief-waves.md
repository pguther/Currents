The Seymour Center at Long Marine Lab will host a special lunch-hour book event by Steve Hawk, former editor of _Surfer_ magazine and author of the new book _Waves_, on July 26 at 12:30 p.m. in the La Feliz Room. The event is free and open to the public.

As a journalist and lifelong wave-rider, Steve Hawk has assembled a mesmerizing collection of images from New Zealand to Newfoundland, and paired them with insightful ruminations on the science and poetry of waves.

Steve Hawk can also be heard at Capitola Book Cafe at 7:30 p.m. the same day. The Book Cafe will generously donate 20 percent of proceeds from Tuesday's sales of _Waves_ to the Seymour Marine Discovery Center's education programs.
