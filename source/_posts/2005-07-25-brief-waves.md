  The Seymour Center at Long Marine Lab will host a special lunch-hour book event by Steve Hawk, former editor of <i>Surfer</i> magazine and author of the new book <i>Waves</i>, on July 26 at 12:30 p.m. in the La Feliz Room. The event is free and open to the public.
</p>
<p>
  As a journalist and lifelong wave-rider, Steve Hawk has assembled a mesmerizing collection of images from New Zealand to Newfoundland, and paired them with insightful ruminations on the science and poetry of waves.
</p>
<p>
  Steve Hawk can also be heard at Capitola Book Cafe at 7:30 p.m. the same day. The Book Cafe will generously donate 20 percent of proceeds from Tuesday's sales of <i>Waves</i> to the Seymour Marine Discovery Center's education programs.
