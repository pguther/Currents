The holiday season brings a time for celebration with family, friends, and coworkers, but preparation and participation in these celebrations can challenge our time, energy, and willpower and make it difficult to meet our fitness and weight management commitments.  

To help find the right balance, the Wellness Center is offering a free Holiday Fitness & Weight Management Strategies seminar on Tuesday, November 16, from noon to 1 p.m. in the Bay Tree Conference Room A. The seminar will present tips for maintaining healthy lifestyle choices through time management strategies, travel fitness ideas, exercise options, and managing holiday feasts.   

Space is limited, so call (831) 459-3970 to reserve a spot.
