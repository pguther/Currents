The New World and the Old Country come together in a special symphonic concert set for November 4 and 5, at 7:30 p.m. in the Music Center Recital Hall. The UC Santa Cruz Orchestra, conducted by Professor Nicole Paiement, will perform the world premiere of the orchestral version of _Parcel From America,_ a Christmas tale of Irish music, song, dance, and storytelling by native Irish writer/storyteller Tomaseen Foley. The program will also include Czech composer Antonin Dvorak's symphony Symphony No. 9 in E minor, subtitled _From the New World._

Paiement and UCSC lecturer, guitarist, and recording artist William Coulter have teamed up with Santa Cruz composer/musician Barry Phillips to present _Parcel From America_, which weaves a story from Foley's youth in Ireland. Based on one of the stories from Foley's popular touring production _A Celtic Christmas_\--which Coulter has performed in and been musical director of since1996--_Parcel_ has typically been performed by a band of Celtic musicians. Coulter's longtime collaborator Barry Phillips recently arranged the piece for orchestra, and this new version will receive its premiere at the UCSC concert.

_Parcel from America_ will feature the UCSC Orchestra, guitarist Coulter, and storyteller Foley--plus David Brewer on uilleann pipes and whistle, Deby Benton Grosjean on fiddle, vocalist Moira Smiley, and Irish dancers Kathleen Keane and Bethany Duff. This concert is presented by the UCSC Music Department with additional support from a Porter College Visiting Artists grant. For ticket information, contact the UCSC Ticket Office at (831) 459-2159.
