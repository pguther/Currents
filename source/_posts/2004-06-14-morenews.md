Alan Richards testifies before Senate panel  

Environmental studies professor Alan Richards, an expert on the politics of the Middle East, testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee during a hearing on the Greater Middle East Initiative.  

Invited by the committee, Richards testified June 2 about the 21st Century Trust concept proposed by committee chairman Senator Richard G. Lugar (R-Indiana).   

Richards described the experience as "interesting," saying Lugar was "clearly engaged." Testifying late in the session, Richards said his own role   
"turned into a private tutorial for Lugar."

"I got the opportunity to say 'Osama is winning the propaganda war, and we are helping him,'" recalled Richards, who went on to offer his "60-second version of the socioeconomic roots of radicalism."  

"Lugar understands that military action alone will not make us safer, and so, if I was able to provide him with anything useful, it was worth the exhausting 48 hour round-trip," said Richards, whose testimony is available on the [U.S. Senate website][3].
