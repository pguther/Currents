  <span class="sectionhead"><a name="richards" id="richards"></a>Alan Richards testifies before Senate panel</span><br>
</p>
<p>
  Environmental studies professor Alan Richards, an expert on the politics of the Middle East, testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee during a hearing on the Greater Middle East Initiative.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Invited by the committee, Richards testified June 2 about the 21st Century Trust concept proposed by committee chairman Senator Richard G. Lugar (R-Indiana).<br>
</p>
<p>
  Richards described the experience as "interesting," saying Lugar was "clearly engaged." Testifying late in the session, Richards said his own role<br>
  "turned into a private tutorial for Lugar."
</p>
<p>
  "I got the opportunity to say 'Osama is winning the propaganda war, and we are helping him,'" recalled Richards, who went on to offer his "60-second version of the socioeconomic roots of radicalism."<br>
</p>
<p>
  "Lugar understands that military action alone will not make us safer, and so, if I was able to provide him with anything useful, it was worth the exhausting 48 hour round-trip," said Richards, whose testimony is available on the <a href="http://foreign.senate.gov/hearings/2004/hrg040602a.html">U.S. Senate website</a>.<br>
