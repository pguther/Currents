UCSC Arboretum

The UCSC Arboretum hosted "Art in the Arboretum" and "New Zealand Day" together in late May. Chancellor Greenwood and [Arboretum][1] staff greeted the two consul generals of New Zealand for the festivities and led them on tours of the New Zealand garden.

The Arboretum event was one of Consul General Darryl Dunn's first official functions since taking over his new duties, which include responsibilities in 13 western states of the U.S.  
  
The day was marked with dancing, Maori stories for children, craft demonstrations, flower arranging, and art shows by local artists and a New Zealand artist. Thirteen pieces about the New Zealand Bush by the New Zealand artist Rei Hamon were displayed and then donated to the Arboretum for a continuing show in Horticulture Building II.  
  
A new dance, "Zap! The Garden," was performed in the outback of the Australian garden. Polynesian dances were held in the New Zealand garden. Many of the dancers were current or former UCSC students, and "Zap!" was choreographed by professor of theater arts Mel Wong.  
  
Joan Norvelle, Shirley Beneke, and other talented volunteers produced the event in conjunction with Arboretum staff. Funds raised support the Arboretum.
