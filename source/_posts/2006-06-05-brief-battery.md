<p>
  Batteries may no longer be disposed of in the trash and must be recycled separately. Housing Services, Campus Recycling, and Environmental Health and Safety are coordinating a campuswide battery roundup June 5-23.
</p>
<p>
  Batteries may be dropped off in the marked containers at the bookstore, libraries, college offices, and dining halls. (No car batteries.)
