United Way of Santa Cruz County honored UCSC for its participation in the organization's 1999 fund-raising campaign at a Victory Celebration last week.

UCSC received the Gold Award as the highest donor in the education division. This is one of the highest honors accorded to any business or organization contributing to the annual fund-raising campaign.

Over 600 members of the UCSC community contributed approximately $78,000. After Granite Rock Company, UCSC contributed the largest amount of any local organization.

Countywide, United Way collected over $1.5 million, which will go to programs that support county youth, the disabled, families in need, the elderly, and those in emergency situations. Some of the programs that are supported by United Way are Big Brothers/Big Sisters, American Red Cross, Walnut Avenue Women's Center, Community Connections, and Foster Grandparent/Senior Companion Program.

Among the people representing UCSC at the Victory Celebration were Marlene Olson, UCSC chair of United Way and media director for student press; Robin Chanin, UCSC assistant chair of United Way and print adviser of student media; Ron Suduiko, vice chancellor of University Relations; Gesna Clarke, assistant director of Housing, Dining, and Child Care Services; M.R.C. Greenwood, UCSC chancellor and United Way Board of Directors member; and John Holloway, executive director of student development and community services.

Many other UCSC people helped out in the fund drive, including Tara Crowley, Tammy Heinsohn, Judy Hobar, Elizabeth Irwin, Judy McCarrick, and Dee O'Brien.
