The UC Board of Regents recently adopted revised investment guidelines for   
the university's various pension fund assets, including the UC Retirement   
Plan (UCRP), the General Endowment Pool (GEP) and the Equity and Bond   
Portfolio investment options offered by the Tax-Deferred 403(b) Plan and   
Defined Contribution Plan.  
  
Information about these investment policies and the review that led to the   
changes is now available on the UCOP "News and Facts" [Web page][1].
