  The UC Board of Regents recently adopted revised investment guidelines for<br>
  the university's various pension fund assets, including the UC Retirement<br>
  Plan (UCRP), the General Endowment Pool (GEP) and the Equity and Bond<br>
  Portfolio investment options offered by the Tax-Deferred 403(b) Plan and<br>
  Defined Contribution Plan.<br>
  <br>
  Information about these investment policies and the review that led to the<br>
  changes is now available on the UCOP "News and Facts" <a href="http://www.ucop.edu/ucophome/commserv/UCOP_adopt_new_investment_policies.htm">Web page</a>.<br>
