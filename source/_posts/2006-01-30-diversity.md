  All members of the campus community are urged to participate in an online campus diversity survey launched by the Committee on Affirmative Action and Diversity (CAAD). Following a series of public forums last fall, the survey is the latest phase of an unprecedented effort to study the diversity climate on campus.
</p>
<p>
  The survey, which should take about 15 minutes to complete, is designed for all students, staff, and faculty at UCSC. As of January 30, survey organizers were making plans to distribute a personal e-mail in early February to members of the campus community, with an individualized link to the survey's web site to ensure confidentiality of submissions and the overall accuracy of the survey.

  With input from forum participants, CAAD members broadened survey topics to include issues of multiracial and transgender identification, sexuality, citizenship, religion, income, and social support, said Gina Dent, associate professor of feminist studies and chair of CAAD. "With your participation, we will have a study of extraordinary scale and scope," she added.

  The survey will be available in Spanish for those who request it; it will be administered verbally in Spanish or English to employees in job categories not well served by campus e-mail, said Dent.
