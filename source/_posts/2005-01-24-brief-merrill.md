In celebration of her new book, critically acclaimed performance artist Denise Uyehara will share excerpts from her body of work at 7 p.m. on Tuesday, February 1, at the Merrill College Cultural Center. The book, _Maps of City & Body: Shedding Light on the Performances of Denise Uyehara_, brings together Uyehara's performance works of the last 15 years.  

Uyehara's performance will be followed by a conversation with Uyehara and a book-signing. Uyehara is a pioneering performance artist, one of the first to explore Asian American queer subjectivity through performance.
