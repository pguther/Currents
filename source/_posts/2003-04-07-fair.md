    - caption: "Lisa J. Rose (Crown '72), UCSC's director of materiel management, talks with former Alumni Association Council member Doug Kaplan (Stevenson '74) at last year's All-Alumni Reunion Luncheon. Rose coordinated an exhibit of vintage photographs by alumni. It will be on display at this year's Crown Provost's Reception and at the 30-year reunion of the Class of '73. The caption for the photo, above, was incorrect in the April 1 newsprint Currents. Lisa J. Rose (from Materiel Management) was identified as Lisa M. Rose (from Long Marine Lab). We apologize for the error."
