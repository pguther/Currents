Joshua Stuart, assistant professor of biomolecular engineering, will be honored by the University of Colorado, Boulder, with the 2006 Kalpana Chawla Outstanding Recent Graduate Award. Stuart will receive the award at a ceremony on May 10.

The Kalpana Chawla Award recognizes alumni who have made exceptional contributions to their field within 10 years of graduation. This award was named to honor the UC-Boulder alumna who died aboard the _Columbia_ space shuttle on February 1, 2003. The award recognizes Stuart's work using large-scale computational approaches to explore how genes function and produce orchestrated cellular responses.

Stuart received a double degree (B.S./B.A.) from UC-Boulder in computer science and molecular, cell, and developmental biology and went on to earn a Ph.D. from Stanford University. He joined the UCSC faculty in 2003. He recently received an Alfred P. Sloan Research Fellowship.
