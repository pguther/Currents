  It's time once again for the annual Strawberry Shortcake Festival at the UCSC Farm. This year's gathering will take place Wednesday, May 25, from 4 to 6 p.m. A $5 donation will get you a huge serving of shortcake smothered in organic strawberries and freshly whipped cream, along with homemade lemonade or coffee from the Community Agroecology Network. After your treat, you'll want to enjoy a Farm tour and some homegrown bluegrass music. Sponsors of the festival include New Leaf Community Markets and Clover Stornetta Farms.
</p>
<p>
  Your donation supports low-income shares in the UCSC Farm's Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) program, which is celebrating its 10th anniversary this year.
</p>
<p>
  The CSA project makes fresh organic produce grown at the UCSC Farm available to households that invest directly in the Farm for an entire growing season. Every week from June through October, CSA members receive a share of the harvest, including organic fruits, vegetables, flowers, and herbs you can pick yourself in the CSA garden. The CSA is a mutually beneficial collaboration between the community and the Farm.
</p>
<p>
  If you would like to join the CSA, shares are still available. Full shares cost $600 and typically feed four to six people for about $27/week. Smaller households are encouraged to team up and split a full share. Payment can be in full or in quarterly installments. Low-income shares are available for $300 each. Members pick up boxes weekly on either Tuesday or Friday at the CSA Barn on the UCSC Farm. Members also receive a weekly newsletter with recipes, farm updates, and a schedule of events; complimentary membership in the Friends of the Farm &amp; Garden for one year; a 10 percent discount on plants at the Farm's spring and fall plant sales; quarterly issues of News &amp; Notes; and two issues of <i>The Cultivar</i>.
