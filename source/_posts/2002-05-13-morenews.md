</h3>
<p>
  <img align="right" alt="strawberry shortcake" border="1" height="115" src="../art/shortcake.125.jpg" width="125">Nothing ushers in spring like a plate heaped high with fresh organic strawberries and whipped cream, so head to the UCSC Farm on Wednesday, May 15, for the annual Strawberry Shortcake Festival from 4 to 6 p.m.

<p>
  Homegrown bluegrass music and hayrides will complement the delicious Farm-baked shortcake that takes center stage during this annual open house, which includes a Farm tour at 5 p.m. A $5 donation will support low-income shares in the Farm's Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) program, and for the first time this year, a silent auction will help raise funds for the CSA.

</h3>
<p>
  <img align="right" border="0" height="100" src="../art/bike2work.gif" width="130" alt="">Santa Cruz County <a href="http://www.bike2work.com/">Bike Week 2002,</a> May 12-18, includes many fun, educational activities designed to get people to commute by bike. Bicycle safety classes, a $1,000 drawing, bike tours, a slide show of a bicycle-friendly town in Germany, and a free breakfast on Bike to School/Work Day are just a few.
</p>
<p>
  On Bike to School/Work Day, May 16, there will be three UCSC breakfast sites--at the top of the bike path, the Women's Center, and the Bike Co-op (in its new location in the old Whole Earth Building). A complete list of breakfast sites can be found by following the links on the web site.
</p>
<p>
  There will also be a commute race on May 14. The race will pit a cyclist against a car driver, a bus rider, and a bike-to-shuttle rider and will conclude at the UCSC Music Center Recital Hall. The goal of the race is to demonstrate how feasible--and quick--it is to commute by bike to UCSC.
