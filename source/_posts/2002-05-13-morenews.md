### Celebrate spring on May 15 with strawberry shortcake at the Farm

![strawberry shortcake][1]Nothing ushers in spring like a plate heaped high with fresh organic strawberries and whipped cream, so head to the UCSC Farm on Wednesday, May 15, for the annual Strawberry Shortcake Festival from 4 to 6 p.m.

Homegrown bluegrass music and hayrides will complement the delicious Farm-baked shortcake that takes center stage during this annual open house, which includes a Farm tour at 5 p.m. A $5 donation will support low-income shares in the Farm's Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) program, and for the first time this year, a silent auction will help raise funds for the CSA.

For more information about CSAs or the Strawberry Shortcake Festival, contact Nancy Vail at (831) 459-4661 or navail@cats.ucsc.edu or Lisa Mosca at (831) 459-3336 or verbena@cats.ucsc.edu. Rain cancels the event.

### Bike Week 2002 offers a variety of activities

![][6]Santa Cruz County [Bike Week 2002,][7] May 12-18, includes many fun, educational activities designed to get people to commute by bike. Bicycle safety classes, a $1,000 drawing, bike tours, a slide show of a bicycle-friendly town in Germany, and a free breakfast on Bike to School/Work Day are just a few.

On Bike to School/Work Day, May 16, there will be three UCSC breakfast sites--at the top of the bike path, the Women's Center, and the Bike Co-op (in its new location in the old Whole Earth Building). A complete list of breakfast sites can be found by following the links on the web site.

There will also be a commute race on May 14. The race will pit a cyclist against a car driver, a bus rider, and a bike-to-shuttle rider and will conclude at the UCSC Music Center Recital Hall. The goal of the race is to demonstrate how feasible--and quick--it is to commute by bike to UCSC.
