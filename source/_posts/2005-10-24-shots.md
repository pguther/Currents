The Student Health Center has adequate supplies of influenza vaccine this year to offer interested staff and faculty as well as students an opportunity to receive flu shots on campus.

Special flu shot clinics are open on November 1-4, from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., except on Wednesday, November 2, when shots are available from noon to 4 p.m.

The cost of the flu shot this year will be $20. Staff and faculty should bring cash or a check made out to the UC Regents. Students' costs will be charged to their university accounts. Additional information on flu shots and other shots that will be available during the clinic is online at [www2.ucsc.edu/healthcenter/bulletins/flu_shot.shtml][1]
