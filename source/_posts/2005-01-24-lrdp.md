Two public meetings have been scheduled for February to provide input to UCSC on the issues to be considered in the Draft Environmental Impact Report that will be prepared for the campus's next Long Range Development Plan (LRDP).

The EIR "scoping" meetings will both take place on February 16: between 3 and 5 p.m. and between 6 and 8 p.m. Both meetings will be held at the UCSC Inn and Conference Center at 611 Ocean Street in Santa Cruz.  

The latest draft of the 2005-20 LRDP, meanwhile, is expected to be released in early February. The Draft LRDP, updated since public comment was received on the document this past fall, is a physical blueprint for growth that is expected to take place on campus during the next 15 years.

When it is completed, it will be posted on UCSC's ["Planning through 2020"][1] web site.  

The EIR will assess the impact of the physical growth forecast in the LRDP. At the two scoping meetings, public agencies and members of the public will be invited to provide oral comments on the range of issues to be addressed in the draft EIR.
