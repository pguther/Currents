Economist **Robert Fairlie** was quoted in a _Washington Times_ story about the digital divide, saying it appears to have fallen off the agenda of legislators. Fairlie's research was also featured on the [Digital Divide Network][1]'s web page.

The _Santa Cruz_ _Sentinel_ featured front-page coverage of postdoctoral researcher **Phil Howard's **survey of consumers regarding their food purchases. Howard, of the Center for Agroecology & Sustainable Food Systems, has fielded calls from Public Citizen and others about the survey. His work will be written up in the March issue of _Sustainable Industries Journal,_ and Howard will appear on KUSP's _Talk of the Bay_ program on Wednesday, February 2.

**Dan Wirls** of politics provided postinauguration analysis for the _Santa Cruz Sentinel_ about President Bush's second-term agenda.
