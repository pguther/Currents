Campus police to crack down on illegal bicycle parking

Bicyclists have been locking their bikes to light posts, handrails, ramps, stairs, and transit shelters. This creates hazards for pedestrians and can prevent access by those with disabilities, thus violating the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).   

The campus is now enforcing the current UCSC code, which states that bicycles "...shall not be parked, stood, or locked against any lightpost, stair railing, ramp, or any portion thereof, nor shall they block in any way curb cuts, ramps, or paths of accessible travel. Bicycles shall be parked in bicycle racks provided; those parked elsewhere may be impounded."

Until January 17 bicycles parked illegally will be issued warnings; beginning on Tuesday, January 21, any illegally parked bicycle may be impounded. The bicycle owner will be responsible for all costs associated with this action, including the citation, an impound fee, and the cost of removing the bicycle from where it is locked.  
  
To report areas where bikes are parked illegally, contact the University Police at (831) 459-2231. If you have any questions about this enforcement effort, contact Susan Willats at (831) 459-3759.

Natural Sciences renamed the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences  

The Division of Natural Sciences has changed its name to the Division of Physical and Biological Sciences. The new name is more reflective of the division's mission, is better understood by the general public, and is more consistent with other UC campuses, said the division's dean, David Kliger.  
Formal approval of the name change was granted by UC's Office of the President in December.   

The change was endorsed by the division's department chairs and the Committee on Planning and Budget. The renaming does not involve any programmatic changes, organizational changes, or changes in any instructional or research programs.

Finalized campus calendar for 2003-04 now available

The [campus calendar][6] for the 2003-04 academic year has been finalized and is now available on the web at [http://reg.ucsc.edu/calendar/2003_04.html.][6] The calendar includes several modifications and has been approved by Campus Provost Simpson. The three primary changes are:  

* In fall 2003, classes begin on Thursday, September 25, rather than Wednesday, September 24, thus restoring valuable orientation time especially important for placing first-year students in appropriate writing classes.  
* In winter 2004, instruction begins on Monday, January 5, rather than Tuesday, January 6, and the advising day is eliminated, thus making it possible for classes to end on Friday, March 12, rather than Tuesday, March 16. As a result, there is no need for final exams to be scheduled on Saturday, and the quarter ends on Thursday, March 18, rather than Sunday, March 21, allowing for a spring break that includes a full week with two weekends.  
* In Spring 2004, instruction begins on Monday, March 29, rather than Tuesday, March 30, thereby restoring the required day of instruction lost by starting classes a day later in the fall.  

Contact Kevin Browne, executive director of admissions and university registrar with any comments or questions at (831) 459-5779 or [kmbrowne@ucsc.edu.][7]
