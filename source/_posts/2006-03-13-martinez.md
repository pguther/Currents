Assistant professor of theater arts Alma Martinez will appear in the Bay Area premiere of Nilo Cruz's 2003 Pulitzer Prize-winning play _Anna in the Tropics_, opening March 11 at Theatre Works in Palo Alto.

Martinez will be reprising the role of "Ofelia," a role she played opposite Jimmy Smits (_West Wing, Star Wars_) and Herbert Siguenza (_Culture Clash_) last summer for an L.A. Theatre Works radio play presented on NPR. A CD of the play can be purchased through the L.A. Theatre Works website at: [www.latw.org][1].

Last spring, Martinez performed in the West Coast premiere of _Electricidad_ by McArthur Award-winner Luis Alfaro at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles. That production--including a photo of Martinez--is featured in a cover story in this month's issue of _American Theatre Magazine_, the premiere professional theatre publication in the country. Martinez' picture is also featured on the book cover of a new anthology of plays just published by Luis Valdez titled _Mummified Deer and Other Plays_. She played the lead character in the world premiere of _Mummified Deer_, also directed by Valdez.
