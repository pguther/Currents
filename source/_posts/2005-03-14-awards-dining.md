  Staff of campus Dining Services garnered awards in local and regional culinary competitions this winter.
</p>
<p>
  Three teams of UCSC cooks entered the Santa Cruz Chowder Cook-Off, held annually in February at the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk. The teams, calling themselves the Redwood Sluggers, Restaurant at UCEN, and the Chowder Slugs, prepared and served close to 50 gallons of chowder.
</p>
<p>
  The Chowder Slugs, led by executive chef Dwight Collins, with team members Bill Prime and Wade Garza, won three awards for their New England clam chowder: first place in the Corporate Division, third place for Overall Most Tasted, and grand prize as the People's Choice.
</p>
<p>
  Julie Mitravich, manager of University Catering, came away with a bronze medal in the Culinary Challenge competition at the regional meeting of the National Association of College and University Food Services at Stanford University last month.
</p>
<p>
  Mitravich competed against 10 other executive chefs from the Pacific Region and won the bronze with her entree of lamb loin wrapped in red chard with a pomegranate and fresh rosemary glaze, lemon thyme barley risotto, and organic beets.
</p>
<p>
  Mitravich joined the Dining Services team last year when the campus transitioned from Sodexho to self operation.
