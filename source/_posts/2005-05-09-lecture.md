Larry Overman, distinguished professor of chemistry at UC Irvine, will give the 2005 Joseph F. Bunnett Research Organic Chemistry Lecture on Friday, May 13, at 4 p.m. in the University Center Bhojwani Dining Room. A reception will follow in the alumni room featuring wines of the Santa Cruz Mountains.  

Overman's research interests center on the invention of new reactions and strategies in organic synthesis and the total synthesis of natural products and related compounds. Using synthesis strategies developed largely in his laboratory, Overman's group has completed total syntheses of more than 90 structurally complex natural products.  

Overman is a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. His scientific awards include the Arthur C. Cope Award of the American Chemical Society, the ACS Award for Creative Work in Synthetic Organic Chemistry, the ACS Arthur C. Cope Scholar Award, the Yamada Prize, the Centenary Medal of the Chemical Society of the United Kingdom, the S. T. Li Prize for Achievements in Science and Technology, a Senior Scientist Award of the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation, the Camille and Henry Dreyfus Teacher-Scholar Award, and Fellowships from the Alfred P. Sloan and Guggenheim Foundations.  

The Bunnett lecture series is hosted by the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry in honor of Professor Emeritus Joseph Bunnett. Additional information is available online at [chemistry.ucsc.edu/alumni/events.html][1].
