#### Public hearing on Physical Sciences Building EIR to be held October 19

The campus Environmental Assessment Group is preparing a Draft Environmental Impact Report (DEIR) for the new Physical Sciences Building. The proposed project is the construction of an approximately five-story, approximately 78,500-assignable-square- feet Physical Sciences Building on the site of an existing parking lot just southeast of the intersection of McLaughlin Drive and Steinhart Way in the central campus. The building would accommodate programs in chemistry, environmental toxicology, and engineering.  
  
A public hearing will be held on October 19 between 6 and 8 p.m., at the Barn Theater. At this meeting, campus planners will provide a description of the project and its environmental effects, and members of the public will be invited to give oral comments on the Draft EIR for the project. Call Ann Bertken at (831) 459-4760 for additional information or to request accommodations for persons with disabilities.

#### G-FEST Film Festival

G-FEST Film Festival will take place on Saturday, October 23, from 7 to 10 p.m. in Classroom Unit 2. Come and enjoy an evening of adrenaline and watch the very best high-risk action sport films from around the world. Skiing, surfing, skydiving, climbing, skating, biking and more. G-FEST is about the intersection of art and sport--wild nail-biting, sweat-soaked moving pictures, and stills of people harnessing gravity (the g- get it?). The cost is $6/student and $7/community. Sponsored by the Recreation Office.

#### EEO/AA Office launching campuswide exit interview program

Over the past year, the number of career employees who have separated from UCSC has doubled from the previous year. To better understand the variables that affect staff employee retention, the EEO/AA Office launched a campuswide exit interview program October 1. At the beginning of each month, the EEO/AA office will send an exit interview questionnaire to all career staff who have separated from the university during the previous month. The option for an in-person interview will be made available, with EEO/AA staff doing those interviews as requested.  
  
After one year of collecting this information, EEO/AA will issue a report with recommendations for action. The interviews will help to identify where improvements can be made to campus climate, management, and conditions of employment for staff. The interviews may help identify the campus's strengths as an employer as well. Units currently conducting exit interviews are encouraged to continue and to use the information to positively impact retention. For more information about the exit interview program, contact Lynda Tanaka at (831) 459-2686, tanaka@cats.ucsc.edu.
