  Students seeking Deans' Undergraduate Awards, Chancellor's Undergraduate Awards, and the Steck Award must get their projects and applications in by April 14.
</p>
<p>
  Forms are available from the offices of the chancellor, divisions, departments, and colleges. Students should submit their materials directly to their department, committee, or program offices. Departments will then forward their nominations for review for Deans' and Chancellor's Awards.
</p>
<p>
  The winners will be honored at the Student Achievement Awards ceremony at 3 p.m. on June 9 at the College Nine/College Ten Multipurpose Room. The awards recognize exceptional achievements in research projects or other creative academic activities, and are designed to encourage outstanding scholarship and promote research as an important part of undergraduate education.
</p>
<p>
  Each Dean's Award winner will receive $100 and a certificate, and will be considered for the additional Chancellor's Award. Winners of the Chancellor's Awards will be considered for the Steck Award.
</p>
<p>
  The Steck Award honors the most outstanding completed senior thesis/research project. The student selected for this award will receive $1,000 and a certificate. In addition, the winner's senior thesis/research project will be bound and copies given to the student, the research supervisor, McHenry Library, Special Collections, the student's college and division, and to the Steck family, whose generous contributions have made this award possible.
</p>
