<font color="#003399">Bench in Native Plant Area dedicated to late professor Ken Norris</font>
<p>
  Friends and family of the late Ken Norris, professor of natural history, gathered on Saturday, September 8, for a picnic lunch at the bench placed in Norris's memory in the Native Plant Area north of the UCSC Arboretum. About 60 people and one gopher snake showed up for the informal gathering, organized by Maggie Fusari, director of the UCSC Natural Reserves. The bench was built with salvaged redwood from the Landels-Hill Big Creek Reserve by the resident steward, Feynner Arias. Big Creek is part of the UC Natural Reserve System founded by Norris. The inscription, which reads "It sure beats working," was chosen by the Norris family and inscribed by Rick Flores of the UCSC Arboretum. The Native Plant Area is jointly managed by the Arboretum and the UCSC Campus Reserve.

  <font color="#003399">Staff and faculty mentors sought</font>
</h3>
<p>
  The Page and Eloise Smith Scholastic Society is bringing together UCSC alumni, faculty, and staff to serve the educational aspirations of UCSC students who are foster children, wards of the court, and orphans. There are over 40 of these students on campus this fall. They are receiving scholarships from the Page and Eloise Smith Scholastic Society, but they will also need other help.<br>
  <br>
  Can you help someone through the registration process? Could you correspond occasionally via e-mail with a student needing advice about a major? Perhaps you could help a new student connect with just the right faculty member to explore their visions or goals. If you are interested in any level of mentorship relationship with a current student who has been a foster child, ward of the court, or orphan, please contact Lynn Zachreson in the Alumni Office at (831) 459-5842.
