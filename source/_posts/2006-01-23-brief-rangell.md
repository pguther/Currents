Art lecturer Paul Rangell will travel to Hawaii in February to serve as juror and visiting artist for the annual invitational show of the Honolulu Printmakers, a private association of artists. The exhibition is open to all print artists in Hawaii. Rangell will present two lectures and a three-day workshop on transfer lithography at the event.

Rangell has served as a full-time lecturer in printmaking and drawing at UCSC since 1983 and has received several awards for distinguished teaching. He has participated in numerous exhibitions in Europe and throughout the Western United States in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Seattle, Santa Fe, and Santa Cruz.

A 1977 UCSC graduate, Rangell was named 2003 Distinguished Artist of the Year by the Santa Cruz Art League.
