<p>
  The fifth annual Children's Art Show--from April 3 to April 15 at the Women's Center--is being expanded this year to include poetry and stories of less than 50 words in addition to artwork.
</p>
<p>
  Art pieces may be submitted by children ages 3 to 13 who attend the Granary Child Development Center, Children's Center, and School Center. Contributions are also welcome from children whose parents or grandparents are faculty, staff, or students at UCSC.
</p>
<p>
  All submissions must be submitted with information about the child (name and age) and art should be ready for display (at a minimum, in a paper frame).
</p>
<p>
  Submissions must be dropped off between March 30 and April 1 at the Women's Center. For more information, contact the Women's Center at (831) 459-2291.<br>
