The fifth annual Children's Art Show--from April 3 to April 15 at the Women's Center--is being expanded this year to include poetry and stories of less than 50 words in addition to artwork.

Art pieces may be submitted by children ages 3 to 13 who attend the Granary Child Development Center, Children's Center, and School Center. Contributions are also welcome from children whose parents or grandparents are faculty, staff, or students at UCSC.

All submissions must be submitted with information about the child (name and age) and art should be ready for display (at a minimum, in a paper frame).

Submissions must be dropped off between March 30 and April 1 at the Women's Center. For more information, contact the Women's Center at (831) 459-2291.
