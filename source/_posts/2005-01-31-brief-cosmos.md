Students who love math and science and excel in these subjects have a chance to spend four weeks in residence at a University of California campus this summer learning about astronomy, marine mammal biology, robotics, computer graphics, environmental science and ecology, earthquake engineering, bioinformatics, tissue and tumor biology, physics and technology, and more.

![][1]The mission of the California State Summer School for Mathematics and Science, popularly known as COSMOS, is to motivate the most creative minds of the new generation of prospective scientists, engineers, and mathematicians in California and the nation, and to create a community of scholars.

COSMOS programs are offered at UC Davis, UC Irvine, UC Santa Cruz and, for the first time, at UC San Diego through the Jacobs School of Engineering.
