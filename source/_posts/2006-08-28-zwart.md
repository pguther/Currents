The association's Distinguished Service Award recognizes individuals who have made a significant contribution in building and planning for higher education. Honorees are conferred with the title of Fellow of the Association of University Architects. A 1971 graduate of Cowell College, Zwart joined the Office of Physical Planning and Construction in May 1985, and has been campus architect since August 1988.

Zwart hosted the association's annual conference at UCSC in June 1995, and was the organization's president in 2002-03. He received the award at the association's annual conference in June, held at the University of Texas in Austin.

The Association of University Architects was founded by university architects in Chicago in June 1955, and provides a forum for campus architects to communicate and exchange ideas. Its membership is limited to licensed architects who have professional responsibility for the physical development of a campus or of a multicampus university or college system.
