  Over 25 local, national, and international filmmakers and performing artists will be spotlighted in the 12th annual Women of Color Film and Video Festival, April 22-24 at the Media Theater on campus.
</p>
<p>
  Since 1991, the UCSC Research Cluster for Women of Color has screened more than 300 films, hosted workshops, and presented panel discussions with a wide variety of both established and up-and-coming filmmakers. Sponsored by UCSC's Center for Cultural Studies, the research group is composed of graduate students and faculty engaged in the study of women of color.<br>
</p>
<p>
  The theme of this year's festival is "Disrupting Borders: Seeing Silences and Imagining Trans-Formations." The films range from Anita Wen-Shin Chang's 52-minute film about discovering the political sensibility of her 100-year-old Taiwanese activist grandmother and Nicole Willis's documentary exploring the impact of incarceration on mothers and children in Texas, to <i>Boi Hair,</i> Alma Lopez's documentary short about queer women of color and their short hair, and <i>La Tortilla,</i> a seven-minute short by UCSC alumna Azucena Varela that shows how tortilla makers are sculptors that conjure up the past as they shape maize dough to feed present and future generations.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "They're all very different films--it's a diverse mix of dramas, documentaries, and some comedy," noted Susy Zepeda, codirector of the festival. "We put out a call for films and people responded. There are three films from Mexico, one from Bangladesh, and other submissions from New York, Texas, and Washington State."<br>
</p>
<p>
  "Our goal is to understand what is actually happening in the lives of women of color--to map the territory of where they are today," Zepeda added. "The focus is not just on the negative aspects but also to explore the possibilities for change and transformation."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Zepeda said that the 2005 festival will include panel discussions and four keynote speakers who will discuss why they created their films. Performances of African folk-fusion music, rap, and spoken word will also be presented.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "Most of the filmmakers will be attending the festival," Zepeda noted.
</p>
<p>
  "We're very excited about this opportunity to foster communication and dialogue about women of color."<br>
</p>
<p>
  All events at the Women of Color Film and Video Festival are free and open to the public. Light refreshments will be provided.
