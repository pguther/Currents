John Mock, lecturer in Hindi and Urdu, has been elected to the Board of Trustees of the American Institute of Afghanistan Studies for a three-year term--2007 to 2010. The institute is a private, non-profit organization founded in 2003 to support research on all aspects of Afghanistan's history and culture, and to promote scholarly ties between Afghanistan and the United States. Its aim is to increase the number of scholars in the United States who have expertise in Afghanistan, as well as to assist in the rebuilding of academic institutions and the advanced study of Afghanistan by Afghan scholars.

Mock teaches all of the Hindi and Urdu classes at UCSC. He holds Ph.D. and M.A. degrees from UC Berkeley in South and Southeast Asian studies, specializing in South Asian languages and literature. Mock's expertise includes the languages and cultures of northern Pakistan and Afghanistan, and he speaks Urdu, Wakhi, Hindi, and Nepali, among other languages.
