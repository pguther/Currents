John Thompson, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology and director of the STEPS Institute for Innovation in Environmental Research, has been named president-elect of the American Society of Naturalists for 2007 and will serve as president during 2008.

Founded in 1883, the American Society of Naturalists is one of the oldest professional societies in the biological sciences in North America. Its purpose is to advance and diffuse knowledge of organic evolution and other broad biological principles so as to enhance the conceptual unification of the biological sciences.

Thompson, the author of three books on coevolution, studies how interactions among species organize the Earth's biodiversity over broad geographic landscapes.
