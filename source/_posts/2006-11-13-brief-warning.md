Drivers are being warned to be especially watchful for deer during the next few months.

The sharp curve where Coolidge Drive bends around to become McLaughlin Drive is a particular trouble spot, according to Dean Raven, senior superintendent of grounds services.

A number of deer often congregate in that area. The deer are now rutting, and in the spring the fawns will be born.
