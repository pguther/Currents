Nominations for Regents' professors and lecturers are now being sought, with screening to begin with applications received by May 11.

The Regents' lecturers and professors program is designed to bring distinguished individuals, ordinarily from nonacademic careers, to the university. Regents' lecturers serve for less than a quarter but more than two weeks, and Regents' professors serve for a quarter or an academic year. Nominations should originate from academic units rather than individuals.

Additional information is available [online][1]. Screening will begin with applications received by May 11.

For questions about the program, contact Jessica Fiske Bailey at (831) 459-4307, or e-mail [jfbailey@ucsc.edu][2].
