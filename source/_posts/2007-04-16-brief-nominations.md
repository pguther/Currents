<p>
  Nominations for Regents' professors and lecturers are now being sought, with screening to begin with applications received by May 11.
</p>
<p>
  The Regents' lecturers and professors program is designed to bring distinguished individuals, ordinarily from nonacademic careers, to the university. Regents' lecturers serve for less than a quarter but more than two weeks, and Regents' professors serve for a quarter or an academic year. Nominations should originate from academic units rather than individuals.
