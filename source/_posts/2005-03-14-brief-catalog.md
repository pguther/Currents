  With the concurrence of both academic and administrative units, UCSC published the first two-year (biennial) edition of its printed course catalog in 2004--<a href="http://reg.ucsc.edu/catalog/"><i>UC Santa Cruz General Catalog, 2004-06</i></a><i>.</i> Previously, the catalog had been printed on an annual basis.

  <img align="right" height="231" src="../art/catalog_cover.180.jpg" width="180" alt="">Although the catalog will not be printed again until summer 2006, an online catalog update will be posted this summer to reflect significant changes affecting the 2005-06 academic year. As stated in the original <a href="http://reg.ucsc.edu/catalog/pdf/Biennial%20Catalog%20Powerpoint.pdf">proposal for a biennial catalog,</a> this interim-year update will communicate important changes to programs, courses, fees, and admission and graduation requirements, as well as other significant changes.
</p>
<p>
  The <a href="http://reg.ucsc.edu/catalog/"><i>2004-06 General Catalog</i></a> will remain archived, as published, online in both PDF and HTML formats. Because the HTML version of the archived catalog contains live links to office, division, research unit, departmental, and other web pages, all units are encouraged to keep their respective web sites as up-to-date and accurate as possible.
