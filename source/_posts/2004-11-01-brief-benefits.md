Open Enrollment for 2005 is from November 1 through November 30. Complete information on benefits options and how to make changes is available at <http://atyourservice.ucop.edu/open_enrollment/index.html>

During Open Enrollment you may transfer to a different medical or dental plan; enroll in the legal plan; enroll or re-enroll in DepCare and HCRA; add eligible family members; opt in or out of UC-sponsored medical, dental, vision plans, and/or TIPS.

Employee premiums for the medical plans that UCSC employees participate in will remain at 2004 levels.
