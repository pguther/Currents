The book is a compilation of success stories epitomizing management and leadership strategies from developing nations around the globe. It focuses on library administrators from Asia, Africa, Eastern Europe, and Central America who have significantly transformed their library services in spite of limited funds and a lack of resources. The book represents a body of practical experience, problems, lessons, and techniques that can be shared and tried by others dealing with the special needs and circumstances of librarians in developing countries.
