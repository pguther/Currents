Bach's _Brandenburg _Concerto No. 5, sponsored by Sonoma State University at Holy Family Church in Rohnert Park. She also performed harpsichord pieces from the _Notebook for Anna Magdalena Bach._

Burman-Hall, artistic director of the Santa Cruz Baroque Festival, is entering her 33rd year of directing concerts of early chamber music played on original instruments.
