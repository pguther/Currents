  <img align="right" alt="United Way logo" border="0" height="137" src="../art/united_way.99-11-01.gif" width="288">Encouraged by the UCSC community's record giving last year, United Way volunteers hope even more faculty and staff will support local seniors, homelesss people, children at risk, disabled people, and families in crisis. Last year, faculty and staff gave more than $80,000 during the United Way campaign, earning the campus the agency's Gold Award.<br>
  <br>
  This year's drive is getting under way this month, and volunteers in every campus unit are distributing information on how to give. Staff and faculty who wish to participate have the option of offering a one-time voluntary contribution by check or arranging a payroll deduction. Donations can be made to United Way or to any nonprofit agency in the county. Pledges are due by November 30.<br>
  <br>
  One out of every two Santa Cruz residents has received assistance from one of the 35 local nonprofits served by United Way, according to the agency. For more information, go to <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/united-way/">www2.ucsc.edu/united-way/</a> or call campaign coordinator Marlene Olson at (831) 459-5360.
