Money for several UCSC projects was included in Proposition 47, the Kindergarten-University Public Education Facilities Bond Act, which was approved by California voters on November 5.  

The state bond measure providing $13 billion for school facilities was passed by a 59 - to 41-percent margin.

UCSC's share of the bond will be nearly $40 million over two years. Among the projects to be funded are construction of the Humanities and Social Sciences Facility, Emergency Response Center, and seismic corrections. Also covered would be planning money for a McHenry Library addition.
