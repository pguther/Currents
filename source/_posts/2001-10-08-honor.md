**Gala reception Oct. 12 honors faculty members, books**

So, what book most influenced you? _The Bible? The Principia? Beyond Good and Evil? Moby Dick? The Politics of Ecstasy? Death on the Installment Plan? Winnie the Pooh? The Mad Reader?_

Nearly everybody can point to at least one volume that made a lasting impression on them. A book that precipitated a personal epiphany, sparked a revolution in consciousness, or just made a memorable read.

Not surprisingly, the faculty of the Jack Baskin School of Engineering have their own favorite tomes and a gala reception on October 12 at 3:30 p.m. in the Science Library will honor selected faculty members and their favorite books.  
  
The UCSC libraries and the Jack Baskin School of Engineering are jointly sponsoring the Honored Faculty, Honored Books Program, recognizing the achievements of faculty in the school who have attained tenure and/or promotion.

The event will celebrate the scholar and a book each selects as having most influenced him or her as a scientist and educator. The honored book will be added to the library collection and inscribed with a personalized bookplate in the faculty member's honor.   
  
Free parking will be available in the parking garage after 3 p.m. on the day of the event. A [web site][1] showcases the selected titles and faculty, along with their description of the significance of the book to their lives and careers.**
