Creating and maintaining peaceful dialogue on the complex issues of the Middle East is the goal of a series of events on campus during the week of November 4-8.  

"UCSC Israeli-Palestinian Dialogue: Perspectives on the Conflict," includes events each night at 7 p.m. at the Colleges Nine and Ten Dining Hall. The programs are part of "Hate Bias Awareness Week, Deconstructing the Cycle of Prejudice," which includes workshops, discussions, and a film screening.

A complete schedule of the awareness week's events is available [online.][1]   

For the Israeli-Palestinian series, speakers and panel discussions will offer viewpoints of those involved in the conflict, including Palestinians (Muslims and Christians) and Israelis/Jews, as well as perspectives from other religions and cultures of the region and the world community.   

The events will be facilitated by UCSC faculty members Dana Takagi, associate professor of sociology, John Brown Childs, a professor of sociology; and David Anthony, associate professor of history.  

Speakers are scheduled to address the forces within their cultures that promote peace and dialogue and those forces within their traditions that promote conflict and violence. A main focus of the series will be on conflict resolution, active listening, and promoting an understanding of the many sides of this conflict.   

Each night's program will have a different emphasis.  

**Monday:** "Origins and Current Views of the Conflict," with Khalil Barhoum and David Meir-Levi, moderated by Dana Takagi.  

**Tuesday:** "Palestinian Perspectives: Muslim, Christian, Secular," with Hatem Bazian, Father Labib Kobti, and an additional speaker to be announced later, moderated by John Brown Childs.  

**Wednesday:** "Israeli Perspectives with Semha Alwaya, Amichai Magen, David Pine, and Raphael Danziger," moderated by John Brown Childs  

**Thursday:** "Possible Solutions & Interfaith Perspectives with Khalil Barhoum, Yitzhak Santis, and an interfaith panel, moderated by David Anthony.  

**Friday:** Middle East hospitality gathering. The emphasis will be on the cultures of the Middle East, and feature cuisine, music, and dance.   

Cosponsoring the series are the UCSC University Religious Council (including the Muslim Student Association and Santa Cruz Hillel); the Center for Global, International and Regional Studies; College Nine and College Ten; Jewish Studies Program; Center for Justice, Tolerance, and Community; Resource Center for Nonviolence; Ad Hoc Committee on Current Events; The Hate/Bias Peer Response Team; and the Committee for the Advancement of Religious Studies.
