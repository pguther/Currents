Panel of local physicians kicks off Health Sciences Speaker Series  
  
A panel of practicing physicians will discuss careers in health care this week in the first presentation in a new Health Sciences Speaker Series. The series is geared primarily toward premed students and others considering careers in health care, but all members of the campus community are welcome to attend.  

"Is a Physician's Lifestyle Right for You?" will take place from 10 to 11:30 a.m. on Wednesday, January 21, in Room 221, Interdisciplinary Sciences Building. The panelists are ophthalmologist Robert L. Block, M.D., O.P.H.; toxicologist and emergency room doctor Alan Buchwald, M.D.; family physician Catherine Sonquist Forest, M.D., M.P.H.; and OB/GYN Martina Nicholson, M.D.  

The lecture series is presented by the Department of Molecular, Cell, and Developmental Biology in association with the Santa Cruz County Medical Society.   

UCSC established a new health sciences major last year as part of an initiative to better serve students interested in careers in health care. Caroline Berger, health sciences internship coordinator, said she was gratified by the response from the local health care community when she began organizing the new lecture series.  

"There are so many doctors in the local community who want to speak to students and make connections with the campus, it's been very exciting to make contact with them," she said.  

Additional presentations in the series are scheduled for February 11 and March 5. For more information, contact Caroline Berger at [cberger@biology.ucsc.edu][3].
