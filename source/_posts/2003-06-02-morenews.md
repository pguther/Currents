UC and UPTE reach tentative agreement on a contract

The University of California has reached tentative agreement with the University Professional and Technical Employees union on two new labor contracts for UC research support professionals and technical employees. Full text of [UCOP press release][6].

Key issues were wages and options for laid-off employees. The tentative agreements allow employees to choose either a full severance package in lieu of preferential rehire/recall rights (similar to the policy currently being proposed to UC's non-unionized staff) or a "combination" package containing some (less-than-full) severance pay and limited preferential rehire/recall rights.

Campus web site features maps to common destinations  

![][9]Visitors to the UCSC campus now have a new resource to help them find their way, not only to their intended destination, but also to the nearest parking lot. The campus map web site (<http://maps.ucsc.edu>) now features a "Common Destinations" link that takes users to a series of downloadable maps. Each map includes an overall view of the campus, with a specific destination, path of travel, and nearest parking highlighted; a close-up view of each destination, showing nearby buildings and the closest handicap parking spaces; and a narrative describing how best to get there, including details about parking options.  

"Common Destinations" maps are available for the Classroom Unit, East Field, Kresge Town Hall, Lower West Field, Music Center, Theater Arts, Quarry Amphitheater, Shakespeare Santa Cruz, and University Center.  

"These maps should be a big help to campus visitors," says Susan Willats, manager of the campus map project. Willats worked with Graphic Services staff to create the new maps and put them on the web site in time for graduation ceremonies. "Last June we had over 3,500 visitors to the map web site, so it was important to have this new feature up and running by the end of May."   

Suggestions for additional "Common Destinations" maps are welcome; please contact Susan Willats at the BAS Office of Planning and Analysis (831) 459-3759 or [willats@ucsc.edu][10].
