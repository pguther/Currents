The local folk trio Mariposa will headline this year's UC Santa Cruz Harvest Festival, a family-oriented afternoon of music, events for children, and tasty edibles. Mark the changing of the seasons at the Farm on Saturday, October 13, from 1-5 p.m. General admission is $3; admission is free for children 12 and under and members of the Friends of the UCSC Farm & Garden.

Activities for children include crafts, face painting, pumpkin decorating, and hayrides. Delicious food will be for sale, and fresh-squeezed apple juice will be available for tasting. Farm-grown pumpkins and other fresh organic produce will be available for purchase, as will UCSC Friends of the Farm & Garden merchandise, including aprons, cookbooks, and T-shirts. Gardeners will have opportunities to soak up information, and local environmental groups will have booths set up.  
  
The festival is cosponsored by the Friends of the UCSC Farm & Garden and the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems. Funds raised at the Harvest Festival support the scholarship and public education work of the Friends of the UCSC Farm & Garden.   
  
The Farm is 1/4 mile up the gravel road above the Blacksmith Shop; free public parking is available in designated areas.  
  
For more information about the festival, call (831) 459-3240 or visit the Center [web site][1].
