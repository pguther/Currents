#### New executive director of Society for Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science to strengthen ties with UCSC

Ronaldo Ramirez, who has been special assistant to Vice Chancellor Francisco Hernandez, has been selected as executive director of the [Society for Advancement of Chicanos and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS][1]). SACNAS is a national organization that encourages Chicano/Latino and Native American students to pursue graduate education and obtain the advanced degrees necessary for research careers and science teaching professions at all levels. SACNAS membership is composed of science professors, industry scientists, K-12 teachers, and undergraduate and graduate students.

The campus has a long-standing connection with SACNAS. Professor Emeritus Eugene Cota-Robles was a founding member; Professor Frank Talamantes served as a former president; Professors Leo Ortiz and Marta Zuniga have served as board members; and former professors Clifton Poodry and Victor Rocha have also been active in the organization. "As I move into my new position I hope to continue to strengthen the long-standing ties between SACNAS and the Santa Cruz campus," said Ramirez.

As executive director, Ramirez will represent SACNAS nationally to its constituents, provide staff leadership, develop new grant initiatives, and play a key role in fund- raising. He begins his new position on January 18.

#### Public talk and exhibit of photos on rural India

While conducting research for her dissertation in environmental sociology, Lisa Bunin traveled to central India to study the re-emergence of organic cotton farming. Farmers in the Nimar and Vidarblha regions who had embraced the "Green Revolution" in the 1960s, became disenchanted with chemical-intensive agriculture by the mid- 1980s and sought new ways to farm without toxic chemicals, drawing on a mix of historical local knowledge and field experiments. Bunin chronicles her research on these farming communities in an exhibit, titled "Organic Cotton: A Developing Story in Rural India," on display at the Bridge Gallery at Porter College through January 16. There will be a reception and a public talk by Bunin on January 13 at 7 p.m. at the gallery. For more information, call Lisa Bunin at (831) 425-7121.
