  A celebration of the life of Myrna Fabbri, former library budget director, will be held in the La Feliz Room at the Seymour Center on Sunday, January 28, from 1:30 to 4:30 pm.
</p>
<p>
  Myrna passed away peacefully on November 14 following a two-year struggle with her health. She had worked at the library for 26 years prior to her retirement in December 2003.

<p>
  Over the years, Myrna served on various UCSC committees including the Management Information Systems Committee, ProCard Advisory Committee, a Diversity Discussion Group, and Women in Management. For several years she spearheaded a campus holiday toy drive for children of migrant farm workers. Following the 1989 earthquake, she spent untold hours documenting the library's losses for FEMA, even though her own home was damaged.

  Myrna was an ardent music lover, a scintillating conversationalist, and a voracious reader. Anyone wishing to make a donation to the proposed "Myrna Fabbri Reading Room" in the McHenry Expansion should contact Margaret Gordon at (831) 459-4211.
