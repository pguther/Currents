  Tickets now available for all events
</p>
<p>
  The new UCSC 2004-05 Arts &amp; Lectures season will open with a blast of pure southern gusto on October 8 at the Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium.
</p>
<p>
  The Grammy award-winning sextet, BeauSoleil--described by <i>Prairie Home Companion's</i> Garrison Keillor as "simply the best Cajun band in the world"--will join forces with Louisiana's legendary Preservation Hall Jazz Band for a rollicking opening night double bill of New Orleans jazz, zydeco, country, and blues.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "It should be an incredibly high-energy night," noted Arts &amp; Lectures director Michelle Witt, "with lots of dancing to some of the finest musicians around. It's really hard to beat a show that combines the best of New Orleans jazz with the country's most popular Cajun ensemble."<br>
</p>
<p>
  But that's only the beginning of a diverse series of 18 events ranging from classical and world music, to modern dance, spoken word, and theater. The season runs through May 5 at various venues throughout Santa Cruz County.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "It's very much a mix of fine arts and popular culture," Witt observed. "We also try to combine mediums as much as possible; we often present a number of different styles in the same program."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Highlights of the 2004-05 season include appearances by three of the country's top dance companies. The mind-boggling Pilobolus Dance Theater will showcase a new commissioned work, <i>Megawhat,</i> along with the wildly imaginative and extremely athletic repertoire that has made this modern dance company so popular throughout the world.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Pioneering avant-garde choreographer Trisha Brown's dance company will also perform a newly commissioned work, <i>Present Tense,</i> set to John Cage's <i>Pieces for Prepared Piano,</i> as well as <i>Set &amp; Reset</i> with sets and score by renowned artist Robert Rauschenberg. And the always innovative dancer/illusionists of Momix Dance Theater will offer founder Moses Pendleton's <i>Baseball</i>--a multimedia tribute to America's national pastime featuring music by James Brown, Loreena McKennitt, and Ali Farka Toure--on the weekend prior to the opening of this year's baseball season.<br>
</p>
<p>
  A brilliant new solo show by HBO, Showtime, and Comedy Central veteran Marga Gomez; a lecture by Chuck D, cofounder of the legendary rap group Public Enemy and now host of a new morning show on Air America Radio; and a tribute to the late monologist Spalding Gray are just a few of the more unusual events slated for the coming months.<br>
</p>
<p>
  There is more, however, to UCSC's Arts &amp; Lectures program than just a multitude of great shows.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "Nearly every artist who comes is doing some kind of educational outreach in the community," Witt noted. "This might involve offering master classes, conducting lecture/demonstrations, or holding open rehearsals with dance and theater companies."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Witt added that there will also be an opening night postconcert party for Gold Circle and Arts &amp; Lectures members--including food and wine with members of BeauSoleil and the Preservation Hall Jazz Band--as well as wine receptions for members during intermission at selected events throughout the season. In addition, question-and-answer sessions will be open to the entire audience after almost every show.<br>
</p>
<p>
  "We have really wonderful conversations between the performers and our audiences," she observed. "People always stay and get involved, and the artists love it."<br>
</p>
