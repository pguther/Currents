The University Continuing Education Association (UCEA) has selected UCSC's [Science Illustration Certificate Program][1] to receive the organization's Outstanding Program Award for 2006. The award recognizes programs for excellence in achieving their educational objectives.

"This award is great public acknowledgment for what we already knew was an outstanding program," said Cathy Sandeen, vice provost and dean of University Extension.

Sandeen and program director Ann Caudle will accept the award in April at the UCEA's annual conference in San Diego.

The Science Illustration Program, offered through UCSC Extension, is one of the most prestigious programs of its kind in the nation. The one-year graduate-level program prepares students to pursue a career in scientific illustration, and also serves scientists who wish to acquire the skills to illustrate their research.

"We get applicants from all over the world, and our students have been very successful in their careers," Caudle said.

The work of graduates from the program can be found in an extraordinary range of publications and institutions, including at museums and science centers such as the Smithsonian Institution and the American Museum of Natural History; in top science magazines such as _National Geographic, Scientific American, Natural History_, and _Audubon_; and at zoos, aquaria, and botanical gardens such as the National Zoo in Washington, D.C., the Monterey Bay Aquarium, and the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew (U.K.).
