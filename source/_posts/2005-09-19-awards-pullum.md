<p>
  Linguistics professor Geoffrey Pullum has been selected as a 2005-06 fellow by the Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study. He is one of 51 people selected for the yearlong fellowship. While at Radcliffe, the fellows--among them 10 creative artists, 16 humanists, 13 social scientists, and 12 scientists working on projects ranging from issues in higher education, to cancer treatments, to installation art on the theme of loss--will work individually and across disciplines on projects chosen both for quality and long-term impact.
</p>
<p>
  Pullum will work with James Rogers, a computational and mathematical linguist and a professor of computer science at Earlham College, and Barbara Scholz, a philosopher of language and lecturer in philosophy at San Jose State University, to complete a book, "New Logical Foundations for Linguistics," on model-theoretic syntax, a new framework for linguistic theory grounded in formal logic and applied to problems in syntactic theories.
