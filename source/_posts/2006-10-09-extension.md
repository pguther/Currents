  UCSC Extension has received an award for "Outstanding Administrative Service or Process" from the University Continuing Education Association (UCEA). The award recognizes UCSC Extension for innovation in organizational design in the complete restructuring of its program support team. Cathy Sandeen, vice provost and dean of extension, accepted the award at the annual UCEA Region West conference on September 28.

  The restructuring was an organization-wide effort undertaken to streamline operations, improve efficiencies, and reduce operational costs. Separate academic program departments were eliminated and a pooled program support team was created, which provides better cross-training and backup for vacations or other leave. The restructuring allows UCSC Extension to provide broad access to key information, which has streamlined and standardized processes and procedures while reducing costs and enabling the support staff to facilitate greater teamwork and collaboration across programs. Staff also have more variety in their jobs and better career-advancement opportunities than before.
