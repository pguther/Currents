Nomy Lamm, a leading activist in the fat liberation movement, will deliver a lecture at UCSC on Wednesday, November 10, at 7 p.m. Her talk, "It's a Big, Fat Revolution!" will take place in Classroom Unit 2 and is free and open to the public. Lamm is a self-described "fat freaky disabled anarchist jew dyke," as well as a freelance writer, lecturer, and performance artist. She lives in Olympia, Washington, and is a graduate of Evergreen State College. Named one of _Ms._ magazine's "Women of the Year" in 1997 for her work fighting fat oppression, Lamm recently released her first full-length CD of music and spoken word on Olympia's Talent Show Recordings. Her writings have appeared in numerous anthologies, including _Adios, Barbie: Young Women Write About Body Image and Identity_ and _Listen Up: Voices from the Next Feminist Generation._ Her articles have appeared in magazines such as _Ms., Seventeen,_ and _HUES._ Lamm spent the past summer touring with Sister Spit, the San Francisco-based all-girl spoken-word road show. She is currently writing a full-length rock opera that will premiere next July. Lamm's visit is being cosponsored by the UCSC Women's Center and the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender Resource Center. For more information, contact the UCSC Women's Center at (831) 459-2291.
