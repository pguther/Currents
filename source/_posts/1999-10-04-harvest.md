  Shorter days and falling leaves are sure signs that autumn is on its way, and one of the annual highlights of the season is the UCSC Harvest Festival, a family-oriented day of fun that will take place this year on Saturday, October 9, from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.
</p>The musical festivities begin at 11:30 a.m. when Dance Around Molly takes the stage to entertain with their authentic Irish tunes. They will be followed by Mariposa, a local folk group enjoyed by grown ups and kids alike, and then Later Alligator, playing lively Cajun music that's sure to have the crowd on its feet.
<p>
  Other highlights include crafts for the kids, workshops, tasty food, and tours of the UCSC Farm. (See <a href="schedule.html">detailed schedule</a>)
</p>
<p>
  Ongoing activities for children include crafts, face painting, pumpkin decorating, gardening activities, and hayrides. Delicious food will be for sale, and fresh-squeezed apple juice will be available for tasting. In addition, fresh organic produce, including pumpkins, will be available for purchase, as will dried-flower wreaths and UCSC Friends of the Farm &amp; Garden merchandise, including aprons, coffee mugs, and T-shirts.
</p>
<p>
  As always, gardeners will have a field day with opportunities to soak up information about native plants, seed saving, garden-fresh cooking, and the benefits chickens and turkeys offer home gardens. Local community organizations will have booths set up, and a display of rare-breed chickens and turkeys is bound to be a crowd pleaser.
</p>
<p>
  Admission to the festival is $3; admission is free for children 12 and under and members of the Friends of the UCSC Farm &amp; Garden, which is cosponsoring the event with the Center for Agroecology and Sustainable Food Systems.
</p>
<p>
  The Farm is located 1/4 mile up the gravel road above the Blacksmith Shop; free public parking is available across the street from the Blacksmith Shop in the Physical Plant parking lot.
</p>
