In looking back over a year of theater, _San Francisco Chronicle_ theater critic Steven Winn named the **Shakespeare Santa Cruz** production of _Arms and the Man_ as one of the best ten productions in the region for 1999. The play was directed by theater arts professor **Paul Whitworth** who, Winn said, "confidently mastered (George Bernard) Shaw's satiric study of military muddlers with one of the region's most sparkling classic productions of the year."  

The _Santa Cruz County Sentinel_ ran an item about UCSC's role in NASA's Gamma ray Large Area Space Telescope, mentioning astronomer **Stephen Thorsett** and the Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics (SCIPP).

The **UCSC Orchestra and Chamber Singers**, conductor **Nicole Paiement**, and pianist **Maria Ezerova** all received a glowing review from the music critic at the _Santa Cruz County Sentinel_ following a recent performance. The critic wrote that they proved "classical music is flourishing on 'the hill.'" The critic went on to describe Ezerova as "amazingly powerful" with "fire and flair."

In a story on a forthcoming California Agricultural Workers History Center in Watsonville, the _Santa Cruz County Sentinel_ named **Geoffrey Dunn** of community studies as one of two local historians who helped envision and solidify the concept for the project, which was approved unanimously by the Watsonville City Council.
