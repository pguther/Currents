  The recipients of the 2004 Milam-McGinty-Kaun Award for Distinguished Teaching were announced by interim Social Sciences Dean Michael Hutchison at the division's recent annual breakfast meeting.

  Ralf Hepp and Alejandra Kramer received the award in recognition of their outstanding teaching. Hepp is a doctoral candidate in economics and a three-time recipient of a teaching award offered to graduate students by the Economics Department. Kramer is a doctoral candidate in anthropology.

  Named after David Kaun, the professor of economics who endowed the award, and the first recipients, Garrett Milam and Matt McGinty, the award honors graduate students in the fields of anthropology, economics, education, environmental studies, politics, psychology, and sociology. Each year, one recipient from economics and one student in another field receive $1,000 each.

  Kaun established the award in 2000 with a $50,000 gift to the campus. Milam and McGinty were teaching assistants in Kaun's <i>Intermediate Microeconomic Theory</i> course
