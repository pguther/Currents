The theater was packed and the audience let out a roaring cheer as last week's special late-morning performance of _Cinderella_ began. The audience of nearly 500 youngsters from regional schools was treated to the show by UCSC as part of the campus's ongoing effort to expose young children to the educational and cultural opportunities of college.

The show was a resounding hit.

"If I were the president, I would let everyone see _Cinderella_ for free," said Jose Cervantes, a seventh grader from Markham Middle School in San Jose.

His classmate Jose Magana also gave the show his seal of approval. "I loved seeing a professional show like this one," he said. "It's the first I have been to, and I would like to take my mom and dad back to see it, too."

Students from schools in Watsonville, Moss Landing, Castroville, and San Jose attended the show, which was one of two free performances of _Cinderella_ that Shakespeare Santa Cruz offers each season to make the arts and theater experience available to a wider audience.

The Early Academic Outreach Program (EAOP) was founded on the belief that experiencing the college environment at a young age makes a lasting impression and can help motivate students to prepare for and pursue a college education. A majority of the students who attended the performance participate year-round in EAOP programs at their schools. The EAOP is administered by UCSC's Educational Partnership Center (EPC).

The EPC organized the trip, and the cost of tickets was covered by J. Michael Thompson, associate vice chancellor for outreach, admissions, and student academic services, and Carrol Moran, director of the EPC. The center and EAOP sponsored meals and transportation for the event.
