Watsonville's sister city delegation from Pinghu, China, got a good look at an American university September 1 during a breakfast visit to University House followed by a campus tour.

Acting Chancellor George Blumenthal welcomed the group, headed by Pinghu executive vice mayor Hu Shui Liang, to the campus.

Blumenthal noted that UCSC faculty are now collaborating with Chinese researchers on 130 research projects and that as a faculty member he wrote papers with Chinese astronomers.

Joining the delegation at the breakfast were Watsonville mayor Antonio Rivas, Cabrillo College president Brian King, and members of the Cabrillo College Board of Trustees.

UCSC representatives included history professor Gail Hershetter, whose area of expertise includes modern Chinese social and cultural history; Kevin Browne, executive director of admissions and registrar and part of a UC delegation to China this summer; and David Keller, assistant director of residential and family services, also part of the UC delegation.
