### **New U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy hears from UCSC researchers**

Members of the new presidentially appointed U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy visited the Monterey Bay last week and heard presentations from UCSC marine scientists and others on coastal marine protection, sanctuaries and reserves, ocean research and technology, and other ocean issues affecting California.  
  
Gary Griggs, director of the Institute of Marine Sciences, helped organize the visit and spoke to the commission about issues such as coastal erosion. He also discussed the value of partnerships between the university and federal agencies, such as the National Marine Fisheries Service.   
  
Mark Carr, associate professor of ecology and evolutionary biology, discussed the science of marine reserves in his presentation to the commission. Other speakers included Bill Douros, superintendent of the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary, and Julie Packard, executive director of the Monterey Bay Aquarium.

On April 18 and 19, the full commission gathered at the Cabrillo Marine Aquarium in San Pedro, Calif., to hold its southwest regional meeting on the wide range of ocean and coastal issues affecting California. The southwest meeting is the fourth of nine stops for the 16-member commission, which is conducting similar site visits and public meetings in the nation's coastal regions over the next six months.   
  
The Commission will be compiling recommendations for the development of a comprehensive federal ocean policy. The commission's findings and recommendations will be presented to Congress and the president in a final report in the spring of 2003.

### Donate your old cell phone for a good cause

Did you know that last year people replaced or threw away 30,000,000 cell phones? Help the Granary Child Development Center turn that waste into new playground equipment. As one element of a fundraising program, the center is collecting and recycling old and out-of-service cell phones in exchange for points that can be exchanged for new playground equipment. The current drop-off location is at the Granary, located at the base of campus.  
  
The Granary has had great success with a similar program collecting and recycling empty ink and laser cartridges. In the fall quarter of last year, the center received over 3,700 points (equivalent to $1,300) toward playground equipment. The center would like to thank the campus community for its support and encourage everyone to continue donating used cartridges. ([List of supporters][8])
