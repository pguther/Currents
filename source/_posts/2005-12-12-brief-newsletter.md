<p>
  The University of California has a new newsletter for UC faculty, staff, and students who are balancing academic goals or careers with family life. Called <a href="http://parents.berkeley.edu/ucfamilies/">UC Families</a>, the newsletter is web-based and parent-run and comes out about twice a month. In addition, the UC Families home page provides resources for families on UC campuses, UC-wide policy and benefits information, and archives of past advice and discussions.
</p>
<p>
  Subscribers to UC Families can post questions or engage in discussions on topics such as managing work and family responsibilities, planning the optimal time to start a family, finding advice on progressing academically as a student parent, returning to academia after having a baby, or advocating for flexible work arrangements.
</p>
<p>
  UC Families is the most recent newsletter addition to the <a href="http://parents.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley Parents Network</a>, a no-fee Bay Area parent-to-parent advice newsletter serving 12,000 families. It is also a collaboration with the <a href="http://ucfamilyedge.berkeley.edu/ucfamilyfriendlyedge.html">UC Faculty Family Friendly Edge</a> initiative, designed to develop and implement a comprehensive package of innovative work-family policies and programs for ladder-rank faculty in the UC system.
