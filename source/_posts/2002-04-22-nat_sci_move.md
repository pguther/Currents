  Beginning this month, many units in the Natural Sciences Division will be relocated. The first move will involve relocating the Dean's Office to the Natural Sciences Annex (formerly the UCO/Lick Administrative Offices). As of April 15 the Natural Sciences Annex will house the following units:<br>
  <br>
  Natural Sciences Dean's Office:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>David Kliger, Dean
  </li>
  <li>Kathleen Jefferds, Assistant Dean
  </li>
  <li>Charlotte Moreno, Assistant Dean
  </li>
  <li>Edie Dahlberg, Executive Asst. to the Dean
  </li>
  <li>Vege Clerisse, Office Manager
  </li>
  <li>Marlene Robinson, Outreach and Curriculum Coordinator
  </li>
  <li>Kathie Kenyon, Management Services Officer
  </li>
  <li>Barbra Parees, Planning and Resources Analyst
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Natural Sciences Development Office:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Lynne Stoops, Director of Development, Nat. Sci.
  </li>
  <li>Sarah Schuster, Assistant Director of Development, Nat. Sci.
  </li>
  <li>Karen Fry, Assistant Director of Development, Nat. Sci.
  </li>
  <li>Paula Schneider, Development Assistant, Nat. Sci.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Phone numbers for the Natural Sciences Dean's Office and Development Office will remain the same.<br>
  <br>
  The Natural Sciences Academic Personnel Unit will soon be moving to the Natural Sciences Business Office, located in the Baskin Engineering Building. This is designed to further the reorganization initiated last year to consolidate the Staff and Academic personnel units into one payroll/personnel unit. Several of our business units are also slated to move over the next few months. We will keep you updated as plans are finalized.<br>
  <br>
  Additional moves are planned through August, with the goal to complete all of the moves before the beginning of the fall quarter. The academic units scheduled to move are the Astronomy and Astrophysics Department, the Physics Department, the Santa Cruz Institute for Particle Physics, the Mathematics Department, and the Science Communication Program. Several academic support units are also scheduled to move: The Academic Excellence Program (ACE), Biology Advising, Health Sciences Advising and two members of the Academic Computing Group.<br>
  <br>
  Please bear with us as this will be an extremely busy time for all of us who are impacted, as well as for our Facilities staff members.<br>
  <br>
  Sincerely,<br>
  <br>
  David S. Kliger, Dean
