Shakespeare Santa Cruz (SSC) has just announced the lineup for its 2003 Summer Festival. Noel Coward's _Private Lives_ will join Shakespeare's _Hamlet_ and _The Comedy of Errors_ for a six-week run from July 15 to August 24 on the UCSC campus.

"This is a season of the classics, entertaining plays that have shaped how we look at the world," noted Managing Director Marcus Cato. "These are all must-see plays."

_Private Lives,_ Coward's stylish and hilarious examination of love and marriage, kicks off the repertory season at the UCSC Mainstage. Directed by Kent Gash, this elegant and sharp-witted comedy will also feature Jonathan Brody at the piano singing Noel Coward songs.   

Confusion, chaos, and comedy will ensue when Shakespeare's lively story of two sets of twins, _The Comedy of Errors,_ hits SSC's Festival Glen. Director William Partlan celebrates Santa Cruz by setting this production in our very own locale.

UCSC's unparalleled outdoor theater will also be the scene of Shakespeare's great psychological masterpiece, _Hamlet, _ directed by SSC Artistic Director Risa Brainin.   

"Shakespeare Santa Cruz is one of the few repertory companies in the country," Cato observed. "The fun of 'rep' is in seeing the same actors in two different roles--sometimes in the same day--or seeing the Festival Glen in two completely different moods. The plays reflect off each other, offering new and surprising insights."  

SSC will also offer a newly commissioned world premiere of _The Emperor's New Clothes_ for its holiday shows in November and December. Based on the Hans Christian Anderson fairy tale, this production will also be directed by Brainin.
