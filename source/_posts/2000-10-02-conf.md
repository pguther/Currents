Some kind of text here.Daniel Koshland Jr., professor of biochemistry and molecular biology at UC Berkeley, will speak on "Stereoselectivity in Enzymology and Toxicology." Ellen Silbergeld, professor of epidemiology, pathology, and toxicology at the University of Maryland Medical School, will speak on "Mercury Poisoning and Malaria: New Connections Between Ancient Diseases."   
  
Koshland has made innumerable contributions to science and has received many awards, including the National Medal of Science. His induced fit theory is one of the most important conceptual advances in biochemistry and has led to new understandings of enzyme action and the control and regulation of biological systems. He continues his work on the mechanisms by which cells receive and respond to external cues and has shown that bacteria have a rudimentary memory that affects their responses to their environment.
