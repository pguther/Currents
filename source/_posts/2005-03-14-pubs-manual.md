The economics of corporate-dominated food production today make it tough for small-scale farmers to make ends meet. Despite long hours and backbreaking work, they often have little money in the bank.

A new publication by the Center for Agroecology & Sustainable Food Systems (CASFS) focuses on what it takes to make small-scale farming economically viable, offering marketing and business-planning guidance, as well as tips on how to pursue "out of the box" ideas like marketing to restaurants.

A compendium of the latest marketing ideas and strategies compiled by instructors in UCSC's highly regarded Farm & Garden Apprenticeship Program, the manual offers lessons to farmers, instructors, and others with direct-marketing outlets, including urban farms, community gardens, and food projects.

The manual covers farm and business planning, selling at farmers' markets, direct marketing at a roadside farm stand, and a full exploration of community-supported agriculture (CSA), which has been a boon to many small growers.

The publication,_ Teaching Direct Marketing and Small Farm Viability: Resources for Instructors_, is a companion volume to CASFS's first training manual, _Teaching Organic Farming and Gardening: Resources for Instructors._

"Growing quality produce is at the heart of farming, but there's much more that goes into making a farm successful over the long term," said CASFS director Carol Shennan. "We saw a real need for a publication that would address the business aspects of farming."

From finding land and planning what crops to grow, to marketing crops and managing farm income and expenses, _Teaching Direct Marketing and Small Farm Viability_ covers it all. Three sections focus on marketing, while other sections cover land-use options, including cash-rent leases from nonprofits, shared ownership models, conservation easements, and community land trusts. A general review of small farm viability is also included.

The manual may be downloaded for free as a PDF from the [CASFS web site][1]. It is also available in print for $25, plus $4 for domestic shipping; please send e-mail to [TrainingManual@ucsc.edu][2] for details on how to order a printed copy.

The manual was made possible by funding from the True North Foundation, the Foundation for Sustainability and Innovation, and the Organic Farming Research Foundation.
