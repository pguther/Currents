<p>
  UCSC's Center for Art &amp; Visual Studies' "Museum without Walls" project will present a lecture by Elizabeth Diller--of the award-winning New York City-based architectural firm <a href="http://www.dillerscofidio.com/">Diller Scofidio + Renfro</a>--on Wednesday, March 7, from 7 to 8 p.m. at College Eight, Room 240.
</p>
<p>
  Diller Scofidio + Renfro recently designed the new Boston Institute of Contemporary Art (ICA), conceiving the building both "from the sky down," as a contemplative space for experiencing contemporary art, and "from the ground up," providing dynamic areas for public enjoyment. Elizabeth Diller has been invited to speak about the ICA design project and to reflect on the design of a dynamic center for the arts at UCSC by offering an informal lecture on the choreography of architecture in relation to landscape.
