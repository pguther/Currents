  The Mineralogical Society of America (MSA) has named professor of earth sciences Quentin Williams the recipient of the MSA Award for 2000. The award recognizes outstanding contributions by young faculty to the fields of mineral physics, mineralogy, and crystallography. Williams studies the physical and chemical properties of minerals and melts under the high pressure and temperature conditions of planetary interiors. He conducts experiments using a range of high-pressure/high-temperature techniques and couples his experimental results with theoretical calculations and seismic observations. Williams is the 50th winner of the MSA award and the eighth from the UC system. More information about the award is available on the <a href="http://www.minsocam.org">MSA's Web site</a>.
