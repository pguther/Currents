The fifth annual UC Management and Leadership (UCML) Conference is scheduled for Sunday, December 10, through Tuesday, December 12, at the historic Hotel Del Coronado in beautiful San Diego. The conference theme is "The Future Legacy: Today's Decision-Makers Build Tomorrow's University."  
  
UC San Diego and the Office of the President invite academic leaders, managers, business officers, campus administrators, health science administrators, principal investigators, department chairs, and other UC professionals to come share ideas and learn new skills with hundreds of other decision-makers from the UC community.   
  
"This conference focuses on the future legacy, and our combined role in shaping the university of tomorrow," said Steven W. Relyea, UCSD vice chancellor for business affairs.

"We have created a program that offers a mix of keynotes, panel discussions, and break-out workshops, not to mention plenty of time for informal idea swapping with your colleagues from around the state."  
  
A total of six plenary sessions will provide attendees the opportunity to hear leading experts address topics and issues of importance to all at UC. In order to maximize learning opportunities for participants, 36 workshops are planned in addition to plenary sessions so attendees can select topics of personal interest. Additionally, two in-depth preconference seminars, one focusing on knowledge transfer and the other on mediation skills, also are scheduled for Sunday, December 10.  
  
"The topics and discussions planned for UCML San Diego reflect the number of pressing issues we all currently face in our daily work," said Mark Cunningham, UCML San Diego conference chair. "However, when planning the conference, we also kept our eye on the future, knowing that the decisions we make today will have a profound impact on the future of our departments, our campuses, and UC overall."  
  
Keynote sessions will address topics ranging from "The Challenges of Student Growth and Student Diversity," presented by Senator Steve Peace, to "Thinking in the Future Tense," presented by author and columnist Jennifer James.

Workshops fall under six general topics and address everything from "Managing the New Worker," to "Writing for the Web," to "Knowledge Management," to "Faculty Start-Up Companies: The Challenges, the Successes."   
  
Registration is by online form only, and is available at the UCML San Diego [web site][1]. The web site also features comprehensive conference information, including descriptions of all plenary and workshop sessions, presenter bios, and accommodations and travel information.   
  
The conference registration fee, including meals, is $395 per person until November 10; afterward, the fee increases to $450. The UCML hotel rate at the Hotel Del Coronado is $159 per night; please note that after November 17, this special room rate is no longer guaranteed.
