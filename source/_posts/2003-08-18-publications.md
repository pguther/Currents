</p>
<p>
  Bruce Bridgeman, professor of psychology and psychobiology, has published a new textbook, <i>Psychology &amp; Evolution: The Origins of Mind</i> (Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage Publications, 2003).<br>
</p>
<p>
  <img align="right" height="188" src="../art/origins.03-08-18.150.jpg" width="150" alt="">Evolutionary psychology, writes Bridgeman, "applies the principles of biological evolution to the great questions of psychology: What are the bases of experience, behavior, mind, and memory, of development and social interaction? Where do they come from, and what are they for?"<br>
</p>
<p>
  Bridgeman uses evolutionary theory to help elucidate the foundations of human perceptions, experiences, and behaviors. Some of the topics addressed in the book include:<br>
</p>
<p>
  * Uses and misuses of evolution<br>
  * Courtship and reproductive adaptations<br>
  * Language development<br>
  * Perception, memory, and consciousness<br>
  * Mental illness<br>
</p>
<p>
  In the "Evolutionary Psychiatry" chapter, Bridgeman writes about addictive drugs: "The evolutionary history of addictive drugs suggests that addicts are not freaks of nature, suffering from some bizarre abnormality, nor are they diseased. They are just relatively normal people faced with a temptation that evolution has not prepared them to handle."<br>
</p>
<p>
  Considered the "long-lost stepchild of the biological sciences," psychology is beginning to take its place as the biological science of human behavior and experience, writes Bridgeman. Given the strides of genetics and molecular biology, it is time to apply this "new biology" to the field of psychology, says Bridgeman, whose book grew out of a seminar on psychology and evolutionary theory he has taught at UCSC since the early 1980s.<br>
