As environmental studies professor Alan Richards begins a two-quarter sabbatical to prepare the third edition of his book _A Political Economy of the Middle East_, the volume has made a list of the "21 Best Books in Middle Eastern Studies" ([full list][1]).

American University in Cairo polled more than 200 academics in the United States, the United Kingdom, Israel, Egypt, and Lebanon to compile the list of "the most interesting, informative, and readable" books in the field."

Richards's book, which he coauthored with John Waterbury, was ranked 12th. Details about the selection process are available in the November 2005 edition of the university's [Middle East Studies newsletter][2].
