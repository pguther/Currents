**Retirement party for Doyle Foreman**

The campus community is invited to a party on September 29 to honor art professor [Doyle Foreman,][1] who retired this summer. The party will be held at the UCSC Women's Center from 4 until 8 p.m. Dan Juma Adamu and his band, Kosono, will play; food and refreshments will be served.

Doyle Forman is primarily a sculptor, although he has also made and screened films and shown drawings. He was one of the founding members and art editor of the _Yardbird Reader,_ a journal of mulitcultural art and writing. He began teaching at UCSC in 1968, and has taught courses in bronze casting, figure sculpture, drawing, and African art. In 1975 he designed and oversaw the building of the bronze foundry on campus, the first official facility for the art department. It is currently the only bronze foundry in the UC system.

**Graduate Commons, Whole Earth Restaurant open**

![][4]With the opening of the new Graduate Student Commons building, which provides a base for graduate students on its second floor and houses the Whole Earth Restaurant on the first floor, the Bay Tree Bookstore plaza area is now complete.   
  
The new Whole Earth Restaurant, pictured right, has added hamburgers and French fries to its menu, and also has some new touches, including a coffee bar, carryout window, and pool table. Large windows are opened to the outdoor seating area whenever weather permits.  
  
With office space a problem for many UCSC graduate students, the commons offers a place where graduate students can check their e-mail, use the phone, hold office hours, socialize with other graduate students,** **conduct review sessions, or just relax between classes. The Graduate Commons facilities manager, Diane Brookes, may be reached at (831) 459-1395. There is also a Graduate Student Commons** [**web site][5] and [e-mail][6] account.

**Metro buses running both directions**

Riding the bus is a little easier now that Metro buses are running in both directions through the campus.** **Up until now, bus service was carrying riders in one direction only, traveling in a counterclockwise direction by way of Hagar Drive to McLaughlin and then to Heller, leaving through the west gate. Metro buses now enter at both the main entrance and the west gate. For a detailed bus schedule and route map, look for the "Come and Go" brochures distributed around campus or visit the [Metro web site.][7]

**Getting the facts gets easier**  
  
A new online service that allows researchers and the public to discover and use government data about California is now available.  
  
Taking advantage of Internet and digital library technologies, the service, called [Counting California][8], enhances public access to the growing range of social science and economic information from government agencies.  
  
Researchers and the public can find current and historical census data, almanac-style statistics, county business data, and a range of education, crime, election, and demographic information from nearly a dozen different sources. The user can also have information mapped or a bar chart produced. The University of California's California Digital Library developed and hosts Counting California with support from state and federal research grants.

#### Wondering what to do with that old monitor?

Don't throw it in the trash. It's now against the law to discard TVs or computer monitors as trash. Recent regulatory changes require these items to be recycled through Campus Surplus (a free service) or disposed of as hazardous waste (expensive). Contact Steve Goldie in Campus Surplus at (831) 459-2852 to arrange for recycling.  
  
For more information, check the [Campus Surplus web page][9] or the [EH&S web page][10], which includes information on what to do with broken or shattered units.

#### Organic produce at the Farm market cart Tuesdays and Fridays

The campus's popular market cart, located at the corner of Bay and High Streets, is overflowing with fresh organic produce and lovely flower bouquets each Tuesday and Friday afternoon from noon until 6 p.m.   
  
The cart is open into the fall. All proceeds benefit the UCSC Center for Agroecology & Sustainable Food Systems' Apprenticeship Program in Ecological Horticulture. For more information, call (831) 459-3248.

#### Staff and faculty mentors sought

The Page and Eloise Smith Scholastic Society is bringing together UCSC alumni, faculty, and staff to serve the educational aspirations of UCSC students who are foster children, wards of the court, and orphans. There will be over 40 of these students on campus this fall. They will receive scholarships from the Page and Eloise Smith Scholastic Society, but they will also need other help.   
  
Can you help someone through the registration process? Could you correspond occasionally via e-mail with a student needing advice about a major? Perhaps you could help a new student connect with just the right faculty member to explore their visions or goals. If you are interested in any level of mentorship relationship with a current student who has been a foster child, ward of the court, or orphan, please contact Lynn Zachreson in the Alumni Office at (831) 459-5842.
