<p>
  The multicultural Rainbow Theater will perform five one-act plays on a range of subjects in late October and early November.<br>
</p>
<p>
  Rainbow Theater, produced and founded by Don Williams, seeks to foster the spirit of unity between races, and to be conscious of current issues and concerns in society. The troupe is in its ninth year.
</p>
<p>
  "We touch upon so many cultures--those whose stories often don't get to be told," said Williams. He said this year's performances include the first play with a South Asian theme, <i>First Seed.</i>
</p>
<p>
  This year's plays are <i>Day of Absence, Food for the Dead, Raunchy Asian Women, First Seed</i>, and <i>Poet's Corner.</i>
</p>
<p>
  Douglas Turner Ward's <i>Day of Absence</i> is a chilling satire about what would happen to life in the South if all the African Americans were to disappear for 24 hours. Turner's depiction of the white South and its dependence on black labor is both stunning and entertaining. Directing is Allyson Evans.
</p>
<p>
  <i>Food for the Dead</i> deals with homosexuality in Mexican American culture in conjunction with family issues that create comedy and drama. Directing are Xavier Alvarez and Raquel Hernandez.
</p>
<p>
  Throughout <i>Raunchy Asian Women,</i> women look for their identity in America, breaking the stereotypes of Asian women. Directing are Kaoru Sunami and Jeremy Aaron Kaffin.
</p>
<p>
  <i>First Seed</i> deals with dual culturalism and domestic violence through the eyes of a South Asian/ Indian American family. The story focuses on an arranged marriage. "It gives us a real insight on the culture we see but very seldom hear," noted Williams. Directing are Aman Gohal and Anand Sha, who also wrote the play together.
</p>
<p>
  <i>Poet's Corner,</i> which is all student-written, includes some improvisational elements, dance and the poety. Directing are Yadira De La Riva, P.J. Johnson, and Peter Jensen.
</p>
<p>
  Ticket prices are $5 for students and $7 for adults, and are available at the door. Audiences should expect mature content and language. All shows will be at 8 p.m.
</p>
<p>
  <i>Day of Absence, Raunchy Asian Women,</i> and <i>The First Seed</i> will be performed October 24 and 26 at Stevenson College Dining Hall, and November 2 at Louden Nelson Community Center, 301 Center Street, Santa Cruz.
</p>
<p>
  <i>Food for the Dead</i> and <i>Poet's Corner</i> will be performed October 25 and 27 at Stevenson College Dining Hall, and November 1 at Louden Nelson.
