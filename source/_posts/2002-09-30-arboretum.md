The UCSC Arboretum is holding its annual Fall Plant Sale on Saturday, October 12, from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. As in previous years, it is a joint sale with the California Native Plant Society (CNPS).

For Arboretum and CNPS members only, the sale starts at 10 a.m. It will take place at the Arboretum's Eucalyptus Grove, on High Street at the intersection with Western Drive.

For gardeners on the Central Coast, fall is an excellent time to get new plants established. The Arboretum offers a wide range of plant selections, including California natives and drought-tolerant plants from Australia and South Africa.

This year's sale will include some new Australian plants introduced by the Koala Blooms partnership. This plant introduction program is structured to return some of the profits to the Australian nurseries that developed the plants and some to the Arboretum, which has imported the plants, grown them in trials, and distributed them to nurseries.

At least two new introductions will be available at this year's sale:

* Chorizema 'Bush Flame' is an evergreen plant with arching to semierect sprays of brilliant orange and pink pea flowers from fall through early spring. It has bright-green, heart-shaped leaves and grows to about 3 feet. It requires good drainage and will grow in full sun to light shade.
* Correa 'Carpenter's Rocks' has bright vermillion-red, bell-shaped flowers with chartreuse tips. It blooms from fall through the spring. Small, heart-shaped, green, shiny leaves clasp the stems. It grows 3 to 4 feet tall and wide and does best in full sun to partial shade in soil with good drainage.

A complete list of the plants available at the Fall Sale will be posted on the Arboretum's [web site][1] at least a week in advance of the sale.

The UCSC Arboretum is open for visitors from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. every day. Norrie's Gifts is open Tuesday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. and Sunday from 1 to 4 p.m. The Jean and Bill Lane Horticultural Library is open Wednesday through Sunday from 12 to 3 p.m. For more information, call (831) 427-2998.
