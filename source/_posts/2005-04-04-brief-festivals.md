The UCSC community is invited to help the city of Santa Cruz launch its General Plan update by participating in one of two "visioning festivals" planned this month (see [flier][1]). The first Cruz to the Future festival will take place this Saturday, April 9, at Branciforte Middle School; the second, on Saturday, April 23, at Bay View Elementary School. Both events will take place between noon and 4 p.m. and will cover the same information. City residents can come at anytime during the event and stay as long as their schedules permit.  
  
The festivals will help to set the guiding principles and vision for the city during the 15-year planning period (through 2020) that will be covered by its next General Plan. Graphic facilitators will be on hand to capture the community's ideas. Entertainment and demonstrations are also planned, as well as other fun activities for children and families.
