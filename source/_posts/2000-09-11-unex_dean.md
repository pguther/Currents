Cathy Sandeen, formerly an assistant dean at UC San Francisco, has been named dean of University Extension/Summer Session. Sandeen begins her appointment on September 11\. "Dr. Sandeen was selected from a field of excellent candidates during a nationwide search, and we are very pleased to have her fill this important position," said Chancellor M.R.C. Greenwood. As dean, Sandeen will oversee both the year-round continuing education programs offered through UCSC Extension and the campus's Summer Session programs. UCSC Extension is the largest provider of professional continuing education in Silicon Valley and the Central Coast, with 55,000 enrollments in the 1999-2000 fiscal year. Sandeen received her Ph.D. in communication from the University of Utah. Since 1990, she has held positions of increasing responsibility with UC San Francisco's School of Dentistry. Since 1997, she has been the school's assistant dean for educational support services, with responsibility for the direction and management of alumni services, student services, and continuing education. Under her direction, the school's continuing education programs have expanded significantly. They presently serve dental professionals in California, in other areas of the United States, and in Pacific Rim countries, and are considered among the top programs of their kind. Dr. Sandeen is active professionally in the area of continuing education through various publications, presentations, and grants. She is a past president of the Association for Continuing Dental Education (1996-1997) and is presently serving as chair of the Section on Continuing Education for the American Association of Dental Schools.[Return to Front Page][1] ![ ][2]
