  Sustainability is the focus of this summer's annual meeting of the <a href="http://www.aabga.org">American Public Garden Association</a> (APGA) in San Francisco, cohosted by the <a href="http://www2.ucsc.edu/arboretum/">UCSC Arboretum</a> in collaboration with the <a href="http://www.filoli.org/">Filoli Center</a> and other regional gardens. The 2006 APGA conference, June 26 to July 1, will showcase the diversity and beauty of greater-Bay Area public gardens and demonstrate the innovative efforts of regional gardens toward sustainability.
</p>
<p>
  Approximately 500 garden professionals from across the country will attend the presentations, workshops, tours, and discussions about the central role of public gardens in the sustainability movement. On Saturday, July 1, hundreds of conference attendees will visit the Arboretum for a tour.
</p>
<p>
  "The Arboretum and its collections and conservation activities are well known in the botanical garden community. The tour will be an opportunity to promote our collections, gardens, and community of friends," said Arboretum director Daniel Harder, who is cochair of the host committee for the APGA conference.

  Conference attendees will also visit the <a href="http://botanicalgarden.berkeley.edu/">UC Botanical Garden</a> in Berkeley and attend events at the <a href="http://www.sfbotanicalgarden.org/">San Francisco Botanical Garden</a>, the <a href="http://www.conservatoryofflowers.org/">Conservatory of Flowers</a>, and the Filoli Center. Additional information about the conference is available on the <a href="http://www.aabga.org">APGA web site</a>.

  Formerly known as the American Association of Botanical Gardens and Arboreta, the APGA represents North American public gardens and their professional staff. The organization serves and strengthens public gardens by supporting their work, value, and achievements in horticultural display, education, research, and plant conservation.
