<p>
  Join a leading expert on nuclear weapons policy for a virtual tour of past and present nuclear weapons installations around the world on Thursday, November 2, at 7 p.m. in the Cowell College Conference Room.
</p>
<p>
  Stephen Schwartz (B.A., politics and sociology, '87) of the Monterey Institute of International Studies will use Google Earth to conduct this unprecedented tour of important historical and current nuclear weapons facilities worldwide.
</p>
<p>
  Members of the campus community and local alumni are invited to attend the virtual tour, "Sites Unseen: A Virtual Tour of Past and Present Nuclear Weapons Installations Worldwide," which will feature digital satellite photographs of weapons laboratories, test sites, major manufacturing factories, and deployment sites, such as missile silos, bomber and submarine bases, and nuclear weapons storage depots.
</p>
<p>
  "With Google Earth, anyone with a computer and high-speed Internet connection can visually explore virtually any part of the Earth and gain access to images that were previously limited to well-funded and highly secretive government agencies," said Schwartz.
</p>
<p>
  As tour guide, Schwartz will discuss the history and importance of each installation and conclude with remarks on how the democratization of intelligence gathering can influence public attitudes toward nuclear weapons.
</p>
<p>
  Schwartz is editor of <i>The Nonproliferation Review</i> published by the Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Monterey Institute of International Studies. He is also the editor and coauthor of <i>Atomic Audit: The Costs and Consequences of U.S. Nuclear Weapons Since 1940</i>, and was formerly the publisher and executive director of the <i>Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists</i>.
