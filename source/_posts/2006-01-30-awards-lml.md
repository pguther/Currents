  Seabirds, sea turtles, and walruses are among the subjects of the 16 student research projects that will be supported this year by the Friends of Long Marine Lab Student Research Awards. The awards will provide a total of $11,000 in research funding for the student projects, which were selected by a proposal review committee.
</p>
<p>
  The award recipients were recognized last week at a special ceremony and reception held at the Seymour Marine Discovery Center. In addition, the Friends of Long Marine Lab will honor the top two student research award recipients--Leslie Roland, a graduate student in ocean sciences, and Dana K. Wingfield, a graduate student in Earth sciences--with a special award to be presented at the annual Global Oceans Gourmet Dinner on March 12 at the Bittersweet Bistro.

  The Friends of LML provides funding for public education, marine mammal programs, and student research, as well as the development and operation of the Seymour Center. The Student Research Awards come from the interest generated by six different endowments: The Jane McHenry Student Awards Fund, the Lillian McPherson Rouse Student Award Fund, the William Baye Heald Scholarship Fund, the Friends of LML Student Support Fund, the Mark T. MacMillan Memorial Prize Fund, and the Ken Norris Marine Mammal Research Award.
