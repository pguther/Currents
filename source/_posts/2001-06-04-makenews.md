**Manuel Pastor's** work on the distribution of toxics in Los Angeles will be featured in an upcoming edition of _California Journal._ And journalism's **Conn Hallinan** has penned another op-ed for the _San Francisco Examiner,_ this one focusing on the risks associated with the brave new world of genetic engineering. . . . Also in the Bay Area, sociologist **Marcia Millman** got a big two-page splash in the Sunday edition of the _San Francisco Chronicle_ for her new book about the parallels between the romantic themes of movies and real-life love stories.

The Santa Cruz Predatory Bird Research Group (SCPBRG) continues to be a media magnet, attracting attention recently from the Discovery Channel and the _San Jose Mercury News._ SCPBRG coordinator **Brian Walton** was quoted in the _Mercury News_ story, which focused on the group's work with a pair of peregrine falcons nesting on the headquarters building of the software company Oracle in Redwood Shores; KRON, CNBC, Tech TV also covered the Oracle story. Oracle executives have been so charmed by the falcons and impressed by the research group's work that the company has donated $25,000 to support the group's public education programs. Meanwhile, a TV crew for the Discovery Channel filmed researcher **Brian Latta** as he rescued peregrine falcon chicks from a perilous nest on the San Francisco Bay Bridge and, several weeks later, released them as fledglings at a winery near Buellton.
