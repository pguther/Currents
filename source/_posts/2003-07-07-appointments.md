Appointments

New provost named for Cowell College, two provosts reappointed

Cowell College will have a new provost, and provosts have been reappointed at College Eight and Kresge College for the 2003-04 academic year. The announcements were made by Lynda Goff, vice provost and dean of undergraduate education.   

Stanley Williamson, professor emeritus of chemistry, has accepted a one-year appointment as provost of Cowell College, effective July 1. He replaces William Ladusaw, professor of linguistics, who was provost for six years. In addition to his duties as professor, Williamson also served for many years as senior academic preceptor at Cowell, and has been very active in Cowell College life for a number of years.  

Andrew Szasz, professor of sociology, will remain as provost of College Eight for the 2003-04 academic year. Szasz will be completing his second three-year term as provost.  

Conn Hallinan, lecturer in journalism, has been reappointed as associate provost of Kresge College. He was originally appointed to a two-year term but, after consultation with the Kresge faculty, Goff appointed him for one more year of service to Kresge.  

"I am delighted to have the opportunity to continue working with Andy Szasz and Conn Hallinan, and am very pleased to welcome Stanley Williamson as UCSC's newest provost," Goff said.
