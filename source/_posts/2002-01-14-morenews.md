### **Earthquake expert to give public lecture January 16**

Ross Stein, a geophysicist with the U.S. Geological Survey's Earthquake Hazards Program, will give a free public lecture at the Seymour Center at Long Marine Laboratory on Wednesday, January 16. The lecture, titled "Living It Up in the Fault Lane, or How Earthquakes Converse," begins at 7:30 p.m.  
  
Stein will discuss his research on the stresses that trigger earthquakes and how this work relates to earthquake hazard assessment. His research currently focuses on how earthquakes and faults interact through the transfer of stress. Examples of such interactions include aftershock sequences, seismic quiescence, earthquake clusters, and the propagation of mainshocks along a fault. Stein and his collaborators are interested in how one earthquake can promote subsequent shocks at some sites and inhibit seismic activity at other sites.   
  
The lecture is sponsored by UCSC's Center for the Study of Imaging and Dynamics of the Earth. A reception will be held at the Seymour Center after the lecture. The doors will open at 7 p.m. For special accommodations, please call (831) 459-4089.
