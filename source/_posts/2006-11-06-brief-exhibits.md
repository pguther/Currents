  The Eloise Pickard Smith Gallery at Cowell College opens two new shows this week, "David Fleming: Retrospective" in the Main Gallery, and "Lynn Zachreson: Figurative Works" in the Annex Gallery. Both shows will be up through Friday, December 1.
</p>
<p>
  The retrospective exhibit of David Fleming's work just scratches the surface of the past 10 years of this prolific Santa Cruz-based painter's career and focuses on what he has called his "contemporary expressionist" work. With clear links to the work of the German Expressionist painter Max Beckmann and the American painter of working class life Raphael Soyer, Fleming's work is boldly executed and often intriguingly narrative.
</p>
<p>
  "Lynn Zachreson: Figurative Works" presents large-scale watercolors of the female nude painted in rich saturated colors. Representing a 20-year exploration of texture, color, and line, Zachreson's works reveal the unique relationship between the physical body and the spirit that animates it. Rather than portraits, these works are a product of the artist's singular vision and intend to express gestures that recall a sense of self in a moment of time.
</p>
<p>
  Gallery hours are Tuesday through Sunday, 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Both exhibits are free and open to the public. For more information, visit the <a href="http://cowell.ucsc.edu/smith_gallery">gallery web site</a>.
