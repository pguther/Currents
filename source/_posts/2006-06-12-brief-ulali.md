[Ulali][1] First Nations Women Acapella Trio will perform on the Amphitheater Stage at the Arboretum on Thursday, June 15. Doors open at 5:30 p.m. and the show begins at 6:30 p.m. The concert is the second in the Arboretum's [Third Thursday Music Series][2].

Founded over 15 years ago, Ulali was the first Native women's group to create its own sound from traditional roots and personal contemporary styles. Ulali's sound encompasses an array of indigenous music including Southeast choral singing (pre-blues and gospel) and pre-Columbian (before the borders) music. With their beautiful yearning and powerful voices, they drum, rattle, and stomp. Their performances address Native struggles and accomplishments.

Other performers in the series include the Tish Hinojosa Trio on July 20, Sista Monica on August 17, Toshi Reagon on September 21, and The Lalo Guerrero Tribute Concert on October 19. Check the [Arboretum][3] web site for schedules, ticket sales, and concert information.

Tickets are available in advance at Norrie's Gift Shop at the Arboretum, open 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. daily; Logos Bookstore in downtown Santa Cruz, open 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. daily; and also at the door, if tickets remain on day of show. Tickets are $13 advance, $15 at the door (Arboretum members $13 at all times.)
