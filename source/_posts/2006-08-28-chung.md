Linguistics professor Sandra Chung has been elected a Fellow of the Linguistic Society of America in recognition of her "extraordinary contributions and service to the discipline."

She will participate in a formal induction ceremony for newly elected fellows this January at the annual meeting of the society in Anaheim, California.

Chung, a syntactician, is a leading authority on Austronesian languages, especially Chamorro, which is spoken in the Mariana Islands. Much of her latest research is on the interface of syntax and semantics and has been done in collaboration with Vice Provost and Dean of Undergraduate Education William A. Ladusaw.

In 2004, Chung was appointed to the Office of the Campus Provost and Executive Vice Chancellor as faculty assistant. This part-time position was created to assist the executive vice chancellor with issues related to academic personnel. Since joining UCSC in 1986, Chung has also served as chair of the Linguistics Department, chair of the Philosophy Department; chair and member of the Committee on Academic Personnel; and member of the UC Merced Committee on Academic Personnel.
