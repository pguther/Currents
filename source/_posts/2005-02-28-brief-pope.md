The UCSC Arts Research Institute will present a lecture by visual and performance artist William Pope.L on Monday March 7, at 7 p.m. in Classroom Unit I. The event is part of the institute's Visiting Artist Lecture Series and is free and open to the public.

Pope.L has been hailed as one of the premier African American artists whose multidisciplinary art practice continues to challenge and confront constructions of race. His works include such pieces as the _Community Crawls, Anglo-Vision, Coon_, the _Great White Way_, and _Eracism_. He has had recent solo exhibitions and performances at the The Project, New York, and has been featured at the Cleveland Center for Contemporary Art, the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, and the Drawing Center in New York. He also exhibited in the 2002 Whitney Biennial.

Pope.L's awards include fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts, the Maine Arts Commission, Franklin Furnace Award, a Rockefeller Foundation Multi-Purpose Arts Grant, and a Creative Capital Foundation Grant. This Visiting Artist Lecture has been made possible through the support of the Arts Research Institute and the Art Department. For more information, contact: [estephe@ucsc.edu][1].
