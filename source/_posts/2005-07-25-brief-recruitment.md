Staff Human Resources is implementing a new online Recruitment Management System (RMS) on September 6. This web-based system will facilitate and automate many of the labor-intensive, paper-driven aspects of the staff recruitment and hiring process.

Updated information about RMS is now available on the [RMS web site][1]. Recent additions include frequently-asked questions, a downloadable flier that includes key dates of the transition, a PowerPoint presentation made to Staff Human Resources coordinators on July 20, and a link to the recent announcement about RMS that was distributed through the administrative e-mail tree.

For more information about RMS, contact Lori Castro, Staff Human Resources employment manager, at (831) 459-2960.
