<p>
  Staff Human Resources is implementing a new online Recruitment Management System (RMS) on September 6. This web-based system will facilitate and automate many of the labor-intensive, paper-driven aspects of the staff recruitment and hiring process.
</p>
<p>
  Updated information about RMS is now available on the <a href="http://bas.ucsc.edu/btp/rms.html">RMS web site</a>. Recent additions include frequently-asked questions, a downloadable flier that includes key dates of the transition, a PowerPoint presentation made to Staff Human Resources coordinators on July 20, and a link to the recent announcement about RMS that was distributed through the administrative e-mail tree.
</p>
<p>
  For more information about RMS, contact Lori Castro, Staff Human Resources employment manager, at (831) 459-2960.
