The African American Theater Arts Troupe will present _Don't Get God Started_ by Ron Milner at the UCSC Second Stage Theater February 23-25 and in March at two other locations in the community. The play is produced and directed by Don Williams, who founded the troupe.

Written in the mid-1980s, this former broadway production deals with the complexity of relationships that stand in need of healing work and progress. This play provides a dramatic backdrop of action and conflict, yet is pregnant with resolution and hope. It is filled with an array of inspirational, heartfelt, uplifting, spirit-strengthening, hand-clapping, foot-stomping, infectious gospel music.

The production is sponsored by UCSC Student Affairs, the Council on Ethnic Programming, Center for Cultural Arts and Diversity, Student Initiated Outreach, UCSC Division of the Arts, Monterey Peninsula College, and UCSC Theater Arts Department.

Performance schedule:

* UCSC Second Stage, February 23 and 24 at 7 p.m. and February 25 at 2 p.m. Tickets are $13/general admission, $9/students (non-UCSC), free for UCSC students.
* Santa Cruz High Auditorium, March 2 and 3, 7 p.m. Tickets are $13/general admission, $9/all students.
* Oldemeyer Center in Seaside, March 10 at 7 p.m. (Ticket prices to be announced.)
