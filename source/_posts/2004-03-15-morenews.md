Mopeds banned from campus bike path  

![][1]

University Police, responding to recommendations from the University Transportation Advisory Committee, have changed campus traffic statutes to ban gas-powered motorized scooters--including mopeds--from the bike path through the Great Meadow. Interim Police Captain Nancy Carroll reported the change at the advisory committee's March 10 meeting.  

"We felt that due to concerns raised about exhaust emissions and noise, that gas-powered scooters should not be allowed to operate on the bike path," Carroll said. "This change will also make our policies more consistent with the city of Santa Cruz."  

Emissions and noise were among the reasons bicycle advocates had asked the Transportation Advisory Committee to examine the issue. Electric bikes will still be allowed to use the bike path under the provisions of the amended statute.

UCSC student struck by shuttle bus   

UCSC student Brandon Ruiz was struck by a campus shuttle bus on Thursday, March 11, at approximately 1:50 p.m. The accident occurred on Heller Drive near Kresge College. Mr. Ruiz was taken to Stanford Medical Center in the Life Flight helicopter with a head laceration, broken leg and scrapes. He was released in time to return to class activities on Monday, March 15.  

The cause of the accident is being investigated. There also was a minor injury to a passenger in the shuttle, requiring treatment at the scene.

Prison expert Craig Haney interviewed for upcoming show  

Psychology's Craig Haney, an expert on super maximum-security prisons, was interviewed by the producers of the upcoming television special, _Engineering Supermax Prisons._ The program will air March 18 at 10 p.m. on the [Learning Channel][2], and again March 19 at 1 a.m.   

Haney, who specializes in the psychological aspects of prison incarceration, spent several hours with the producers and appears briefly on the program.   
Described as an "unforgettable journey into the heart of the American prison system," the program gives viewers a tour of isolation units where prisoners are kept in solitary cells up to 23 hours a day. Prison designers, guards, and inmates are featured in the program.  

Designed to hold the most violent criminals, supermax prisons confine high-profile felons, those who belong to prison gangs, and prisoners who have killed fellow inmates or prison guards.   

But conditions inside supermax facilities can lead to long-term psychological disorders--and advance the suffering of mentally ill individuals, says Haney, who has studied inmates in supermax prisons in more than a dozen states. Haney's testimony in a Texas case was influential in a judge's landmark declaration that supermax prison conditions constituted "cruel and unusual" punishment.
