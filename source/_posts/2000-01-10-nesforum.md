In the wake of an [Academic Senate][1] meeting in December that was called to consider a proposal to replace the campus's Narrative Evaluation System with UC's conventional grading system, the senate has scheduled two forums in January in order to solicit campus input about the way in which student performance at UCSC is assessed. In addition, the annual Convocation on Teaching, scheduled for Monday, February 14 (changed from Friday, February 11), will explore the subject: "NES and Pedagogy: Are Narrative Evaluations Important to Teaching and Learning at UCSC?"

The two forums this month will take place on Tuesday, January 18, from 4 to 5:45 p.m. in the Media Theater, and on Monday, January 24, from 4 to 6 p.m. in Classroom Unit 2.

Members of the campus community who are interested in submitting proposals for discussion at one of the two forums are asked to do so at least five days in advance of either forum. Proposals should be sent to the senate office ([senate@cats][2] or 125 Kerr Hall).

The February 14 convocation will take place from 3:30 to 5:30 p.m. in Classroom Unit 2.

For more information, call (831) 459-2086.
