  <a name="Volunteer" id="Volunteer"></a><font color="#003399"><b>Volunteer training classes at the Arboretum</b></font>
</p>
<p>
  The Arboretum is offering a volunteer training class on Wednesdays from 9:30 a.m. to noon for six weeks, January 9 through February 13. The class is a wonderful opportunity to learn more about the Arboretum's collections, gardening in our Mediterranean climate, and the role of public gardens in plant conservation. No experience is necessary. The class is free, but attendees are expected to buy a book: <i>Plants of the World's Mediterranean Climates,</i> by Peter Dallman (approximately $28). The majority of the time will be spent out in the gardens. The Arboretum's collections include extensive Australian, New Zealand, South African, and Californian gardens.
</p>
<p>
  The Arboretum staff hopes some who attend will become inspired to join their community of volunteers who greet visitors, repot plants, help with plant sales, and work in the gardens. The class will be held at the Horticulture Building. New members can preregister by calling (831) 427-2998, or just show up at the first class.<br>
  <br>
  Those interested in leading tours can attend the Tour Guide Training class on February 20 and 27, led by Phyllis Norris and Stephen McCabe. Training is free. Call (831) 427-2998 for information or optional preregistration.<br>
