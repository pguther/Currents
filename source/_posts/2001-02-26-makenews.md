UCSC's role in the Human Genome Project was highlighted in the _New York Times_ in a story on the front page of the science section about the work of **Jim Kent,** a graduate student in biology, and **David Haussler,** professor of computer science. The article characterized Kent as "a surprising hero" of the genome project for writing the computer program that assembled the first draft of the human genome sequence. The most striking praise came from the chief rival of the public genome consortium, Craig Venter of Celera Genomics, who said, "What Haussler did was he came in and saved [the consortium]. Haussler put it all together." Kent and Haussler's work was also featured in the _San Francisco Chronicle,_ _San Jose Mercury News,_ and _Santa Cruz Sentinel._ Haussler was interviewed by KGO radio in San Francisco and so many other media outlets, he said, "I lost track--the phone was ringing off the hook."

**Gary Bloom**, associate director of the New Teacher Center, was interviewed by Univision, the Spanish-language television network, during the center's recent annual conference in San Jose.

As the postelection fallout continues, Nat Hentoff, writing in the _Village Voice,_ quoted political scientist **Gwendolyn Mink** on the Supreme Court's decision.

Chadwick Garden manager **Orin Martin** was featured in a _Santa Cruz Sentinel_ gardening article about potatoes.
