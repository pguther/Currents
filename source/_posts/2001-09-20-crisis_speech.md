  The services of the Office of Equal Employment Opportunity/Affirmative Action (EEO/AA) are available to anyone who feels they have been the target of any hostile speech or harassment. Times like these can trigger behaviors that are unwelcome, and it is important that we all ensure that our campus continues to be a safe and respectful community for all.
</p>
<p>
  EEO/AA Director Patti Hiramoto reiterates sentiments that have been shared throughout the campus: "As we deal with our emotions, both individually and collectively, it is important that our fears and anger not be turned towards each other and particularly not towards persons of Arab descent or other persons of color. This is a time for the campus to come together in our grieving for the many victims of this travesty."

  Hiramoto and Mercedes Santos of the EEO/AA Office can be reached at Ext 9-2349 or 9-3676.<br>
