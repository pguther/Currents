  On August 3, Larry Merkley, vice provost of information technology, officially welcomed 75 IT staff from around campus into the new ITS organization. IT staff were welcomed from the following divisions: Physical and Biological Sciences, Social Sciences, Humanities, Arts, Library, Student Affairs, University Relations, Business Administrative Services, and University Extension. The transition of IT staff from the School of Engineering will take place in the coming months.

<p>
  Two ITS All-Hands meetings to welcome new staff into the organization and to provide additional information about the transition are scheduled this month: on Wednesday, August 10, and on Wednesday, August 24. ITS staff should attend one or both of these sessions, which will give staff an opportunity to meet with ITS directors and other staff, and to ask specific questions about the transition. <a href="http://its.ucsc.edu/newsletter/full_story.php?id=218">[Full story, including Q&amp;A]</a>
