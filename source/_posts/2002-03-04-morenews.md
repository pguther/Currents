### **Engineering dean Kang gives keynote speech at S.C. Tech Symposium**

Steve Kang, dean of the Baskin School of Engineering, was the keynote speaker at the Santa Cruz Technology Exhibition and Symposium, held last week at the Cocoanut Grove and the WestCoast Santa Cruz Hotel. The third annual symposium brought together the technology community of the Monterey Bay region, providing sales and marketing opportunities for regional vendors of technology goods and services.   
  
In his talk, Kang emphasized the importance of strong partnerships between UCSC and the region's high-tech industry.   
  
"We must develop close ties to local industry in Santa Cruz and Scotts Valley, as well as in Silicon Valley," he said.  
  
Kang described the engineering school's existing strengths and his plans to focus on three areas of excellence: information technology, biotechnology, and nanotechnology. He noted that UCSC's involvement in two of the multicampus California Institutes for Science and Innovation--the Institute for Bioengineering, Biotechnology, and Quantitative Biomedical Research (QB3) and the Center for Information Technology Research in the Interest of Society (CITRIS)--will help stimulate research in these areas.

### Support breast cancer research when you file your taxes

If you haven't filed your taxes yet, here's an easy way to support the search for a cure for breast cancer. Line 56 on the 2001 California Income Tax Return Form 540 provides an opportunity to make a donation from your tax refund--or add to your tax bill a contribution--to the Breast Cancer Research Fund. The [California Breast Cancer Research Program,][8] which is administered by the University of California, spearheads research efforts into the causes, prevention, detection, and treatment of breast cancer.   
  
Breast cancer is the most common cancer to strike women in California. In 2002, it is estimated that more than 20,000 women will be diagnosed with breast cancer in California alone, and more than 4,200 women in the state will die of the disease. For more information about the research your contributions will help to support, go to the [California Breast Cancer Research Fund][9] web site.
