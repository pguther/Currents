Student accomplishments in the Humanities Division will be highlighted on June 1 and 2 at three separate events during UCSC's Student Achievement Week.

**Linguistics Undergraduate Research Conference**

The Linguistics Undergraduate Research Conference is an annual event that features presentations of the most significant research by students majoring in linguistics or language studies during the current academic year. A large number of linguistics undergraduates, as well as most of the department's graduate students and faculty, attend this conference.   

A highlight of the event is a keynote presentation by a graduate with a B.A. in linguistics or language studies from UCSC. This year's keynote speaker is Gina Taranto, who graduated in 1994 with a B.A. in linguistics from Kresge College with honors. She went on to earn a Ph.D. in linguistics at UC San Diego and currently holds the position of discourse analyst/linguist at H5 Technologies in San Francisco.  

The conference will take place on Wednesday, June 1, from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. in the Silverman Conference Room at Stevenson College.  

** Literature Undergraduate Colloquium**  

This annual event showcases and celebrates undergraduate academic work in the Literature Department. The colloquium is a daylong series of panel presentations in which the students present academic papers on a range of topics, sharing them with an audience of faculty, students, and family. The event--free and open to the public--takes place on Thursday, June 2, in Kresge College, Room 159. Contact the Literature Department at (831) 459-4778 or e-mail [litdept@ucsc.edu][1] for the schedule of presentations.
