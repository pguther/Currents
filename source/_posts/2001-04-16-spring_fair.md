  Prospective students can take advantage of academic advising, attend workshops explaining UCSC's college system and financial aid, and attend a range of panel discussions. College tours get under way at 10 a.m. and continue until 3 p.m. (See <a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/currents/00-01/03-12/fair.html">earlier story</a>.)
