Current and prospective students will be joined by parents and alumni on Saturday, April 21 for UCSC's annual Banana Slug Spring Fair.  
  
An array of special events, including reunions for alumni and academic information fairs for prospective students, a student block party, dance performance, tours, and a nature walk, are on the schedule.

Prospective students can take advantage of academic advising, attend workshops explaining UCSC's college system and financial aid, and attend a range of panel discussions. College tours get under way at 10 a.m. and continue until 3 p.m. (See [earlier story][1].)
